               Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. 
The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear.  Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstriction assays are used to compare and predict potencies and or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids.  There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictive potency and therapeutic efficacy in man.
