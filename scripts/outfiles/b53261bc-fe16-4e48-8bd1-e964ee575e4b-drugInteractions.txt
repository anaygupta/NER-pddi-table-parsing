                  No drug interaction studies have been conducted with Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide and other drugs, although studies have been conducted with the individual components. A pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction study has been conducted to address the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between the triple combination, Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide, and the corresponding three double combinations. No clinically relevant interaction was observed.
                  
                     Amlodipine
                  
                  
                     Simvastatin: Co-administration of simvastin with amlodipine increases the systemic exposure of simvastatin. Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on amlodipine to 20 mg daily. 
                  
                     CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors (moderate and stronge) result in increased systemic exposure to amlodipine warranting dose reduction. Monitor for symptoms of hypotension and edema when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors to determine the need for dose adjustment.
                  
                     CYP3A4 Inducers: No information is available on the quantitative effects if CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be monitored when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inducers.
                  
                     Valsartan
                  
                  No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when valsartan was co-administered with amlodipine, atenolol, cimetidine, digoxin, furosemide, glyburide, hydrochlorothiazide, or indomethacin. The valsartan-atenolol combination was more antihypertensive than either component, but it did not lower the heart rate more than atenolol alone.
                  In vitro metabolism studies have indicated that CYP450 mediated drug interaction between valsartan and co¬administered drugs are unlikely because of the low extent of metabolism [see Pharmacokinetics - Valsartan, 12.3]. 
                  Co-administration of valsartan and warfarin did not change the pharmacokinetics of valsartan or the time-course of the anticoagulant properties of warfarin.
                  
                     Potassium: Concomitant use of valsartan with other agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium and in heart failure patients to increases in serum creatinine. If co-medication is considered necessary, monitoring of serum potassium is advisable.
                  
                     Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving valsartan and NSAID therapy.
                  The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 
                  Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy [see Clinical Trials 14.3]. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS. 
                  Do not coadminister aliskiren with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60mL/min).
                  
                     Valsartan – Hydrochlorothiazide
                  
                  Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or thiazides. Monitor lithium levels patients taking amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide.
                  
                     Hydrochlorothiazide
                  
                  Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin): Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. 
                  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors): When amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of diuretic is obtained.
                  Carbamazepine: May lead to symptomatic hyponatremia. 
                  Ion exchange resins: Staggering the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol) such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially minimize the interaction. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  Cyclosporine: Concomitant treatment with cyclosporine may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout-type complications.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        If simvastatin is co-administered with amlodipine, do not exceed doses greater than 20 mg daily of simvastatin (7)
