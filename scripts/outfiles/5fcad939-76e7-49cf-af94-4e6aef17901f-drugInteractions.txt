                  TANZEUM did not affect the absorption of orally administered medications tested in clinical pharmacology studies to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. However, TANZEUM causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with TANZEUM.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        TANZEUM delays gastric emptying. May impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. (7)
