                     7.2 Drugs Eliminated by Active Tubular Secretion
                     
                        Although demonstrated in a drug-drug interaction study not to affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, trospium chloride tablets have the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion (e.g., procainamide, pancuronium, morphine, vancomycin, and tenofovir). Co-administration of trospium chloride tablets with these drugs may increase the serum concentration of trospium chloride tablets and/or the coadministered drug due to competition for this elimination pathway. Careful patient monitoring is recommended in patients receiving such drugs [see

                            7.3 Antimuscarinic Agents 
                     
                        The concomitant use of trospium chloride tablets with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Trospium chloride tablets may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility.

                        Co-administration of 500 mg metformin immediate release tablets twice daily with trospium chloride 60 mg extended release tablets reduced the steady-state systemic exposure of trospium by approximately 29% for mean AUC0-24 and by 34% for mean Cmax [see
