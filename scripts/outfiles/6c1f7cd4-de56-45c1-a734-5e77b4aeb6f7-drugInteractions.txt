                        Iron salts and dopamine D2 antagonists including metoclopramide: May reduce the effectiveness of RYTARY (7.2, 7.3)
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors
                     
                        The use of nonselective MAO inhibitors with RYTARY is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue use of any nonselective MAO inhibitors at least two weeks prior to initiating RYTARY.
                        The use of selective MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., rasagiline and selegiline) with RYTARY may be associated with orthostatic hypotension. Monitor patients who are taking these drugs concurrently.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists and Isoniazid
                     
                        Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone, metoclopramide) and isoniazid may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa. Monitor patients for worsening Parkinson's symptoms.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Iron Salts
                     
                        Iron salts or multi-vitamins containing iron salts can form chelates with levodopa and carbidopa and can cause a reduction in the bioavailability of RYTARY. If iron salts or multi-vitamins containing iron salts are coadministered with RYTARY, monitor patients for worsening Parkinson's symptoms.
