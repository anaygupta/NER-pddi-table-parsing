                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine and is also one of the active moieties of tolterodine tartrate tablets and tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules.
                        Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Cardiac Electrophysiology:
                                  The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia's correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin.
                              Toviaz is associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. In the study described above, when compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with a dose of 4 mg/day and 28 mg/day of fesoterodine was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively.
                              In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increase in heart rate compared to placebo was approximately 3–4 beats/minute in the 4 mg/day group and 3–5 beats/minute in the 8 mg/day group.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Absorption: 
                                 After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration.
                              A summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of Toviaz 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 2.
                              


                           



                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Effect of Food: 
                                 There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and Cmax by 18% [see Dosage and Administration (2)].
                              
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Distribution: 
                                 Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Metabolism: 
                                 After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine.
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Excretion: 
                                 Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces.
                              The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours.

In the same study, the mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52.0 ± 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 ± 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)

                                        The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73.0 ± 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 ± 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax in Black males were 65.8 ± 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 ± 1.9 ng/mL, respectively.

                                        At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions (7.5)
                                       ].
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          CYP3A4 Inhibitors:
                                         Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of Toviaz 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. Cmax and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the Cmax and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Cmax and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole.
                                    There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% – 28%) and 27% (18% – 36%) respectively.
                                    The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2)

The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed.

                                          Oral Contraceptives:
                                         Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period crossover study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 – 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and Cmax of ethinyl estradiol by 1 – 3% and decreased the AUC and Cmax of levonorgestrel by 11 – 13% [see Drug Interactions (7.6)

                                          Warfarin:
                                        In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18–55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the Cmax and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the Cmax and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the co-administration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction.
                                    There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anti-coagulant activity of warfarin (INRmax, AUCINR), with only a small decrease noted in INRmax of ~ 3 % with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions (7.7)
                                       ].
