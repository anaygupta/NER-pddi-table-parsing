                  Intravenous infusion of R-Gene 10 often induces a pronounced rise in the plasma level of human growth hormone (HGH) in subjects with intact pituitary function.

These ranges are based on the mean values of plasma HGH levels calculated from the data of several clinical investigators and reflect their experiences with various methods of radioimmunoassay. Upon gaining experience with this diagnostic test, each clinician will establish his/her own ranges for control and peak levels of HGH.
