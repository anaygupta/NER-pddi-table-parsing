                  Following its intravenous administration, technetium Tc-99m pentetate rapidly distributes itself throughout the extracellular fluid space from which it is promptly cleared from the body. The mechanism of excretion from the body is by glomerular filtration. There should be little or no binding of the chelate by the renal parenchyma. A variable percentage of the technetium Tc-99m pentetate binds to the serum proteins; this ranges from 3.7% following a single injection to approximately 10% if the material is continuously infused. Although the chelate gives useful information on the glomerular filtration rate, the variable percent which is protein bound leads to a measured clearance rate which is lower than that determined by inulin clearance.

                     
The images of the kidneys obtained in the first few minutes after administration of technetium Tc-99m pentetate represent the vascular pool within the kidney. Subsequent images of the kidneys represent radioactivity which is in the urine of both the collection system and the renal pelvis.

                     
Technetium Tc-99m pentetate tends to accumulate in intra-cranial lesions with excessive neovascularity or an altered blood-brain barrier. It does not accumulate in the choroid plexus.
