                  Sodium polysulthionate: consists of a biologically active sulfur based nutrients in a proprietary matrix of alpha sulfur, sodium sulfate, and sodium thiosulfate derived from food sources. In a study of health controls and heart failure patients, oral sodium polysulthionate increased hydrogens sulfide and nitric oxide levels (p<0.05).1
                  
                  
                     
                     
Folate: folate is essential for the production of certain coenzymes in many metabolic systems such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis. Through one-carbon metabolism 5-methyltetrahydrofolate plays an essential role in homocysteine metabolism. Homocysteine metabolizes in the body to produce hydrogen sulfied, which is a strong antioxidant and vasorelaxation factor. At an elevated level, homocysteine inactivates proteins by homocysteinylation including its endogenous metabolizing enzyme, cystathionine gamma-lyase. Thus, there is a reduced production of endogenous hydrogen sulfide during hyperhomocysteinemia.12 5-methyltetrahydrofolate along with methylcobolamin is an essential co-factor in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine.13
