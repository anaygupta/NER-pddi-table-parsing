                     12.1  Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Raplixa contains a spray-dried mixture of human plasma-derived fibrinogen and human plasma-derived thrombin powders that are designed to mimic the final steps in the coagulation cascade. Raplixa dissolves readily on contact with aqueous fluids (e.g., blood) activating thrombin which triggers an immediate conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin, and subsequent clot formation.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3	Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Formal pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed. Because Raplixa is applied only topically, systemic exposure or distribution to other organs or tissues is not expected.
