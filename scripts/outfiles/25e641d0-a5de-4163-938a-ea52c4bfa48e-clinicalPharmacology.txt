                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL is an antibacterial drug. [see Microbiology 12.4]
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Mean amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium pharmacokinetic parameters in normal adults following administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate Powder for Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets are shown in Table 3.
                        


                        


Oral administration of 5 mL of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL or the equivalent dose of 10 mL of 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium provides average peak serum concentrations approximately 1 hour after dosing of 6.9 mcg/mL for amoxicillin and 1.6 mcg/mL for clavulanic acid. The areas under the serum concentration curves obtained during the first 4 hours after dosing were 12.6 mcg.hr/mL for amoxicillin and 2.9 mcg.hr/mL for clavulanic acid when 5 mL of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL or equivalent dose of 10 mL of 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was administered to adult volunteers. One 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium or two 125 mg/31.25 mg chewable tablets of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are equivalent to 5 mL of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL and provide similar serum levels of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.
                        Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are similar to those produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone. Time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of 1 mcg/mL for amoxicillin has been shown to be similar after corresponding q12h and q8h dosing regimens of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in adults and children.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Absorption: Dosing in the fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin. While Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate potassium when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state. In one study, the relative bioavailability of clavulanate was reduced when Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium was dosed at 30 and 150 minutes after the start of a high-fat breakfast.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Distribution: Neither component in Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium is highly protein-bound; clavulanic acid is approximately 25% bound to human serum and amoxicillin approximately 18% bound.
                              Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid.
                              Two hours after oral administration of a single 35 mg/kg dose of suspension of to Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium to fasting children, average concentrations of 3 mcg/mL of amoxicillin and 0.5 mcg/mL of clavulanic acid were detected in middle ear effusions.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Metabolism and Excretion: The half-life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium is 1.3 hours and that of clavulanic acid is 1 hour.
                              Approximately 50% to 70% of the amoxicillin and approximately 25% to 40% of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in urine during the first 6 hours after administration of a single 250 mg/125 mg or 500 mg/125 mg tablet of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.4 Microbiology
                     
                        Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic with in vitro bactericidal activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Amoxicillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by β-lactamases, and therefore, the spectrum of activity does not include organisms which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a β-lactam, structurally related to the penicillins, which possesses the ability to inactivate some β-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. In particular, it has good activity against the clinically important plasmid-mediated β-lactamases frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance.
                        The formulation of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium protects amoxicillin from degradation by β-lactamase enzymes and extends the antibiotic spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin.
                        Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.

                                 To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL and other antibacterial drugs, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. 
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Susceptibility Test Methods
                              
                              When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drug products used in resident hospitals to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug product for treatment.
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    Dilution techniques
                                    Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method2,3 (broth and/or agar). The MIC values should be interpreted according to criteria provided in Table 4.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    Diffusion techniques:
                                    Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized test method3, 4. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanic acid) to test the susceptibility of bacteria to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The disc diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 4.
                                    


                                 



                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    Quality Control:
                                    Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test2,3,4. Standard amoxicillin/clavulanic acid powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 5 for the diffusion technique using the 30 mcg amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanic acid) disk, the criteria in Table 5 should be achieved.
