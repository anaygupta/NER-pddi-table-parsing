                  Based on in vitro studies, APRISO is not expected to inhibit the
                            metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19,
                            CYP2D6, or CYP3A4.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                            Do not co-administer with antacids (7.1)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Antacids
                     
                        Because the dissolution of the coating of the granules in
                                    APRISO capsules depends on pH, APRISO capsules should not be
                                    co-administered with antacids.
