                  REGONOL® (pyridostigmine bromide injection USP), an analogue of neostigmine, facilitates the transmission of impulses across the myoneural junction by inhibiting the destruction of acetylcholine by cholinesterase. Currently available data indicate that pyridostigmine may have a significantly lower degree and incidence of bradycardia, salivation and gastrointestinal stimulation than does neostigmine. Animal studies using the injectable form of pyridostigmine and human studies using the oral preparation have indicated that pyridostigmine has a longer duration of action than does neostigmine measured under similar circumstances.1,2 REGONOL® is effective in reversing the neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.
                  Anticholinesterase agents such as REGONOL® and neostigmine may produce depolarization block when administered at doses above their recommended therapeutic ranges. The therapeutic index of REGONOL® (ratio of reversal dose to blocking dose) is approximately 1:6 (see 
                        OVERDOSAGE
                     ).3
                  
                  The antagonism of neuromuscular blockade by anticholinesterase agents may be influenced by the degree of spontaneous recovery achieved when the reversal agent is administered, by the particular relaxant administered, acid-base balance, body temperature, electrolyte imbalance, concomitant medications such as potent inhalational anesthetics, antibiotics or other drugs which enhance or antagonize the action of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.4 The use of peripheral nerve stimulation to determine the degree of neuromuscular blockade is recommended in evaluating the effects of the reversal agents.
                  Failure of anticholinesterase agents to produce prompt (within 30 minutes) reversal of neuromuscular blockade may occur in the presence of extreme debilitation, carcinomatosis, and with concomitant use of certain broad-spectrum antibiotics, or anesthetic agents and other drugs which enhance neuromuscular blockade or cause respiratory depression through their own pharmacologic actions.
                  As with other anticholinesterase agents, the administration of REGONOL® may be associated with muscarinic and nicotinic side effects, notably bradycardia and excessive bronchial secretions; the use of glycopyrrolate or atropine sulfate simultaneously with or prior to administration of REGONOL® is recommended to counteract these side effects (see

                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        It has been postulated that the clearance of pyridostigmine is almost equally dependent on metabolism and on urinary elimination of the unchanged drug.6 Other studies in man indicated that approximately 75 percent of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine is dependent on renal excretion and the remainder on nonrenal mechanisms.7
