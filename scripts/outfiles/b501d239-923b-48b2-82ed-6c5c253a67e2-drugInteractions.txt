                        Oraqix should be used with caution in combination with dental injection anesthesia, other local anesthetics, or agents structurally related to local anesthetics, e.g., Class 1 antiarrhythmics such as tocainide and mexiletine, as the toxic effects of these drugs are likely to be additive and potentially synergistic.

                        Patients taking drugs associated with drug-induced methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine are also at greater risk for developing methemoglobinemia [See OVERDOSAGE (10) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
