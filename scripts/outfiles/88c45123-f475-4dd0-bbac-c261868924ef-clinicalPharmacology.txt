                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The mechanism of trazodone’s antidepressant action is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic activity in the CNS. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Preclinical studies have shown that trazodone selectively inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin and acts as an antagonist at 5-HT-2A/2C serotonin receptors. 
                        Trazodone is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and, unlike amphetamine-type drugs, does not stimulate the central nervous system.
                        Trazodone antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, a property which may be associated with postural hypotension.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Steady state AUC of Trazodone is equivalent after administration of Trazodone 100 mg immediate release (IR) three (3) times a day (mean ± SD AUCss = 33058 ± 8006 ng*h/mL) and Oleptro 300 mg once daily (mean ± SD AUCss = 29131 ± 9931 ng*h/mL)  for one week. Steady State Cmax and Cmin of trazodone were not equivalent after administration of trazodone 100 mg IR 3 times a day (mean ± SD Cmax,ss = 3118 ± 758 ng/mL, Cmin,ss = 843 ± 274 ng/mL) and Oleptro 300 mg once daily (mean ± SD Cmax,ss = 1812 ± 621 ng/mL, Cmin,ss = 674 ± 355 ng/mL) for one week.
                        
                           Absorption
                           

Trazodone is well absorbed after oral administration, without selective localization in any tissue. Following single-dose administration of Oleptro 300 mg tablets under fasting conditions, a mean peak trazodone plasma concentration (Cmax) of 1188 ± 362 ng/mL was reported at a median Tmax of 9 hours post-dose. When Oleptro 300 mg tablets are taken shortly after ingestion of a high-fat meal, Cmax increases by about 86% compared to taking it under fasting conditions. However, AUC0-∞ and Tmax are not significantly affected by food.
                        Oleptro tablets are dose proportional following single-dose administration of doses ranging from 75 mg to 375 mg as intact or bisected tablets.  
                        
                           Metabolism
                           

                           In vitro studies in human liver microsomes show that trazodone is metabolized, via oxidative cleavage, to an active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) by CYP3A4. Other metabolic pathways that may be involved in the metabolism of trazodone have not been well characterized. Trazodone is extensively metabolized; less than 1% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.
                        
                           Elimination
                           

Elimination is predominantly renal, with 70 to 75% of an oral dose being recovered in the urine within the first 72 hours of ingestion. Following single-dose administration of Oleptro 300 mg tablets, a mean apparent terminal half-life of 10 hours was reported.
                        
                           Protein Binding
                           

Trazodone is 89 to 95% protein bound in vitro at concentrations attained with therapeutic doses in humans.
