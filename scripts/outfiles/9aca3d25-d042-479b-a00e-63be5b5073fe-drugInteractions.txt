                  Do
not take this product if you are presently
taking, or have taken within the preceding
two
weeks, a prescription drug for high blood pressure or
depression without first consulting your physician.
Absorption
of other oral medications may be decreased
during concurrent use with anticholinergics
due
to decreased gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric
emptying.
                  
                  Combinations
containing any of the following medications,
depending on the amount present, may
also
interact with this product:
•
Alkalizers, such as: calcium and/or magnesium-containing
antacids; Carbonic inhibitors;
citrates;
sodium bicarbonate-urinary excretion of anticholinergics
may be delayed by alkalization of the
urine,
thus potentiating scopolamine methyl nitrate therapeutic
and/or side effects.
•
Antacids or adsorbent antidiarrheals-simultaneous use
of these medications may reduce absorption of
scopolamine
methyl nitrate, resulting in decreased therapeutic
effectiveness; doses of these should be
spaced
2 or 3 hours apart from doses of scopolamine
methyl nitrate.
•
Anticholinergics – Concurrent use with anticholinergic effects;
patients should be advised to report
occurrence
of gastrointestinal problems promptly since paralytic
ileus may occur with concurrent therapy.
• CNS
Depressants – Concurrent use of alcohol, antihistamines
with alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants,
barbiturates
and other CNS depressants may have an additive
effect.
•
Ketoconazole – Anticholinergics may increase gastrointestinal
pH, possibly resulting in a marked
reduction
in ketoconazole absorption during concurrent
use with anticholinergics; patients should be
advised
to take these medications at least 2 hours after
ketoconazole.
• MAO
inhibitors – Concurrent use may prolong and intensify
cardiac stimulate and vasopressor effects of
chlorpheniramine,
resulting in headache, cardiac arrhythmias,
vomiting or sudden and severe
hypertensive
and/or hyperpyretic crisis. These medications
should not be administered during
or
within 14 days following the administration of MAO inhibitor
therapy.
•
Metoclopramide – Concurrent use of metoclopramide with
anticholinergics may antagonize
metoclopramide’s
effects on gastrointestinal motility.
•
Potassium chloride – Concurrent use with anticholinergics
may increase the severity of
potassium
chloride-induced gastrointestinal lesions.
