                  Nutrilyte II Concentrate provides a source of intra- and extracellular electrolytes in suitable amounts, to help maintain normal cellular metabolism during total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and other parenteral therapy in adults. Use of properly diluted Nutrilyte II meets most adult daily electrolyte requirements and provides adjunctive therapy for replenishment of depleted electrolyte stores.

                     :Potassium, the principal intracellular cation, maintains the integrity of the cellular membrane, helps transport dextrose across the cell membrane and contributes to normal renal function: Magnesium, the second most concentrated intracellular cation, acts as an important cofactor in enzymatic reactions and helps to maintain normal central nervous system activity and amino acid utilization. Calcium participates in the maintenance of normal neuromuscular functions and blood coagulation.
                  
                     
                        Extracellular
                     
                     :Chloride, the primary extracellular anion, contributes to the maintenance of acid-base balance. Sodium, the principal extracellular cation, acts in conjunction with potassium to maintain integrity of the cell membrane. Sodium also helps to maintain motor nerve depolarization, normal renal metabolism and fluid balance. Acetate is a bicarbonate alternate and an important intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
