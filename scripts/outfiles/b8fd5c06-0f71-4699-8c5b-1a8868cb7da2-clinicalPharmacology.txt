                  When administered intravenously mannitol is confined to the extracellular space, only slightly metabolized and rapidly excreted by the kidney. Approximately 80% of a 100 g dose appears in the urine in 3 hours. The drug is freely filtered by the glomeruli with less than 10% tubular reabsorption; it is not secreted by tubular cells. Mannitol induces diuresis by elevating the osmolarity of the glomerular filtrate and thereby hindering tubular reabsorption of water. Excretion of sodium and chloride is also enhanced.
