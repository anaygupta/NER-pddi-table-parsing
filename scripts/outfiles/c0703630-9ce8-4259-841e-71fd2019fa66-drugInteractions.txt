                     7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs
                     
                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and FROVA within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 5-HT1B/1D Agonists
                     
                        Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of FROVA and other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors / Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome
                     
                        Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
