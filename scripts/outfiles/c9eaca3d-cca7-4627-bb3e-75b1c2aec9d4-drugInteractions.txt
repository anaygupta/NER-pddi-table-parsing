                           Urinary Acidifying Agents
                        
                        These agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
                        
                           Methenamine Therapy
                        
                        Urinary excretion of amphetamines is increased, and efficacy is reduced, by acidifying agents used in methenamine therapy.

                           Urinary Alkalinizing Agents
                        
                        These agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
                     
                         Dextroamphetamine is known to inhibit monoamine oxidase. 
                        MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism. This slowing potentiates amphetamines, increasing their effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings; this can cause headaches and other signs of hypertensive crisis. A variety of toxic neurological effects and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur, sometimes with fatal results. Do not administer Vyvanse during or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors [

                           Adrenergic Blockers
                        
                        Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines. 
                        
                           Antihistamines
                        
                        Amphetamines may counteract the sedative effect of antihistamines.
                        
                           Antihypertensives
                        
                        Amphetamines may antagonize the hypotensive effects of antihypertensives.
                        
                           Veratrum Alkaloids
                        
                        Amphetamines inhibit the hypotensive effect of veratrum alkaloids.
                        
                           Ethosuximide
                        
                        Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of ethosuximide.

                           Antidepressants, Tricyclic
                        
                        Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic antidepressants or sympathomimetic agents; d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated.

                           Phenobarbital
                        
                        Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenobarbital; co-administration of phenobarbital may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action.
                        
                           Phenytoin
                        
                        Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenytoin; co-administration of phenytoin may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action.

                           Chlorpromazine
                        
                        Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines, and can be used to treat amphetamine poisoning.
                        
                           Haloperidol
                        
                        Haloperidol blocks dopamine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines.
                        
                           Lithium Carbonate
                        
                        The anorectic and stimulatory effects of amphetamines may be inhibited by lithium carbonate.

                           Propoxyphene Overdosage
                        
                        In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur.

                        Amphetamines can cause a significant elevation in plasma corticosteroid levels. This increase is greatest in the evening. Amphetamine may interfere with urinary steroid determinations.
