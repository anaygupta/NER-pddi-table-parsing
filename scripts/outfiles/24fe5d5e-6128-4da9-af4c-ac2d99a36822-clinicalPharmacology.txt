                  When administered intravenously, these solutions provide a source 
of water and carbohydrate.
                  Isotonic and hypertonic concentrations of dextrose are suitable for 
parenteral maintenance of water requirements when salt is not needed or should 
be avoided.
                  Solutions containing carbohydrate in the form of dextrose restore blood 
glucose levels and provide calories. Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may 
aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein-sparing action. 
Dextrose injected parenterally undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide and 
water.
                  Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for 
approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirements 
range from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss 
by perspiration and urine production).
                  Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water 
distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body 
compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in 
maintaining physiologic equilibrium.
