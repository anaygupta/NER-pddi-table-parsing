                  No formal assessments of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between DepoCyt and other agents have been conducted.  Concomitant administration of DepoCyt with other antineoplastic agents administered by the intrathecal route has not been studied.  With intrathecal cytarabine and other cytotoxic agents administered intrathecally, enhanced neurotoxicity has been associated with coadministration of drugs.
