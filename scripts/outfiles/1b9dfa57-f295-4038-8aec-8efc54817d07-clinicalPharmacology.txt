                        The pharmacodynamics of SOLODYN for the treatment of acne are unknown.

                        SOLODYN Tablets are not bioequivalent to non-modified release minocycline products. Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, SOLODYN Tablets produce a delayed Tmax at 3.5–4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (Tmax at 2.25–3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0–24) and Cmax were 33.32 µg×hr/mL and 2.63 µg/mL for SOLODYN Tablets and 46.35 µg×hr/mL and 2.92 µg/mL for Minocin®  capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both products.
                        A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that SOLODYN Tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, SOLODYN Tablets 55 mg, 80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to SOLODYN Tablets 90 mg and 135 mg.
                        When SOLODYN Tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.
                        Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum.
