                            Lotion on native, captured lice suggest that benzyl alcohol inhibits lice from closing their respiratory spiracles, allowing the vehicle to obstruct the spiracles and causing the lice to asphyxiate.

	The absorption of benzyl alcohol from ULESFIA
                              ®
                            Lotion was evaluated in 19 subjects with head lice infestation. Subjects were divided into two age groups: 6 months to 3 years and 4 to 11 years.  ULESFIA
                              ®
                            Lotion was applied for an exaggerated exposure period (3 times the normal exposure period).  Benzyl alcohol was quantified in a single plasma sample in 4 out of 19 subjects (21%): three subjects in the 6 months to 3 years age group at 0.5 hour post-treatment (ranging from 1.97 to 2.99 mcg/mL) and one subject in the 4 to 11 year age group (1.63 mcg/mL) at 1 hour post-treatment out of a total of 102 samples analyzed.
