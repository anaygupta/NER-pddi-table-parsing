                  Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
                  (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. The
sodium salt
                  of naproxen has been developed as a more rapidly absorbed
formulation
                  of naproxen for use as an analgesic. The mechanism of action
of the
                  naproxen anion, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely
understood

but maybe related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.

                  Naproxen and naproxen sodium are rapidly and completely
                  absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an in vivo
bioavailability
                  of 95%. The different dosage forms of NAPROSYN are
bioequivalent in
                  terms of extent of absorption (AUC) and peak concentration
(Cmax); however, the products do differ in their pattern of absorption.
                  These differences between naproxen products are related to
both the
                  chemical form of naproxen used and its formulation. Even
with the
                  observed differences in pattern of absorption, the
elimination half-life
                  of naproxen is unchanged across products ranging from 12 to
17 hours.
                  Steady-state levels of naproxen are reached in 4 to 5 days,
and the
                  degree of naproxen accumulation is consistent with this
half-life.
                  This suggests that the differences in pattern of release
play only
                  a negligibie role in the attainment of steady-state plasma levels.
