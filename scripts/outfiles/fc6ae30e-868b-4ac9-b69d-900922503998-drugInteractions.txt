                     7.1 Positive Urine Glucose Test
                     
                        Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay
                     
                        Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.
