                              Interactions with Substrates, Inhibitors or Inducers of Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes
                           
                           
                              Because propranolol’s metabolism involves multiple pathways in the Cytochrome P-450 system (CYP2D6, 1A2, 2C19), coadministration with drugs that are metabolized by, or affect the activity (induction or inhibition) of one or more of these pathways may lead to clinically relevant drug interactions (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Substrates or Inhibitors of CYP2D6
                           
                           
                              Blood levels and/or toxicity of propranolol may be increased by coadministration with substrates or inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as amiodarone, cimetidine, delavudin, fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine and ritonavir. No interactions were observed with either ranitidine or lansoprazole.

                              Blood levels and/or toxicity of propranolol may be increased by coadministration with substrates or inhibitors of CYP1A2, such as imipramine, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, ritonavir, theophylline, zileuton, zolmitriptan and rizatriptan. 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Substrates or Inhibitors of CYP2C19
                           
                           
                              Blood levels and/or toxicity of propranolol may be increased by coadministration with substrates or inhibitors of CYP2C19, such as fluconazole, cimetidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, tenioposide and tolbutamide. No interaction was observed with omeprazole.

                                    The AUC of propafenone is increased by more than 200% by coadministration of propranolol. 
                                     The metabolism of propranolol is reduced by coadministration of quinidine, leading to a 2- to 3-fold increased blood concentration and greater degrees of clinical beta-blockade. 
                                     The metabolism of lidocaine is inhibited by coadministration of propranolol, resulting in a 25% increase in lidocaine concentrations.

                                    The mean Cmax and AUC of propranolol are increased respectively, by 50% and 30% by coadministration of nisoldipine and by 80% and 47%, by coadministration of nicardipine. 
                                     The mean Cmax and AUC of nifedipine are increased by 64% and 79%, respectively, by coadministration of propranolol. 
                                     Propranolol does not affect the pharmacokinetics of verapamil and norverapamil. Verapamil does not affect the pharmacokinetics of propranolol.

                                    Propranolol can inhibit the metabolism of diazepam, resulting in increased concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites. Diazepam does not alter the pharmacokinetics of propranolol. 
                                     The pharmacokinetics of oxazepam, triazolam, lorazepam and alprazolam are not affected by coadministration of propranolol.

                                    Coadministration of long-acting propranolol at doses greater than or equal to 160 mg/day resulted in increased thioridazine plasma concentrations ranging from 55% to 369% and increased thioridazine metabolite (mesoridazine) concentrations ranging from 33% to 209%.
                                     Coadministration of chlorpromazine with propranolol resulted in a 70% increase in propranolol plasma level.

                                    Coadministration of propranolol with cimetidine, a non-specific CYP450 inhibitor, increased propranolol AUC and Cmax by 46% and 35%, respectively. Coadministration with aluminum hydroxide gel (1200 mg) may result in a decrease in propranolol concentrations. 
                                     Coadministration of metoclopramide with the long-acting propranolol did not have a significant effect on propranolol’s pharmacokinetics.

                                    Coadministration of cholestyramine or colestipol with propranolol resulted in up to 50% decrease in propranolol concentrations. 
                                     Coadministration of propranolol with lovastatin or pravastatin, decreased 18% to 23% the AUC of both, but did not alter their pharmacodynamics. Propranolol did not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin.
