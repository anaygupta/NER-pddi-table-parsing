                           Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1)
                           Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2)
                           May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (7.3)
                           May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.4)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy
                     
                        Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants
                     
                        There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including PROTONIX, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability
                     
                        Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 False Positive Urine Tests for THC
                     
                        There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.
