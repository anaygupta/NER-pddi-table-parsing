                        Luliconazole is the R enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The potential for inter-conversion between R and S enantiomers in humans has not been assessed. Information on the pharmacokinetics of luliconazole presented below refers to both R enantiomer and S enantiomer, if any, combined.
                        Luliconazole is >99% protein bound in plasma.
                        In a pharmacokinetic trial, 12 subjects with moderate to severe tinea pedis and 8 subjects with moderate to severe tinea cruris applied a mean daily amount of approximately 3.5 grams of LUZU Cream, 1% to the affected and surrounding areas once daily for 15 days. Plasma concentrations of luliconazole on Day 15 were measurable in all subjects and fluctuated little during the 24 hour interval. In subjects with tinea pedis, the mean ± SD of the maximum concentration (Cmax) was 0.40 ± 0.76 ng/mL after the first dose and 0.93 ± 1.23 ng/mL after the final dose. The mean time to reach Cmax (Tmax) was 16.9 ± 9.39 hours after the first dose and 5.8 ± 7.61 hours after the final dose. Exposure to luliconazole, as expressed by area under the concentration time curve (AUC0–24 was 6.88 ± 14.50 ng*hr/mL after the first dose and 18.74 ± 27.05 ng*hr/mL after the final dose. In subjects with tinea cruris, the mean ± SD Cmax was 4.91 ± 2.51 ng/mL after the first dose and 7.36 ± 2.66 ng/mL after the final dose. The mean Tmax was 21.0 ± 5.55 hours after the first dose and 6.5 ± 8.25 hours after the final dose. Exposure to luliconazole, as expressed by AUC0–24 was 85.1 ± 43.69 ng*hr/mL after the first dose and 121.74 ± 53.36 ng*hr/mL after the final dose.

                           Mechanism of Action
                           
                              Luliconazole is an antifungal that belongs to the azole class. Although the exact mechanism of action against dermatophytes is unknown, luliconazole appears to inhibit ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol demethylase. Inhibition of this enzyme’s activity by azoles results in decreased amounts of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, and a corresponding accumulation of lanosterol.

                              To date, a mechanism of resistance to luliconazole has not been described.
                              LUZU Cream, 1% has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following fungi, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section:
