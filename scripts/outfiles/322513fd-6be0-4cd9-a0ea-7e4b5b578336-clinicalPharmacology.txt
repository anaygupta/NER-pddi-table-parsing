                     Mechanism of Action
                  
                  Tramadol hydrochloride is a centrally 
acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely 
understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear 
applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to µ-opioid receptors and weak 
inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.
                  Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding 
of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated 
metabolite M1 to µ-opioid receptors. In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more 
potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in 
µ-opioid binding. Tramadol-induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by 
the opiate antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative 
contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the 
plasma concentrations of each compound.
                  Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of 
norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some 
other opioid analgesics. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the 
overall analgesic profile of tramadol. The relationship between exposure of 
tramadol and M1 and efficacy has not been evaluated in the tramadol 
hydrochloride ER tablets clinical studies. 
                  Apart from analgesia, tramadol administration may 
produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, 
constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids. In 
contrast to morphine, tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At 
therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular 
function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.Pharmacokinetics 
The analgesic activity of tramadol is due to both 
parent drug and the M1 metabolite. Tramadol hydrochloride ER tablet is 
administered as a racemate and both the [-] and [+] forms of both tramadol and 
M1 are detected in the circulation.
                  The pharmacokinetics of tramadol hydrochloride ER 
tablets are approximately dose-proportional over a 100 to 400 mg dose range in 
healthy subjects. The observed tramadol AUC values for the 400 mg dose were 26% 
higher than predicted based on the AUC values for the 200 mg dose. The clinical 
significance of this finding has not been studied and is not known.
                  
                     Absorption
                  
                  In healthy subjects, the bioavailability of a 
tramadol hydrochloride ER 200 mg tablet relative to a 50 mg every six hours 
dosing regimen of the immediate-release dosage form (tramadol hydrochloride) was 
approximately 85 to 90%. Consistent with the extended-release nature of the 
formulation, there is a lag time in drug absorption following tramadol 
hydrochloride ER tablets administration. The mean peak plasma concentrations of 
tramadol and M1 after administration of tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets to 
healthy volunteers are attained at about 12 hours and 15 hours, respectively, 
after dosing (see Table 1 and Figure 2). Following administration of the 
tramadol hydrochloride ER tablet, steady-state plasma concentrations of both 
tramadol and M1 are achieved within four days with once daily dosing.
                  The mean (%CV) pharmacokinetic parameter values for 
tramadol hydrochloride ER tablet 200 mg administered once daily and tramadol 
hydrochloride immediate-release 50 mg administered every six hours are provided 
in Table 1.

                        Food Effects
                     
                  
                  After a single dose administration of 200 mg tramadol 
hydrochloride ER tablet with a high fat meal, the C max 
and AUC0-∞ of tramadol decreased 28% and 16%, 
respectively, compared to fasting conditions. Mean Tmax 
was increased by 3 hour (from 14 hour under fasting conditions to 17 hour under 
fed conditions). While tramadol hydrochloride ER tablet may be taken without 
regard to food, it is recommended that it be taken in a consistent manner. 

                  
                     Distribution
                  
                  The volume of distribution of tramadol was 2.6 and 
2.9 liters/kg in male and female subjects, respectively, following a 100 mg 
intravenous dose. The binding of tramadol to human plasma proteins is 
approximately 20% and binding also appears to be independent of concentration up 
to 10 mcg/mL. Saturation of plasma protein binding occurs only at concentrations 
outside the clinically relevant range.
                  
                     Metabolism
                  
                  Tramadol is extensively metabolized after oral 
administration. The major metabolic pathways appear to be N – (mediated by 
CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) and O – (mediated by CYP2D6) demethylation and 
glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver. One metabolite (O-desmethyl tramadol, 
denoted M1) is pharmacologically active in animal models. Formation of M1 is 
dependent on CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition, which may affect the 
therapeutic response (see PRECAUTIONS - 
Drug Interactions). 
                  
                     Elimination
                  
                  Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism 
by the liver and the metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. 
Approximately 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, 
whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites. The remainder is excreted 
either as unidentified or as unextractable metabolites. The mean terminal plasma 
elimination half-lives of racemic tramadol and racemic M1 after administration 
of tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets are approximately 7.9 and 8.8 hours, 
respectively.Special Populations 
                     Renal
                  
                  Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate 
and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. The 
pharmacokinetics of tramadol were studied in patients with mild or moderate 
renal impairment after receiving multiple doses of tramadol hydrochloride ER 
tablets 100 mg. There is no consistent trend observed for tramadol exposure 
related to renal function in patients with mild (CLcr: 50 to 80 mL/min) or 
moderate (CLcr: 30 to 50 mL/min) renal impairment in comparison to patients with 
normal renal function. However, exposure of M1 increased 20 to 40% with 
increased severity of the renal impairment (from normal to mild and moderate). 
Tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets have not been studied in patients with severe 
renal impairment (CLcr  30 mL/min). The limited availability of dose strengths 
of tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets does not permit the dosing flexibility 
required for safe use in patients with severe renal impairment. Therefore, 
tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets should not be used in patients with severe 
renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS - Use 
in Renal and Hepatic Disease and DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION). The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4 
hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose. 
                  
                     Hepatic
                  
                  Pharmacokinetics of tramadol was studied in patients 
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment after receiving multiple doses of 
tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets 100 mg. The exposure of plus  minus and minus 
minus tramadol was similar in mild and moderate hepatic impairment patients in 
comparison to patients with normal hepatic function. However, exposure of  and 
­M1 decreased 50% with increased severity of the hepatic impairment (from normal 
to mild and moderate). The pharmacokinetics of tramadol after the administration 
of tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets has not been studied in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment. After the administration of tramadol 
immediate-release tablets to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, 
tramadol area under the plasma concentration time curve was larger and the 
tramadol and M1 half-lives were longer than subjects with normal hepatic 
function. The limited availability of dose strengths of tramadol hydrochloride 
ER tablets does not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, tramadol hydrochloride ER 
tablets should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS - Use in Renal and Hepatic 
Disease and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 
                  
                     Geriatric
                  
                  The effect of age on the absorption of tramadol from 
tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets in patients over the age of 65 years has not 
been studied and is unknown (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 
                  
                     Gender
                  
                  Based on pooled multiple-dose pharmacokinetics 
studies for tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets in 166 healthy subjects (111 males 
and 55 females), the dose-normalized AUC values for tramadol were somewhat 
higher in females than in males. There was a considerable degree of overlap in 
values between male and female groups. Dosage adjustment based on gender is not 
recommended.Drug Interactions 
The formation of the active metabolite, M1, is 
mediated by CYP2D6. Approximately 7% of the population has reduced activity of 
the CYP2D6 isoenzyme of cytochrome P-450. Based on a population PK analysis of 
Phase I studies with immediate-release tablets in healthy subjects, 
concentrations of tramadol were approximately 20% higher in "poor metabolizers" 
versus "extensive metabolizers," while M1 concentrations were 40% lower. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes 
indicate that inhibitors of CYP2D6 (fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, amitriptyline, 
and quinidine) inhibit the metabolism of tramadol to various degrees, suggesting 
that concomitant administration of these compounds could result in increases in 
tramadol concentrations and decreased concentrations of M1. The full 
pharmacological impact of these alterations in terms of either efficacy or 
safety is unknown. 
                  Tramadol is also metabolized by CYP3A4. 
Administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, or 
inducers, such as rifampin and St. John’s Wort, with tramadol hydrochloride ER 
tablets may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to altered tramadol 
exposure (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug 
Interactions). 
                  
                     Quinidine
                  
                  Tramadol is metabolized to M1 by CYP2D6. A study was 
conducted to examine the effect of quinidine, a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6, 
on the pharmacokinetics of tramadol by administering 200 mg quinidine two hours 
before the administration of tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets 100 mg. The 
results demonstrated that the exposure of tramadol increased 50 to 60% and the 
exposure of M1 decreased 50 to 60% (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions). In 
vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol 
has no effect on quinidine metabolism.
                  
                     Carbamazepine
                  
                  Carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, increases tramadol 
metabolism. Patients taking carbamazepine may have a significantly reduced 
analgesic effect of tramadol. Because of the seizure risk associated with 
tramadol, concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets and 
carbamazepine is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions). 
                  
                     Cimetidine
                  
                  Concomitant administration of tramadol 
immediate-release tablets with cimetidine does not result in clinically 
significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics. No alteration of the tramadol 
hydrochloride ER tablets dosage regimen with cimetidine is recommended.
