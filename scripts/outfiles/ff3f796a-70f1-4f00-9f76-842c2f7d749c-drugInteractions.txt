                  Risedronate is not metabolized and does not induce or inhibit hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes (for example, Cytochrome P450). 
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 blockers, magnesium-based supplements or laxatives, and iron preparations interfere with the absorption of risedronate sodium delayed-release tablets (7.1, 7.2) 
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids
                     
                        When risedronate sodium delayed-release tablets were administered following breakfast, the coadministration of a tablet containing 600 mg of elemental calcium and 400 international units vitamin D reduced risedronate bioavailability by approximately 38% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Calcium supplements, antacids, magnesium-based supplements or laxatives, and iron preparations interfere with the absorption of risedronate sodium delayed-release tablets and should not be taken together.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Histamine 2 (H2) Blockers and Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) 
                     
                        Drugs that raise stomach pH (for example, PPIs or H2 blockers) may cause faster drug release from enteric coated (delayed-release) drug products such as risedronate sodium delayed-release tablets. Coadministration of risedronate sodium delayed-release tablets with the PPI, esomeprazole, increased risedronate bioavailability. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration (AUC) were increased by 60 percent and 22 percent, respectively.
                        Concomitant administration of risedronate sodium delayed-release tablets and H2 blockers or PPIs is not recommended.

                        Concomitant use of risedronate sodium delayed-release tablets with estrogens and estrogen agonist/antagonists has not been studied.

                        In the Phase 3 study comparing risedronate sodium delayed-release tablet, 35 mg once-a-week immediately following breakfast and risedronate sodium 5 mg daily, 18% of NSAID users (any use) in both groups developed upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Among non-users, 13% of patients taking risedronate sodium delayed-release tablet, 35 mg once-a-week immediately following breakfast developed upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions, compared to 12% taking risedronate sodium 5 mg daily.
