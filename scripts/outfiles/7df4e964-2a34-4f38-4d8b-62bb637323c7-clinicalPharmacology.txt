                  Meperidine hydrochloride is a narcotic analgesic with multiple
actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine; the most prominent of
these involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle.
The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation.
                  There
is some evidence which suggests that meperidine may produce less smooth muscle
spasm, constipation, and depression of the cough reflex than equianalgesic
doses of morphine. Meperidine, in 60 mg to 80 mg parenteral doses, is approximately
equivalent in analgesic effect to 10 mg of morphine. The onset of action is
slightly more rapid than with morphine, and the duration of action is slightly
shorter. Meperidine is significantly less effective by the oral than by the
parenteral route, but the exact ratio of oral to parenteral effectiveness
is unknown.
                  Meperidine is metabolized through biotransformation.
The elimination half-life is 3 to 8 hours in healthy volunteers and is 1.3
to 2 times greater in post-operative or cirrhotic patients. The only bioactive
metabolite is normeperidine which has an average elimination half-life of
20.6 hours. Elevated serum levels have been reported to cause central nervous
system excitatory effects.
