                        Concurrent and/or sequential use of BETHKIS with other drugs with neurotoxic or ototoxic potential should be avoided. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Ethacrynic Acid, Furosemide, Urea, or Mannitol
                     
                        Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue.  Therefore, BETHKIS should not be administered concomitantly with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or mannitol.
