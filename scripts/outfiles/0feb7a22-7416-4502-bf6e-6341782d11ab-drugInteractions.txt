                           Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with alpha adrenergic antagonists, including alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.4, 7.4)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                     
                        Alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated for use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir, since alfuzosin blood levels are increased. [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Alpha Adrenergic Antagonists
                     
                        The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and other alpha adrenergic antagonists have not been determined. However, interactions may be expected, and alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic antagonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Antihypertensive Medication and Nitrates
                     
                        There may be an increased risk of hypotension/postural hypotension and syncope when taking alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets  concomitantly with anti-hypertensive medication and nitrates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 PDE5 Inhibitors
                     
                        Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic antagonists agents, including alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha adrenergic antagonists and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
