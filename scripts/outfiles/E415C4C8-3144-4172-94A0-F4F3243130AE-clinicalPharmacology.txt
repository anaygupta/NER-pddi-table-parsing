Mechanism of Action
Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X
                                    receptor subtypes (RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ).
                                    RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such
                                    as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid
                                    receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors
                                    (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as
                                    transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that
                                    control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene
                                    inhibits the growth in
                                    vitro of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and
                                    squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression in vivo in some animal models.

Pharmacokinetics





General
Plasma concentrations of bexarotene were
                                            determined during clinical studies in patients with CTCL
                                            or following repeated single or multiple-daily dose
                                            applications of Targretin® gel 1%
                                            for up to 132 weeks. Plasma bexarotene concentrations
                                            were generally less than 5 ng/mL and did not exceed 55
                                            ng/mL. However, only two patients with very intense
                                            dosing regimens (> 40% BSA lesions and QID

Metabolism
Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified
                                            in plasma following oral administration of bexarotene:
                                            6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and
                                            7-oxo-bexarotene. In

                                            is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation
                                            of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative
                                            metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative
                                            metabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor

Elimination
The renal elimination of bexarotene and its
                                            metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2
                                            diabetes mellitus following oral administration of
                                            bexarotene. Neither bexarotene nor its metabolites were
                                            excreted in urine in appreciable amounts.

                                    patients had been exposed to a median of 3 prior therapies
                                    (range 2-7). All patients failed at least two treatments; the
                                    majority (68%) of patients were either refractory to two or more
                                    therapies, or were refractory to one therapy and intolerant to
                                    at least one therapy.Patients were treated with Targretin®
                                    gel 1% for a planned 16-week period with an option to continue

                                    provided that no unacceptable toxicity was occurring.Tumor response was assessed in the multicenter study by
                                    observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a
                                    Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This
                                    endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index
                                    lesions, of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation,
                                    hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement.
                                    New cutaneous lesions or tumors and extracutaneous disease
                                    manifestations were not considered in response or disease
                                    progression assessments.All tumor responses required confirmation over at least
                                    two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial
                                    response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the
                                    index lesions. A complete clinical response required complete
                                    disappearance of the index lesions, but did not require
                                    confirmation by biopsy.Targretin® gel produced an overall
                                    response rate of 26% (13/50) with a corresponding exact 95%
                                    confidence interval from 14.6% to 40.3% by the Composite
                                    Assessment of Index Lesion Severity. For the Stage IA and IB
                                    patients, the response rate was 28% (13/47) with a corresponding
                                    exact 95% confidence interval from 15.6% to 42.6%. For the Stage
                                    II patients the response rate was 0% (0/3). Two percent of
                                    patients (1/50) had a clinical complete response. The median
                                    time to best response on the Composite Assessment of Index
                                    Lesion Severity (n=13) was 85 days (range: 36-154).® gel produced an overall
                                    response rate of 26% (13/50) with a corresponding exact 95%
                                    confidence interval from 14.6% to 40.3% by the Composite

                                    patients, the response rate was 28% (13/47) with a corresponding
                                    exact 95% confidence interval from 15.6% to 42.6%. For the Stage
                                    II patients the response rate was 0% (0/3). Two percent of
                                    patients (1/50) had a clinical complete response. The median
                                    time to best response on the Composite Assessment of Index
                                    Lesion Severity (n=13) was 85 days (range: 36-154).The rate of relapse in responding patients by the
                                    Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity was 23% (3/13)                                    over a median observation period of 149 days (range 56-342).
                                    Fourteen patients developed new lesions in untreated areas
                                    (14/50; 28%). Four patients developed clinically abnormal lymph
                                    nodes (≥ 1cm diam) (4/50; 8%). One patient developed a
                                    cutaneous tumor (1/50; 2%).The Phase I-II program (dose-seeking trials with
                                    different response criteria than the multicenter trial) was
                                    supportive of the multicenter study results.
