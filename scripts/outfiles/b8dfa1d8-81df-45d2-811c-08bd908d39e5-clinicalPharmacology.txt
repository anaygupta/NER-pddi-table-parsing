                  Although the precise mechanism of action of hydralazine is not 
fully understood, the major effects are on the cardiovascular system. 
Hydralazine apparently lowers blood pressure by exerting a peripheral 
vasodilating effect through a direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. 
Hydralazine, by altering cellular calcium metabolism, interferes with the 
calcium movements within the vascular smooth muscle that are responsible for 
initiating or maintaining the contractile state.
                  The peripheral vasodilating effect of hydralazine results in decreased 
arterial blood pressure (diastolic more than systolic); decreased peripheral 
vascular resistance; and an increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac 
output. The preferential dilatation of arterioles, as compared to veins, 
minimizes postural hypotension and promotes the increase in cardiac output. 
Hydralazine usually increases renin activity in plasma, presumably as a result 
of increased secretion of renin by the renal juxtaglomerular cells in response 
to reflex sympathetic discharge. This increase in renin activity leads to the 
production of angiotensin II, which then causes stimulation of aldosterone and 
consequent sodium reabsorption. Hydralazine also maintains or increases renal 
and cerebral blood flow.
                  Hydralazine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, and peak plasma 
levels are reached at 1 to 2 hours. Plasma levels of apparent hydralazine 
decline with a half-life of 3 to 7 hours. Binding to human plasma protein is 
87%. Plasma levels of hydralazine vary widely among individuals. Hydralazine is 
subject to polymorphic acetylation; slow acetylators generally have higher 
plasma levels of hydralazine and require lower doses to maintain control of 
blood pressure. Hydralazine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism; it is 
excreted mainly in the form of metabolites in the urine.
