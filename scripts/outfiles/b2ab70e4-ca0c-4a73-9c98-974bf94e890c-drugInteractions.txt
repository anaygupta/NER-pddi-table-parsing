                           Interactions with Other CNS Agents
                           
                              Concurrent use of levorphanol with all central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, other opioids, general anesthetics, barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants and antihistamines) may result in additive central nervous system depressant effects. Respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may occur. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. Although no interaction between MAO inhibitors and levorphanol has been observed, it is not recommended for use with MAO inhibitors.
                              Most cases of serious or fatal adverse events involving levorphanol reported to the manufacturer or the FDA have involved either the administration of large initial doses of the drug or too frequent doses of the drug to non-opioid tolerant patients, or the simultaneous administration of levorphanol with other drugs affecting respiration (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE and WARNINGS). The initial dose of levorphanol should be reduced by approximately 50% or more when it is given to patients along with another drug affecting respiration.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics
                           
                              Agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as levorphanol. In opioid-dependent patients, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.
