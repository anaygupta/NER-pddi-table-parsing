                        Efficacy of DIDREX Tablets in combination with other anorectic agents has not been studied and the combined use may have the potential for serious cardiac problems.
                        Hypertensive crises have resulted when sympathomimetic amines have been used concomitantly or within 14 days following use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. DIDREX should not be used concomitantly with other CNS stimulants.
                        Amphetamines may decrease the hypotensive effect of antihypertensives. Amphetamines may enhance the effects of tricyclic antidepressants.
                        Urinary alkalinizing agents increase blood levels and decrease excretion of amphetamines. Urinary acidifying agents decrease blood levels and increase excretion of amphetamines.
