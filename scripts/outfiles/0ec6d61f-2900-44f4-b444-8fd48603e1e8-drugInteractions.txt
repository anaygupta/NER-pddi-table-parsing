                           Ergot-Containing Drugs
                        
                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24Â hours of each other should be avoided (see ).
                                    CONTRAINDICATIONS
                        
                        
                           Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors
                        
                        MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see and ).
