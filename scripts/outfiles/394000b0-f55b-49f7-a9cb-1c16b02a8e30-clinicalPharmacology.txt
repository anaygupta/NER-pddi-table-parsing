                        NAFTIN Cream is a topical antifungal drug [see Clinical Pharmacology(12.4)]

                        The pharmacodynamics of NAFTIN Cream have not been established.
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        
                           In vitro and in vivo bioavailability studies have demonstrated that naftifine penetrates the stratum corneum in sufficient concentration to inhibit the growth of dermatophytes. 
                        The pharmacokinetics of NAFTIN Cream was evaluated following once-daily topical application for 2 weeks to twenty one adult subjects, both males and females, with both tinea pedis and tinea cruris. The median total amount of cream applied was 6.4 g (range 5.3-7.5 g) per day. The results showed that the systemic exposure (i.e., maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC)) to naftifine increased over the 2 week treatment period in all the 21 subjects. Geometric Mean (CV%) AUC0-24 was 117 (41.2) ng*hr/mL on Day 1, and 204 (28.5) ng*hr/mL on Day 14. Geometric Mean (CV %) Cmax was 7 ng/mL (55.6) on Day 1 and 11 ng/mL (29.3) on day 14. Median Tmax was 8.0 hours on Day 1 (range: 4 to 24) and 6.0 hours on Day 14 (range: 0 to 16). Accumulation after 14 days of topical application was less than two fold. Trough concentrations generally increased throughout the 14 day study period. Naftifine continued to be detected in plasma in 13/21 (62%) subjects on day 28, the mean (SD) plasma concentrations were 1.6 ± 0.5 ng/mL (range below limit of quantitation (BLQ) to 3 ng/mL). 
                        In the same pharmacokinetic trial conducted in patients with tinea pedis and tinea cruris, median fraction of the dose excreted in urine during the treatment period was 0.0016% on Day 1 versus 0.0020% on Day 14. 
                        In a second trial, that enrolled 22 subjects the pharmacokinetics of NAFTIN Cream was evaluated in 20 pediatric subjects 13 – 17 years of age with both tinea pedis and tinea cruris. Subjects were treated with a median dose of 8.1 g (range 6.6-10.1 g) applied to the affected areas once daily for 14 days. The results showed that the systemic exposure increased over the treatment period. Geometric Mean (CV%) AUC0-24 was 138 (50.2) ng*hr/mL on Day 1, and 192 (74.9) ng*hr/mL on Day 14. Geometric Mean (CV %) Cmax was 9.21 ng/mL (48.4) on Day 1 and 12.7 ng/mL (67.2) on day 14. Median fraction of the dose excreted in urine during the treatment period was 0.0030% on Day 1 and 0.0033% on Day 14.

                        Although the exact mechanism of action against fungi is not known, naftifine hydrochloride appears to interfere with sterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzyme squalene 2, 3-epoxidase.This inhibition of enzyme activity results in decreased amounts of sterols, especially ergosterol, and a corresponding accumulation of squalene in the cells.

                              To date, a mechanism of resistance to naftifine has not been identified.
                              Naftifine has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following fungi, both in vitro and in clinical infections, as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section:
