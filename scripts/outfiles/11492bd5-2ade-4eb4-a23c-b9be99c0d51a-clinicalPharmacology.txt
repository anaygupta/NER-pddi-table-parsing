                  Mebrofenin is an iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) derivative with no known pharmacologic action at the recommended doses.
                  Following intravenous administration in normal subjects, Technetium Tc 99m Mebrofenin was rapidly cleared from the circulation. The mean percent injected dose remaining in the blood at 10 minutes was 17%. The injected activity was cleared through the hepatobiliary system with visualization of the liver by 5 minutes and maximum liver uptake occurring at 11 minutes post-injection. Hepatic duct and gallbladder visualization occurred by 10 to 15 minutes and intestinal activity was visualized by 30 to 60 minutes in subjects with normal hepatobiliary function. The mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during the first 3 hours was 1% (0.4 to 2.0%).
                  Elevated serum bilirubin levels increase renal excretion of Tc 99m HIDA agents. In two studies in which Tc 99m Mebrofenin was administered to patients having mean elevated serum bilirubin levels of 9.8 mg/dL (1.7 to 46.3 mg/dL), the mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during the first 3 hours was 3% (0.2 to 11.5%). The mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during 3-24 hours was 14.9% (0.4 to 34.8%).
                  In jaundiced patients, the percent injected dose remaining in the blood at 10 minutes may be twice as high or more than the level in normals. Hepatobiliary transit may be delayed and visualization times increased. As a consequence, the quality of the images obtained frequently diminishes.
