                  As with other dialysis solutions, blood concentrations of dialyzable drugs may be reduced by dialysis. Dosage adjustment of concomitant medications may be necessary. In patients using cardiac glycosides (digoxin and others), plasma levels of calcium, potassium and magnesium must be carefully monitored [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].
                  
                  
                     Insulin: Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes may require modification of insulin dosage following initiation of treatment with EXTRANEAL. Monitor blood glucose and adjust insulin, if needed [see Boxed Warning].
