                  Codeine Phosphate is a centrally acting analgesic and antitussive which is well absorbed orally. Following absorption, codeine is metabolized by the liver and metabolic products are excreted in the urine.
                  Phenylephrine Hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic that acts predominantly on alpha receptors and has little action on beta receptors. Phylephrine Hydrochloride causes constriction of blood vessels, which shrinks swollen mucous membranes, reduces tissue hyperemia edema, nasal congestion and increases nasal airway patency. It, therefore, functions as an oral nasal decongestant while causing minimal central nervous system stimulation.
                  Pyrilamine Maleate is an antihistamine used in suppressing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. However, it is more prone to cause drowsiness than some other antihistamines.
