                  The exact mechanism by which erythromycin reduces lesions of acne 
vulgaris is not fully known; however, the effect appears to be due in part to 
the antibacterial activity of the drug.
                  Benzoyl peroxide has a keratolytic and desquamative effect which may also 
contribute to its efficacy. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by 
the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid.
