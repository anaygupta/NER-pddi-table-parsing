Clinical Pharmacology
A wide range of antibacterial action is provided by the
overlapping spectra of neomycin, polymyxin B sulfate, and bacitracin.Neomycin
is bactericidal for many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It is
an aminoglycoside antibiotic which inhibits protein synthesis by binding with
ribosomal RNA and causing misreading of the bacterial genetic code.Polymyxin
B is bactericidal for a variety of gram-negative organisms. It increases the
permeability of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with the phospholipid
components of the membrane.Bacitracin is bactericidal
for a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It interferes
with bacterial cell wall synthesis by inhibition of the regeneration of phospholipid
receptors involved in peptidoglycan synthesis.Microbiology:  Neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate,
and bacitracin zinc together are considered active against  the following
microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus,
streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella/Enterobacter species, Neisseria species, and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. The product does not provide adequate coverage against Serratia marcescens.Microbiology:  Neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate,
and bacitracin zinc together are considered active against  the following
