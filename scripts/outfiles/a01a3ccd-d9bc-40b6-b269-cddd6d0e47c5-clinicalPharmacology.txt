                        Although the exact mode of action for salicylic acid in the treatment of warts is unknown, its activity appears to be associated with its keratolytic action, which results in mechanical removal of epidermal cells infected with wart viruses.  UltraSal-ER incorporates a unique patented extended release form of salicylic acid that provides for enhanced release of salicylic acid for over 24 hours.
                        The virucidal complex incorporated into UltraSal-ERâ€™s proprietary solution is designed to help reduce risk of reinfection at the wart site, as well as prevent viral contamination of the product under normal usage.
