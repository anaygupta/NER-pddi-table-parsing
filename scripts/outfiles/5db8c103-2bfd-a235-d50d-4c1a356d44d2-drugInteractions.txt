                        Concomitant administration of a loop diuretic had no effect on the calcium-lowering action of pamidronate disodium.
                        Caution is indicated when Pamidronate disodium USP is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs.
                        In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal function deterioration may be increased when Pamidronate disodium USP is used in combination with thalidomide.
