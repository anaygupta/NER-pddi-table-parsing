                        Ribavirin has been shown in vitro to increase intracellular triphosphate levels of didanosine, which could cause or worsen clinical toxicities (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).
                        Didanosine Delayed-Release Capsules: Table 3 and  4 summarize the effects on AUC and Cmax, with a 90% confidence interval (CI) when available, following coadministration of didanosine delayed-release capsules with a variety of drugs. Clinical recommendations based on drug interaction studies for drugs in bold font are included in PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.

Didanosine Buffered Formulations: Table 5and 6  summarize the effects on AUC and Cmax, with a 90% or 95% CI when available, following coadministration of buffered formulations of didanosine with a variety of drugs. Except as noted in table footnotes, the results of these studies may be expected to apply to didanosine. For most of the listed drugs, no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were noted. Clinical recommendations based on drug interaction studies for drugs in bold font are included in PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (for tenofovir).
