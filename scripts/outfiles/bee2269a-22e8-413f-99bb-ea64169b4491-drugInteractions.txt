                                 In vitro metabolism studies showed that CYP1A2 was the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ropinirole. There is thus the potential for substrates or inhibitors of this enzyme when coadministered with ropinirole to alter its clearance. Therefore, if therapy with a drug known to be a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole hydrochloride, adjustment of the dose of ropinirole hydrochloride may be required. 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           L-dopa
                           
                              Coadministration of carbidopa + L-dopa (SINEMETÂ®
                                 110 mg/100 mg twice daily) with ropinirole (2 mg 3 times daily) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ropinirole hydrochloride (n = 28 patients). Oral administration of ropinirole 2 mg 3 times daily increased mean steady-state Cmax of L-dopa by 20%, but its AUC was unaffected (n = 23 patients).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Digoxin
                           
                              Coadministration of ropinirole hydrochloride (2 mg 3 times daily) with digoxin (0.125 mg to 0.25 mg once daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin in ten patients.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Theophylline
                           
                              Administration of theophylline (300 mg twice daily, a substrate of CYP1A2) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ropinirole (2 mg 3 times daily) in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease. Ropinirole (2 mg 3 times daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (5 mg/kg IV) in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Ciprofloxacin
                           
                              Coadministration of ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily), an inhibitor of CYP1A2, with ropinirole (2 mg 3 times daily) increased ropinirole AUC by 84% on average and Cmax by 60% (n = 12 patients).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Estrogens
                           
                              Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that estrogens (mainly ethinylestradiol: intake 0.6 mg to 3 mg over 4 month to 23 year period) reduced the oral clearance of ropinirole by 36% in 16 patients. Dosage adjustment may not be needed for ropinirole hydrochloride in patients on estrogen therapy because patients must be carefully titrated with ropinirole to tolerance or adequate effect. However, if estrogen therapy is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole hydrochloride, then adjustment of the dose of ropinirole hydrochloride may be required.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Dopamine Antagonists
                           
                              Since ropinirole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists such as neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide may diminish the effectiveness of ropinirole hydrochloride. Patients with major psychotic disorders treated with neuroleptics should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. 
                              Population analysis showed that commonly administered drugs, e.g., selegiline, amantadine, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, ibuprofen, thiazides, antihistamines, and anticholinergics, did not affect the oral clearance of ropinirole.
