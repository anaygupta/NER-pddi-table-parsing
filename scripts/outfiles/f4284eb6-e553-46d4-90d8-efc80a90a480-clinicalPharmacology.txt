                  Sterile Water for Irrigation USP is utilized for a variety of clinical indications. Because of its low refractive index (1.3325), water provides excellent visibility during endoscopic urological procedures. It is also utilized as a pharmaceutic aid, as well as in the preparation of enteral nutrient products.
                  Water is hypotonic and will cause hemolysis and will be readily absorbed by the tissues during surgical procedures; therefore, its use under such conditions is not recommended.
