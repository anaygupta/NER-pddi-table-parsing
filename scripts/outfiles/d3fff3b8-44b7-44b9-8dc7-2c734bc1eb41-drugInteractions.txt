                     Antiepileptic drugs (AED): The AED class including, but not limited to, phenytoin, carbamazepine, primidone, valproic acid, fosphenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital
and lamotrigine have been shown to impair folate absorption and increase the metabolism of circulating folate.
                     Additionally, concurrent use of folic acid has been associated with enhanced phenytoin metabolism, lowering the level of the AED in the blood and allowing
breakthrough seizures to occur. Caution should be used when prescribing this product among patients who are receiving treatment with phenytoin and other anticonvulsants.
                     Capecitabine: Folinic acid (5-formyltetrahydrofolate) may increase the toxicity of capecitabine.
                     Cholestyramine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.
                     Colestipol: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.
                     Cycloserine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.
                     Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitors (DHFRI): DHFRIs block the conversion of folic acid to its active forms, and lower plasma and red blood cell folate levels. DHFRIs include aminopterin, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, triamterene, and trimethoprim. 
                     Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine exerts a noncompetitive inhibition of the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate active transport in the intestine.
                     Isotretinoin: Reduced folate levels have occurred in some patients taking isotretinoin.
                     L-dopa, triamterene, colchicine, and trimethoprim may decrease plasma folate levels.
                     Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit some folate dependent enzymes in laboratory experiments.
                     NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin and sulindac.
                     Oral Contraceptives: Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy.
                     Methylprednisolone: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted after treatment with methylprednisolone.
                     Pancreatic Enzymes: Reduced folate levels have occurred in some patients taking pancreatic extracts, such as pancreatin and pancrelipase.
                     Pentamidine: Reduced folate levels have been seen with prolonged intravenous pentamidine.
                     Pyrimethamine: High levels of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of pyrimethamine.
                     Smoking and Alcohol: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted.
                     Sulfasalazine: Inhibits the absorption and metabolism of folic acid.
                     Metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes decreases serum folate.
                     Warfarin can produce significant impairment in folate status after a 6-month therapy.
                     Heme-iron: Can compete for transport and reduce folate absorption. Ensure adequate medical supervision to ensure proper iron levels.
                     Folinic acid may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil.
                     Concurrent administration of chloramphenicol and folinic acid in folate-deficient patients may result in antagonism of the haematopoietic response to folate.
							
                     Caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of folinic acid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection as it is associated with increased rates of treatment failure and mortality in a placebo controlled study. 
                  
                  **Folate is a broad term that includes folic acid and all reduced forms including l-methylfolate and folinic acid. VP-HEME OB + DHA does not contain l-methylfolate or folinic acid but these warnings are included as general folate information. 
                  Drugs which interact with vitamin B12:
                  
                     Antibiotics, cholestyramine, colchicines, colestipol, metformin, para-aminosalicylic acid, and potassium chloride may decrease the absorption of vitamin B12.
                     Nitrous oxide can produce a functional vitamin B12 deficiency.
                  
                  Drugs which interact with vitamin B6:
                  
                     Vitamin B6 should not be given to patients receiving the drug levodopa because the action of levodopa is antagonized by vitamin B6. However, vitamin B6 may be used concurrently in patients receiving a preparation containing both carbidopa and levodopa.
                     Isoniazid can produce a vitamin B6 deficiency. 
                  
                  	Drugs which may interact with vitamin D3:
                  
                     Certain thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide, as well as antacids, bile acid sequestrants (such as cholestyramine), mineral oil, orlistat, olestra, cimetidine, and anticonvulsant medications may reduce the absorption or increase the catabolism of vitamin D.
                     Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. 
                  
                  Drugs which may interact with zinc:
                  
                     Concomitant administration of zinc supplements and certain antibiotics, specifically tetracyclines and quinolones, may decrease absorption of the antibiotic and
potentially reduce its efficacy.
