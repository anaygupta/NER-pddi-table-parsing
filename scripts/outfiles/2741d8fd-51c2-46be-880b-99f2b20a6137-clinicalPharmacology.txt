                  The principal action of pralidoxime chloride is to reactivate cholinesterase (mainly outside of the central nervous system) which has been inactivated by phosphorylation due to an organophosphate pesticide or related compound. The destruction of accumulated acetylcholine can then proceed, and neuromuscular junctions will again function normally. Pralidoxime chloride also slows the process of “aging” of phosphorylated cholinesterase to a nonreactivatable form, and detoxifies certain organophosphates by direct chemical reaction. The drug has its most critical effect in relieving paralysis of the muscles of respiration. Because pralidoxime chloride is less effective in relieving depression of the respiratory center, atropine is always required concomitantly to block the effect of accumulated acetylcholine at this site. Pralidoxime chloride relieves muscarinic signs and symptoms, salivation, bronchospasm, etc., but this action is relatively unimportant since atropine is adequate for this purpose.
                  PROTOPAM Chloride has been studied in animals as an antidote against numerous organophosphate pesticides, chemicals, and drugs (see Animal Pharmacology and Toxicology). Regardless of whether or not animal studies suggest that the organophosphate poison to which a particular  patient has been exposed is amenable to treatment with pralidoxime chloride, the use of pralidoxime chloride should, nevertheless, be considered in any life-threatening situation resulting from poisoning by these compounds, since the limited and arbitrary conditions of pharmacologic screening do not always accurately reflect the usefulness of pralidoxime chloride in the clinical situation.
