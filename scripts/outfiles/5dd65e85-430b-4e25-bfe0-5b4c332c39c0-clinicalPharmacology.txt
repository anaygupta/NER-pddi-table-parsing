                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The mechanism of action of quetiapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of quetiapine in schizophrenia and its mood stabilizing properties in bipolar depression and mania are mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D ) and serotonin type 2 (5HT ) antagonism.  Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of quetiapine.

                        Quetiapine’s antagonism of histamine H receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug.

                        Quetiapine is an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain: serotonin 5HT and 5HT (IC =717 & 148nM, respectively), dopamine D and D (IC =1268 & 329nM, respectively), histamine H (IC =30nM), and adrenergic α and α receptors (IC =94 & 271nM, respectively).  Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors (IC >5000 nM).

                        Quetiapine fumarate activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are dose-proportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and quetiapine accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing.  Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of about 6 hours within the proposed clinical dose range.  Steady-state concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing.  Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

                           Pharmacokinetic information in patients (10 to 17 years of age) is approved for
AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP’s quetiapine fumarate drug product labeling.
However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP’s marketing exclusivity rights;
this drug product is not labeled for such use in those patients.
                        
                        
                           Absorption
                        
                        Quetiapine fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours.  The tablet formulation is 100% bioavailable relative to solution.  The bioavailability of quetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with C and AUC values increased by 25% and 15%, respectively.

                        Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 10±4 L/kg.  It is 83% bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. , quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin.  In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine.

                        Following a single oral dose of C-quetiapine, less than 1% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized.  Approximately 73% and 20% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.

                        Quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver.  The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation to the sulfoxide metabolite and oxidation to the parent acid metabolite; both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. studies using human liver microsomes revealed that the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of quetiapine to its major, but inactive, sulfoxide metabolite and in the metabolism of its active metabolite N-desalkyl quetiapine.

                        Oral clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 40% in elderly patients (≥ 65 years, n=9) compared to young patients (n=12), and dosing adjustment may be necessary [see ( )].

                        There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine.

                        Smoking has no effect on the oral clearance of quetiapine.

                        Patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr=10 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m , n=8) had a 25% lower mean oral clearance than normal subjects (Clcr > 80 mL/min/1.73 m , n=8), but plasma quetiapine concentrations in the subjects with renal insufficiency were within the range of concentrations seen in normal subjects receiving the same dose.  Dosage adjustment is therefore not needed in these patients.

                        Hepatically impaired patients (n=8) had a 30% lower mean oral clearance of quetiapine than normal subjects.  In two of the 8 hepatically impaired patients, AUC and C were 3 times higher than those observed typically in healthy subjects.  Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in the hepatically impaired population, and dosage adjustment may be needed [see ( )].

                        enzyme inhibition data suggest that quetiapine and 9 of its metabolites would have little inhibitory effect on metabolism mediated by cytochromes P450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4.

                        Quetiapine oral clearance is increased by the prototype cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer, phenytoin, and decreased by the prototype cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole. Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is coadministered with phenytoin or ketoconazole [ ( )].
