                     7.1 Coumarin and Coumarin Derivatives
                     
                        The soybean oil present in Nutrilipid® 20% has vitamin K1. Vitamin K can reverse the anticoagulant activity of coumarin and coumarin derivatives, including warfarin, which work by blocking recycling of vitamin K. Monitor laboratory parameters for anticoagulant activity in patients who are on both Nutrilipid® 20% and coumarin or coumarin derivatives.
