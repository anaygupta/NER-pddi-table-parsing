                  Iodochlorhydroxyquin is a broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal. Its precise mechanism of action is unknown. Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and some evidence suggests a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man.
