                  Gentamicin sulfate is a wide spectrum antibiotic that provides highly effective topical treatment in primary and secondary bacterial infections of the skin. Gentamicin Sulfate Cream may clear infections that have not responded to treatment with other topical antibiotic agents. In primary skin infections such as impetigo contagiosa, treatment 3 or 4 times daily with Gentamicin Sulfate Cream usually clears the lesions promptly. In secondary skin infections, Gentamicin Sulfate Cream aids in the treatment of the underlying dermatoses by controlling the infection. Bacteria susceptible to the action of gentamicin sulfate include sensitive strains of Streptococci (group A beta-hemolytic, alpha-hemolytic), Staphylococcus aureus (coagulase positive, coagulase negative, and some penicillinase-producing strains), and the gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, and Kiebsiella pneumoniae.
