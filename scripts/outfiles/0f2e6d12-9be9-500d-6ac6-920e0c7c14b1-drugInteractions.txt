                           Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution (7.1).
                           Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil:  Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with mineral oil or cholestyramine (7.2,7.3).
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 CYP3A Inhibitors
                     
                        Since paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A, exposure of paricalcitol will be increased while paricalcitol is co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors including the following drugs but not limited to: ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin or voriconazole. Dose adjustment of paricalcitol capsules may be required, and iPTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Cholestyramine
                     
                        Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol capsules.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Mineral Oil
                     
                        The use of mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol capsules.
