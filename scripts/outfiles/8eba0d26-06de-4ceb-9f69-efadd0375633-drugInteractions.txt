                                    vitro studies have shown that rifaximin did
                            not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6,
                            2E1 and CYP3A4 at concentrations ranging from 2 to 200 ng/mL [see Clinical
                                    Pharmacology (12.3)]. Rifaximin is not
                            expected to inhibit these enzymes in clinical use.

                                    vitro study has suggested that rifaximin
                            induces CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  However, in
                            patients with normal liver function, rifaximin at the recommended dosing
                            regimen is not expected to induce CYP3A4.  It is unknown
                            whether rifaximin can have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics
                            of concomitant CYP3A4 substrates in patients with reduced liver function
                            who have elevated rifaximin concentrations.

                                    vitro study suggested that rifaximin is a
                            substrate of P-glycoprotein.  It is unknown whether concomitant
                            drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein can increase the systemic exposure of
                            rifaximin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
