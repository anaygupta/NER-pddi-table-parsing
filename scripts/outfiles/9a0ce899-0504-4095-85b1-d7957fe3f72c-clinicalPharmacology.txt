                  In animals, diazepam appears to act on parts of the limbic system, the thalamus 
and hypothalamus, and induces calming effects. Diazepam, unlike chlorpromazine 
and reserpine, has no demonstrable peripheral autonomic blocking action, nor 
does it produce extrapyramidal side effects; however, animals treated with 
diazepam do have a transient ataxia at higher doses. Diazepam was found to have 
transient cardiovascular depressor effects in dogs. Long-term experiments in 
rats revealed no disturbances of endocrine function. Injections into animals 
have produced localized irritation of tissue surrounding injection sites and 
some thickening of veins after intravenous use.
