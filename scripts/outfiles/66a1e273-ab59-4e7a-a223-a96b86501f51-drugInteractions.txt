                        Formal interaction studies of TNKase with other drugs
									have not been performed. Patients studied in clinical trials of
									TNKase were routinely treated with heparin and aspirin.
									Anticoagulants (such as heparin and vitamin K antagonists) and
									drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic
									acid, dipyridamole, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors) may increase the
									risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after
									TNKase therapy.
