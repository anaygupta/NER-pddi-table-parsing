                  The pharmacokinetic interaction between neostigmine methylsulfate and other drugs has not been studied.  Neostigmine methylsulfate is metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver.  Closely monitor patients for a longer period of time when using Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection with other drugs which may alter the activity of metabolizing enzymes or transporters.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Depolarizing Muscle relaxants
                     
                        Use of neostigmine to reverse the effects of depolarizing muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine is not recommended, because it may prolong the phase-1 block.   
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Antibiotics
                     
                        Certain antibiotics, particularly neomycin, streptomycin and kanamycin have nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking action, and therefore, neostigmine dose adjustments may be required to reverse neuromuscular block in patients who have been taking these drugs.  There was no effect on neostigmine action on rocuronium reversal by cefuroxime, metronidazole, cefuroxime or metronidazole.
