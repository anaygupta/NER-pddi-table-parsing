                  Pilocarpine hydrochloride is a direct acting cholinergic parasympathomimetic agent which acts through direct stimulation of muscarinic receptors and smooth muscle such as the iris and secretory glands. 
                  Pilocarpine contracts the ciliary muscle, causing increased tension on the scleral spur and opening of the trabecular meshwork spaces to facilitate outflow of aqueous humor. Outflow resistance is reduced, lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). Pilocarpine also produces miosis through contraction of the iris sphincter muscle. Miosis relieves appositional angle narrowing and closure, which lowers IOP in certain types of angle-closure glaucoma.
                  
 

                  
                  Systemic exposure to pilocarpine was evaluated in 14 healthy subjects administered 2 drops of pilocarpine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 4% to both eyes four times daily for eight days. A comparison of Cmax values on Days 5 and 8 indicated that pilocarpine concentrations in plasma reached steady-state following topical administration of Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution 4%. The mean (SD) Cmax and AUC0-last values on Day 8 were 3.7 (3.2) ng/mL and 7.7 (8.4) ngxhour/mL, respectively. The Tmax values on Day 8 ranged from 0.5 to 1 hour.
