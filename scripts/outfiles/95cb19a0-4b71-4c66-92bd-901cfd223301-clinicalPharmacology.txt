                     12.1  Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action of VANOS Cream in corticosteroid responsive dermatoses is unknown.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2  Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Vasoconstrictor studies performed with VANOS Cream in healthy subjects indicate that it is in the super-high range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids; however, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence.
                        Application of VANOS Cream twice daily for 14 days in 18 adult subjects with plaque-type psoriasis (10–50% BSA, mean 19.6% BSA) and 31 adult subjects (17 treated once daily; 14 treated twice daily) with atopic dermatitis (2–10% BSA, mean 5% BSA) showed demonstrable HPA-axis suppression in 2 subjects with psoriasis (with 12% and 25% BSA) and 1 subject with atopic dermatitis (treated once daily, 4% BSA) where the criterion for HPA-axis suppression is a serum cortisol level of less than or equal to 18 micrograms per deciliter 30 minutes after stimulation with cosyntropin (ACTH1–24) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                           ].
                          HPA-axis suppression following application of VANOS Cream, 0.1% (once or twice daily) was also evaluated in 123 pediatric patients from 3 months to < 18 years of age with atopic dermatitis (mean BSA range 34.6 % – 40.0 %). HPA-axis suppression was observed in 4 patients in the twice daily groups. Follow-up testing 14 days after treatment discontinuation demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis in all 4 suppressed patients [see 
                              Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific populations (8.4)
                           ].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.
