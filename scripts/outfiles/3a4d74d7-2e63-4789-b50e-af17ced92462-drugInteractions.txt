                        MAO inhibitors should be avoided or used with extreme caution.
                        Concurrent use of tricyclic antidepressants may decrease the antihypertensive effect of reserpine.
                        Concurrent use of reserpine and direct-or-indirect acting sympathomimetics should be closely monitored. The action of direct-acting amines (epinephrine, isoproterenol, phenylephrine, metaraminol) may be prolonged when given to patients taking reserpine. The action of indirect-acting amines (ephedrine, tyramine, amphetamines) is inhibited.
                        Reserpine should be used cautiously with digitalis and quinidine, since cardiac arrhythmias have occurred with rauwolfia preparations.
                        Concomitant use of reserpine with other antihypertensive agents necessitates careful titration of dosage with each agent.
