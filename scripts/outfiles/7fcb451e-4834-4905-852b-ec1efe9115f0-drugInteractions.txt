                  The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) [see 
                        Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) 
                     and 
                        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                     ].
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        


                        



                           Other Lipid-Lowering Medications: Use with fibrate products or lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with LIPITOR (7).
                           Digoxin: Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8).
                           Oral Contraceptives: Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9).
                           Rifampin should be simultaneously co-administered with LIPITOR (7.7).
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1  Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4
                     
                        LIPITOR is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of LIPITOR with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                     
                                      Clarithromycin: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of LIPITOR 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of LIPITOR alone [see 
                                       Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                                    ]. Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the LIPITOR dose exceeds 20 mg [see 
                                       Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)
                                     and 
                                       Dosage and Administration (2.6)

                                       Combination of Protease Inhibitors: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of LIPITOR with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir,  compared to that of LIPITOR alone [see 
                                          Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                                       ]. Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of LIPITOR should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing LIPITOR and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of LIPITOR should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution [see 
                                          Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)

                                    Itraconazole: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of LIPITOR 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg [see 
                                       Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                                    ]. Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the LIPITOR dose exceeds 20 mg [see 
                                       Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)

                           Atorvastatin and atorvastatin-metabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of LIPITOR 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mg/kg/day compared to that of LIPITOR alone [see 
                                 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                              ]. The co-administration of LIPITOR with cyclosporine should be avoided [see 
                                 Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)
                              ].

                           Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are co-administered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of LIPITOR with gemfibrozil should be avoided [see 
                                 Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                              ].

                           Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, LIPITOR should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates [see 
                                 Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                              ].

                           The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when LIPITOR is used in combination with niacin; a reduction in LIPITOR dosage should be considered in this setting [see 
                                 Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                              ].

                        Concomitant administration of LIPITOR with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous co-administration of LIPITOR with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of LIPITOR after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations.

                        When multiple doses of LIPITOR and digoxin were co-administered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.9 Oral Contraceptives
                     
                        Co-administration of LIPITOR and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           ]. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking LIPITOR.

                           Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.
