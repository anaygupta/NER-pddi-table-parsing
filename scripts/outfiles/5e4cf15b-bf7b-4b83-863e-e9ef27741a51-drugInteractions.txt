                  No formal clinical assessments of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between FOLOTYN and other drugs have been conducted.  The effect of co-administration of the uricosuric drug probenecid (an inhibitor of multiple transporter systems including the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) efflux transporter) on pralatrexate pharmacokinetics was investigated in a Phase 1 clinical study.  Co-administration of increasing doses of probenecid resulted in delayed clearance of pralatrexate and a commensurate increase in exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                  When administering FOLOTYN to patients receiving probenecid or other drugs that may affect relevant transporter systems (eg, NSAIDs), monitor patients closely for signs of systemic toxicity due to increased drug exposure.

               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Co-administration with probenecid or other drugs that may affect relevant transporter systems (eg, NSAIDs) requires close monitoring for signs of systemic toxicity.
