                        Increases in serum creatinine have occurred when Cefotetan for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP was given alone. If Cefotetan for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP and an aminoglycoside are used concomitantly, renal function should be carefully monitored, because nephrotoxicity may be potentiated.
