                  Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of 
agents and they may delay healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the bodyâ€™s 
defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be 
used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant in a 
particular case.
                  The anti-infective components in the combination are included to provide 
action against specific organisms susceptible to them. Polymyxin B sulfate and 
neomycin sulfate together are considered active against the following 
microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, 
Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella- Enterobacter species, Neisseria species, and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa. The product does not provide adequate coverage against Serratia marcescens and streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae.
                  The relative potency of corticosteroids depends on the molecular structure, 
concentration, and release from the vehicle.
                  The acid pH helps restore normal cutaneous acidity. Owing to its excellent 
spreading and penetrating properties, the cream facilitates treatment of hairy 
and intertriginous areas. It may also be of value in selective cases where the 
lesions are moist.
