                  The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects.
                  Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.
                  Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered.

                           Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. ( )

                           Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. ( )
