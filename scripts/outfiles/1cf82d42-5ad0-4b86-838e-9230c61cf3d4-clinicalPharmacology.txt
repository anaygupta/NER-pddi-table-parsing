                     12.1  Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Tiotropium
is a long-acting, antimuscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an
anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic
receptors, M1 to M5.  In the airways, it exhibits
pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3-receptors at the
smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature
of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated
organ preparations. In preclinical 
                              in vitro
                            as well as 
                              in vivo
                           
studies, prevention of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was
dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The bronchodilation following
inhalation of tiotropium is predominantly a site-specific effect.

                              Cardiovascular
Effects
                           
                           

In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial that enrolled 198 patients with
COPD, the number of subjects with changes from baseline-corrected QT interval
of 30 to 60 msec was higher in the SPIRIVA HandiHaler group as compared with
placebo. This difference was apparent using both the Bazett (QTcB) [20 (20%)
patients vs 12 (12%) patients] and Fredericia (QTcF) [16 (16%) patients vs 1 (1%) patient] corrections of QT for heart rate. No patients in either group had
either QTcB or QTcF of >500 msec. Other clinical studies with SPIRIVA
HandiHaler did not detect an effect of the drug on QTc intervals. 
                        The
effect of SPIRIVA HandiHaler on QT interval was also evaluated in a randomized,
placebo- and positive-controlled crossover study in 53 healthy volunteers.
Subjects received SPIRIVA HandiHaler 18 mcg, 54 mcg (3 times the recommended
dose), or placebo for 12 days. ECG assessments were performed at baseline and
throughout the dosing interval following the first and last dose of study
medication. Relative to placebo, the maximum mean change from baseline in
study-specific QTc interval was 3.2 msec and 0.8 msec for SPIRIVA HandiHaler 18
mcg and 54 mcg, respectively. No subject showed a new onset of QTc >500 msec
or QTc changes from baseline of ≥60 msec.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3  Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Tiotropium
is administered by dry powder inhalation. In common with other inhaled drugs,
the majority of the delivered dose is deposited in the gastrointestinal tract
and, to a lesser extent, in the lung, the intended organ. Many of the
pharmacokinetic data described below were obtained with higher doses than
recommended for therapy.
                        
                           
                              Absorption
                           
                           

Following dry powder inhalation by young healthy volunteers, the absolute bioavailability
of 19.5% suggests that the fraction reaching the lung is highly bioavailable.
It is expected from the chemical structure of the compound (quaternary ammonium
compound) that tiotropium is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The
effect of food on tiotropium's bioavailability has not been studied.  Oral
solutions of tiotropium have an absolute bioavailability of 2% to 3%.
Maximum tiotropium plasma concentrations were observed 5 minutes after
inhalation.
                        
                           
                              Distribution
                           
                           

Tiotropium shows a volume of distribution of 32 L/kg indicating that the drug binds
extensively to tissues. The human plasma protein binding for tiotropium is 72%.
At steady state, peak tiotropium plasma levels in COPD patients were 17 to 19
pg/mL when measured 5 minutes after dry powder inhalation of an 18 mcg dose and
decreased in a multi-compartmental manner. Steady-state trough plasma
concentrations were 3 to 4 pg/mL. Local concentrations in the lung
are not known, but the mode of administration suggests substantially higher
concentrations in the lung. Studies in rats have shown that tiotropium does not
readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier.
                        
                           
                              Metabolism
                           
                           

The extent of metabolism appears to be small. This is evident from a urinary
excretion of 74% of unchanged substance after an intravenous dose to young
healthy volunteers. Tiotropium, an ester, is nonenzymatically cleaved to the
alcohol 
                              N
                           -methylscopine and dithienylglycolic acid, neither of which
bind to muscarinic receptors.
                        
                           
                              In
vitro
                            experiments with human liver
microsomes and human hepatocytes suggest that a fraction of the administered
dose (74% of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, leaving
25% for metabolism) is metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation and
subsequent glutathione conjugation to a variety of Phase II metabolites. This
enzymatic pathway can be inhibited by CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors, such as
quinidine, ketoconazole, and gestodene. Thus, CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 are involved
in the metabolic pathway that is responsible for the elimination of a small
part of the administered dose. 
                              In vitro
                            studies using human liver
microsomes showed that tiotropium in supra-therapeutic concentrations did not
inhibit CYP450 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4.
                        
                           
                              Elimination
                           
                           

The terminal elimination half-life of tiotropium was between 5 and 6 days following
inhalation. Total clearance was 880 mL/min after an intravenous dose in young
healthy volunteers with an inter-individual variability of 22%. Intravenously
administered tiotropium was mainly excreted unchanged in urine (74%). After dry
powder inhalation, urinary excretion was 14% of the dose, the remainder being
mainly non-absorbed drug in the gut which was eliminated via the feces. The
renal clearance of tiotropium exceeds the creatinine clearance, indicating
active secretion into the urine. After chronic once-daily inhalation by COPD
patients, pharmacokinetic steady state was reached after 2 to 3 weeks
with no accumulation thereafter.
                        
                           
                              Drug Interactions
                           
                           

An interaction study with tiotropium (14.4 mcg intravenous infusion over 15
minutes) and cimetidine 400 mg three times daily or ranitidine 300 mg once
daily was conducted. Concomitant administration of cimetidine with tiotropium
resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC0-4h, a 28% decrease in the
renal clearance of tiotropium and no significant change in the Cmax
and amount excreted in urine over 96 hours. Co-administration of tiotropium
with ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium.

Patients
                           

As expected for drugs predominantly excreted renally, advanced age was associated
with a decrease of tiotropium renal clearance (326 mL/min in COPD patients
<58 years to 163 mL/min in COPD patients >70 years), which may be
explained by decreased renal function. Tiotropium excretion in urine after
inhalation decreased from 14% (young healthy volunteers) to about 7% (COPD
patients). Plasma concentrations were numerically increased with advancing age
within COPD patients (43% increase in AUC0-4 after dry powder
inhalation), which was not significant when considered in relation to inter-
and intra-individual variability [

                           Renal
Impairment
                           

Since tiotropium is predominantly renally excreted, renal impairment was associated
with increased plasma drug concentrations and reduced drug clearance after both
intravenous infusion and dry powder inhalation. Mild renal impairment (creatinine
clearance of 50 to 80 mL/min), which is often seen in elderly patients,
increased tiotropium plasma concentrations (39% increase in AUC0-4 after
intravenous infusion). In COPD patients with moderate to severe renal
impairment (creatinine clearance of <50 mL/min), the intravenous
administration of tiotropium resulted in doubling of the plasma concentrations
(82% increase in AUC0-4), which was confirmed by plasma
concentrations after dry powder inhalation.  Patients with moderate to severe
renal impairment (creatinine clearance of ≤50 mL/min) treated with
SPIRIVA HandiHaler should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects
