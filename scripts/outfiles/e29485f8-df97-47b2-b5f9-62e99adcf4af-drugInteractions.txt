              (see 
                PRECAUTIONS: Drug
                Interactions
              )
            
                  
 

                  Zidovudine:
            Zidovudine competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of
            stavudine. Therefore, use of zidovudine in combination with stavudine should be
            avoided.
                     

                     
Doxorubicin: In vitro 
            data indicate
            that the phosphorylation of stavudine is inhibited at relevant concentrations by
            doxorubicin.
                     

                     
Ribavirin: In vitro
            data
            indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and
            zidovudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or
            intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or
            pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was
            observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine
            (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV/HCV co-infected
            patients (see 
                     
                         WARNINGS
                     
                  ). 
 
Stavudine does not
            inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and
            CYP3A4; therefore, it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions
            will occur with drugs metabolized through these pathways.
 
Because
            stavudine is not protein-bound, it is not expected to affect the
            pharmacokinetics of protein-bound drugs. 
 
Tables 5 and 6 summarize the
            effects on AUC and Cmax, with a 95% confidence interval
            (CI) when available, following coadministration of stavudine with didanosine,
            lamivudine, and nelfinavir. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic
            interactions were observed.
