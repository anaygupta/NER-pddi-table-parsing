                  No in vitro or in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with SYLVANT.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Cytochrome P450 Substrates
                     
                        Cytochrome P450s in the liver are down regulated by infection and inflammation stimuli including cytokines such as IL-6. Inhibition of IL-6 signaling in patients treated with SYLVANT may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels leading to increased metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates compared to metabolism prior to treatment with SYLVANT.
                        Upon initiation or discontinuation of SYLVANT, in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, perform therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) as needed and adjust dose. The effect of SYLVANT on CYP450 enzyme activity can persist for several weeks after stopping therapy. Exercise caution when SYLVANT is co-administered with CYP3A4 substrate drugs where a decrease in effectiveness would be undesirable (e.g., oral contraceptives, lovastatin, atorvastatin).
