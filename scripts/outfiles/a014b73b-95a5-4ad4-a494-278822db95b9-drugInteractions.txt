                              Drugs undergoing CYP450 metabolism
                           
                           
                              Sotalol is primarily eliminated by renal excretion; therefore, drugs that are metabolized by CYP450 are not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of sotalol. Sotalol is not expected to inhibit or induce any CYP450 enzymes; therefore, it is not expected to alter the PK of drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Antiarrhythmics
                           
                           
                              Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, quinidine and procainamide and other Class III drugs (e.g., amiodarone) are not recommended as concomitant therapy with sotalol, because of their potential to prolong refractoriness (see 
                                    WARNINGS
                                 ). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class Ib or Ic antiarrhythmics. Additive Class II effects would also be anticipated with the use of other beta-blocking agents concomitantly with sotalol.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Digoxin
                           
                           
                              Single and multiple doses of sotalol do not substantially affect serum digoxin levels. Proarrhythmic events were more common in sotalol treated patients also receiving digoxin; it is not clear whether this represents an interaction or is related to the presence of CHF, a known risk factor for proarrhythmia, in the patients receiving digoxin. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Calcium-blocking drugs
                           
                           
                              Sotalol should be administered with caution in conjunction with calcium-blocking drugs because of possible additive effects on atrioventricular conduction or ventricular function. Additionally, concomitant use of these drugs may have additive effects on blood pressure, possibly leading to hypotension.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Catecholamine-depleting agents
                           
                           
                              Concomitant use of catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine and guanethidine, with a beta-blocker may produce an excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous tone. Patients treated with sotalol plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely monitored for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce syncope.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Insulin and oral antidiabetics
                           
                           
                              Hyperglycemia may occur, and the dosage of insulin or antidiabetic drugs may require adjustment. Symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Beta-2-receptor stimulants
                           
                           
                              Beta-agonists such as salbutamol, terbutaline and isoprenaline may have to be administered in increased dosages when used concomitantly with sotalol.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Clonidine
                           
                           
                              Beta-blocking drugs may potentiate the rebound hypertension sometimes observed after discontinuation of clonidine; therefore, caution is advised when discontinuing clonidine in patients receiving sotalol.

                              No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed with hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Antacids
                           
                           
                              Administration of sotalol within 2 hours of antacids containing aluminum oxide and magnesium hydroxide should be avoided because it may result in a reduction in Cmax and AUC of 26% and 20%, respectively and consequently in a 25% reduction in the bradycardic effect at rest. Administration of the antacidÂ two hours after sotalol has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of sotalol.

                              Sotalol should be administered with caution in conjunction with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval such as Class I and Class III antiarrhythmic agents, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, astemizole, bepridil, certain oral macrolides, and certain quinolone antibiotics (see 
                                    WARNINGS
