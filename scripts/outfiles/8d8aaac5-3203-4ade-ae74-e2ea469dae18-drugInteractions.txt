                  Drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted. Women who take 
a warfarin anticoagulant and use a miconazole intravaginal cream or suppository 
may be at risk for developing an increased prothrombin time, international 
normalized ratio (INR), and bleeding. The potential for this interaction between 
warfarin and VUSION is unknown.
