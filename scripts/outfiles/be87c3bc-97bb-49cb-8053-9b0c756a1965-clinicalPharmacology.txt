                        VITEKTA is an HIV-1 antiretroviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

                              The effect of multiple doses of elvitegravir 125 mg (1.5 times the lowest recommended dosage) and 250 mg (1.7 times the maximum recommended dosage) (coadministered with 100 mg ritonavir) on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) parallel group thorough QT study in 126 healthy subjects. No clinically meaningful changes in QTc interval were observed with either 125 mg dose or the 250 mg dose. The dose of 250 mg elvitegravir (with 100 mg ritonavir) is expected to cover the high exposure clinical scenario.

                              Following oral administration of VITEKTA and ritonavir with food, in HIV-1 infected subjects, peak elvitegravir plasma concentrations were observed approximately 4 hours post-dose. The steady-state mean elvitegravir pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in Table 5.  Elvitegravir plasma exposures increased in a less than dose proportional manner, likely due to solubility-limited absorption.

                              Elvitegravir is 98–99% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 1 ng/mL to 1.6 µg/mL. The mean plasma-to-blood drug concentration ratio is 1.37.

                              Elvitegravir undergoes primarily oxidative metabolism via CYP3A, and is secondarily glucuronidated via UGT1A1/3 enzymes. Following oral administration of [14C]elvitegravir/ritonavir, elvitegravir was the predominant species in plasma, representing ~94% of the circulating radioactivity. Aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation or glucuronidation metabolites were present in very low levels, displayed considerably lower anti-HIV activity and did not contribute to the overall antiviral activity of elvitegravir.
                              Following oral administration of [14C]elvitegravir/ritonavir, 94.8% of the dose was recovered in feces, consistent with the hepatobiliary excretion of elvitegravir; 6.7% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as metabolites. The median terminal plasma half-life of elvitegravir following administration of VITEKTA and ritonavir was approximately 8.7 hours.

                                    Population pharmacokinetics analysis of elvitegravir in HIV-1 infected subjects indicated that race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of elvitegravir/ritonavir.

                                    No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been observed between men and women for elvitegravir/ritonavir.

                                    The pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 
                                    
                                    Exposures of elvitegravir in adolescents were comparable to those in adults. The steady-state mean elvitegravir Cmax, AUCtau, and Ctrough (mean ± SD) following multiple doses of boosted VITEKTA in HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 12 to less than 18 years were 2.1 ± 0.96 mcg/mL, 25 ± 11 mcg∙hr/mL, and 0.63 ± 0.43 mcg/mL, respectively, for the 85 mg dose, and 2.1 ± 0.74 mcg/mL, 21 ± 7.6 mcg∙hr/mL, and 0.32 ± 0.24 mcg/mL, respectively, for the 150 mg dose of elvitegravir, with inhibitory quotients of ~14 and ~7.1 (ratio of Ctrough: protein binding-adjusted EC95 for wild-type HIV-1 virus for the 85 mg and 150 mg doses, respectively).

                                    Pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir have not been fully evaluated in the elderly (65 years of age and older) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

                                    No clinically relevant differences in elvitegravir pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min) and healthy subjects in a clinical trial [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

                                    Elvitegravir is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver. No clinically relevant differences in elvitegravir pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and healthy subjects in a clinical trial. The effect of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir has not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

                                    Limited data from population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=56) indicated that hepatitis B and/or C virus infection had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of elvitegravir/ritonavir.

                              The drug interaction studies described were conducted with VITEKTA coadministered with ritonavir. 
                              Elvitegravir is primarily metabolized by cytochrome CYP3A. Coadministration of VITEKTA with drugs that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of elvitegravir.
                              In drug interaction studies conducted with elvitegravir coadministered with ritonavir or cobicistat, there was no clinically significant interaction observed between elvitegravir and abacavir, emtricitabine, etravirine, famotidine, omeprazole, stavudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or zidovudine. The effects of coadministered drugs on the exposure of elvitegravir/ritonavir are shown in Table 6. The effects of elvitegravir and ritonavir on the exposure of coadministered drugs are shown in Table 7.

                              Elvitegravir is an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). Integrase is an HIV-1 encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the integration of HIV-1 DNA into host genomic DNA, blocking the formation of the HIV-1 provirus and propagation of the viral infection. Elvitegravir does not inhibit human topoisomerases I or II.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture
                              
                              The antiviral activity of elvitegravir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in T lymphoblastoid cells, monocyte/macrophage cells, and primary peripheral blood lymphocytes. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values ranged from 0.02 to 1.7 nM. Elvitegravir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged from 0.1 to 1.3 nM) and activity against HIV-2 (EC50 value of 0.53 nM). The antiviral activity of elvitegravir with antiretroviral drugs in two-drug combination studies was not antagonistic when combined with the INSTI raltegravir, NNRTIs (efavirenz, etravirine, or nevirapine), NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine), PIs (amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir), the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, or the CCR5 co-receptor antagonist maraviroc.
                              Elvitegravir did not show inhibition of replication of HBV or HCV in cell culture.

                                    HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir were selected in cell culture.  Reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir was associated with the primary integrase substitutions T66A/I, E92G/Q, S147G, and Q148R. Additional integrase substitutions observed in cell culture selection included D10E, S17N, H51Y, F121Y, S153F/Y, E157Q, D232N, R263K, and V281M.

                                    Pooled resistance analysis was performed on virus samples from subjects receiving elvitegravir-containing regimens in 6 clinical trials of elvitegravir (as single drug in combination with a regimen containing a protease inhibitor/ritonavir or as the fixed dose combination STRIBILD) who were viremic with HIV-1 RNA greater than 400 copies/mL at the time of efficacy evaluation (up to 192 weeks). Development of substitutions T66A/I/K, E92G/Q, T97A, S147G, Q148H/K/R, and N155H in the HIV-1 integrase protein was primarily associated with resistance to elvitegravir. In addition to these primary elvitegravir resistance-associated substitutions, E92A, F121C/Y, P145S, Q146I/L/R, and N155S were also occasionally observed and were shown to confer reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir. Substitutions at positions E92 and N155 were the most frequently observed (39% and 27% of those evaluated subjects, respectively). In virus isolates harboring the observed primary elvitegravir resistance-associated substitutions, additional substitutions in integrase were detected including H51Y, L68I/V, G70R, V72A/N, I73V, Q95K/R, S119R, E138A/K, G140A/C/S, E157Q, K160N, E170A, S230R, and D232N.

                                    By Week 96, evidence of emerging primary elvitegravir resistance-associated substitutions T66A/I, E92G/Q, T97A, S147G, Q148R, or N155H was observed in 23 of the 74 subjects with evaluable genotypic data in Study 145. Post-baseline virus isolates harboring primary elvitegravir resistance-associated substitutions had median decreases in susceptibility to elvitegravir of 8-fold (29 isolates, ranging from 2- to greater than 158-fold) and of 5-fold (26 isolates, ranging from 1- to greater than 58-fold) compared to wild-type reference HIV-1 and to their respective baseline isolates, respectively.

                              Cross-resistance has been observed among INSTIs. Among the 23 subjects who developed genotypic resistance to elvitegravir with evidence of emerging primary elvitegravir resistance-associated substitutions in Study 145, 12/21 (57%) subjects with evaluable drug susceptibility data had HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to raltegravir (greater than 1.5-fold, above the biological cutoff for raltegravir).
                              Elvitegravir-resistant viruses showed varying degrees of cross-resistance in cell culture to raltegravir in the INSTI class depending on the type and number of substitutions in HIV-1 integrase. Of the primary elvitegravir resistance-associated substitutions tested (T66A/I/K, E92G/Q, T97A, S147G, Q148H/K/R, and N155H), all but three (T66I, E92G, and S147G) conferred greater than 1.5-fold reduced susceptibility to raltegravir when introduced individually into a wild-type virus by site-directed mutagenesis. Of the primary raltegravir resistance-associated substitutions tested (Y143C/H/R, Q148H/K/R, and N155H), all but one (Y143H) conferred greater than 2.5-fold reductions in susceptibility to elvitegravir (above the biological cutoff for elvitegravir).
