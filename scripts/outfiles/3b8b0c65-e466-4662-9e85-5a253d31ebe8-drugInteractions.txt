                        Ribavirin has been shown in vitro to inhibit phosphorylation of zidovudine and stavudine which could lead to decreased antiretroviral activity. Exposure to didanosine or its active metabolite (dideoxyadenosine 5â€™-triphosphate) is increased when didanosine is coadministered with ribavirin, which could cause or worsen clinical toxicities (see
