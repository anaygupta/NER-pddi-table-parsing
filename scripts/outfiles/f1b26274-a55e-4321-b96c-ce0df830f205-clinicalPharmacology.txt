                  Lidocaine hydrochloride exerts its antiarrhythmic effect by raising the electrical stimulation threshold of the ventricle during diastole.  In usual therapeutic doses, lidocaine hydrochloride produces no change in myocardial contractility, systemic arterial pressure or in absolute refractory period.
                  Onset of action is rapid after an intravenous bolus with a duration of action of approximately 15 to 20 minutes.
                  Approximately 90% of an administered dose of lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized in the liver.  The remainder (10%) of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine.  Pharmacokinetic data indicate reduced elimination of lidocaine after prolonged (24 hours) infusion with resultant prolongation of the half-life to approximately three times that seen following a single administration.
