                  inhibition of the enzymatic oxidation of 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and
                  suppression of other melanocyte metabolic processes. Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light
                  will cause repigmentation of the bleached areas, which may be prevented by the use of
                  sunblocking agents or sunscreen agents contained in the Obagi - C Rx System sun Shield Matte
                  Broad Spectrum SPF 50.
