                     7.1	Cyclosporine
                     
                        Administration of multiple doses of anidulafungin and cyclosporine to healthy subjects resulted in no significant alteration in the steady state pharmacokinetics of either drug. No dosage adjustment of cyclosporine or anidulafungin is needed when the two drugs are co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)
                           ].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Voriconazole
                     
                        Administration of multiple doses of anidulafungin and voriconazole to healthy subjects resulted in no significant alteration in the steady state pharmacokinetics of either drug. No dosage adjustment of voriconazole or anidulafungin is needed when the two drugs are co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)
                           ].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	Tacrolimus
                     
                        Administration of multiple doses of anidulafungin and a single dose of tacrolimus to healthy subjects resulted in no significant alteration in the steady state pharmacokinetics of either drug. No dosage adjustment of tacrolimus or anidulafungin is needed when the two drugs are co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)
                           ].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4	Rifampin
                     
                        Administration of multiple doses of anidulafungin and rifampin to patients resulted in no significant alteration in the steady state pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin. No dosage adjustment of anidulafungin is needed when it is  co-administered with rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)
                           ].

                        Administration of multiple doses of anidulafungin and liposomal amphotericin B to patients resulted in no significant alteration in the steady state pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin. No dosage adjustment of anidulafungin is needed when it is co-administered with liposomal amphotericin B [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)
                           ].
