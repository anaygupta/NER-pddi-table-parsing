                        SPIRIVA HandiHaler has been used concomitantly with short-acting and long-acting sympathomimetic (beta-agonists) bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids without increases in adverse drug reactions.

                        There is potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications.  Therefore, avoid coadministration of SPIRIVA HandiHaler with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects [
