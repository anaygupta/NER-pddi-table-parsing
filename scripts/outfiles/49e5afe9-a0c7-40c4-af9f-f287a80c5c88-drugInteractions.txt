                  In subjects with postmenopausal osteoporosis, Prolia (60 mg subcutaneous injection) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, which is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), indicating that it should not affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by this enzyme in this population [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
