                        Concomitant administration of REGONOL® (pyridostigmine bromide injection USP) and 4-aminopyridine has been reported to delay the onset of action of REGONOL®.9

                              Parenteral administration of high doses of certain antibiotics may intensify or produce neuromuscular block through their own pharmacologic actions. The following antibiotics have been associated with various degrees of paralysis: aminoglycosides (such as neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and dihydrostreptomycin); tetracyclines; bacitracin; polymyxin B; colistin; and sodium colistimethate. If these or other newly introduced antibiotics are used in conjunction with nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs during surgery, unexpected prolongation of neuromuscular block or resistance to its reversal should be considered a possibility.

                              Experience concerning injection of quinidine during recovery from use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants suggest that recurrent paralysis may occur. This possibility must be considered when administering anticholinesterase agents to antagonize neuromuscular blockade induced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.
                              Electrolyte imbalance and diseases which lead to electrolyte imbalance, such as adrenal cortical insufficiency, have been shown to alter neuromuscular blockade. Depending on the nature of the imbalance, either enhancement or inhibition may be expected. Magnesium salts, administered for the management of toxemia of pregnancy, may enhance the neuromuscular blockade. The possibility that such circumstances may interfere with the restoration of neuromuscular function should be considered when administering REGONOL®.
