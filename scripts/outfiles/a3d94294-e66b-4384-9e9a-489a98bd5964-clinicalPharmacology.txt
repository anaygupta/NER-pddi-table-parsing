               Dihydrocodeine is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic/antitussive related to codeine, with multiple 
actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine: the most prominent of these involve the central 
nervous system and organs with smooth muscle components.

                  
Phenylephrine HCl is a sympathomimetic, which acts predominately on alpha-receptors and has 
little action on beta-receptors. It therefore functions as an oral nasal decongestant with minimal 
CNS stimulation.

                  
Guaifenesin is an expectorant, which increases respiratory tract fluid secretions and helps to 
loosen phlegm and bronchial secretions. By reducing the viscosity of secretions, guaifenesin 
increases the efficiency of the cough reflex and of ciliary action in removing accumulated 
secretions from the trachea and bronchi.
