                  Given the primary CNS effects of LATUDA, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. 

               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                            LATUDA is not recommended to be used in combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, e.g., ketoconazole. (
                                 4
                               and 
                                 7.1
                              )

                            Dose adjustment is recommended for moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. diltiazem) (
                                 7.1
                              )

                            LATUDA is not recommended to be used in combination with strong CYP3A4 inducers, e.g., rifampin. (
                                 4
                               and 
                                 7.1
                              )

                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1. Potential for Other Drugs to Affect LATUDA

                     
                        LATUDA is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP4A11, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1 enzymes. This suggests that an interaction of LATUDA with drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes is unlikely.

                        LATUDA is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4; interaction of LATUDA with strong and moderate inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme has been observed (TableÂ 9).  LATUDA should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme [see Contraindications (
                           
                              4
                           
                           )].
                        
                        


                     



                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2. Potential for LATUDA to Affect Other Drugs

                     
                        
                           Digoxin (P-gp substrate):  Coadministration of LATUDA (120 mg/day) at steady state with a single dose of digoxin (0.25 mg) increased Cmax and AUC(0-24) for digoxin by approximately 9% and 13%, respectively relative to digoxin alone.  Digoxin dose adjustment is not required when coadministered with LATUDA.

                        
                           Midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate): Coadministration of LATUDA (120 mg/day) at steady state with a single dose of 5 mg midazolam increased midazolam Cmax and AUC(0-24) by approximately 21% and 44%, respectively relative to midazolam alone.  Midazolam dose adjustment is not required when coadministered with LATUDA.

                        
                           Oral Contraceptive (estrogen/progesterone): Coadministration of LATUDA (40 mg/day) at steady state with an oral contraceptive (OC) containing ethinyl estradiol and norelgestimate resulted in equivalent AUC(0-24) and Cmax of ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin relative to OC administration alone.  Also, sex hormone binding globulin levels were not meaningfully affected by coadministration of LATUDA and OC. Dose adjustment of OC dose is not required when coadministered with LATUDA.
