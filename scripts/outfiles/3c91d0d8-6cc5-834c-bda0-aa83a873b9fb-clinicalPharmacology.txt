                  When injected intravenously, Technetium Tc 99m Medronate is rapidly cleared from the blood; about 50% of the dose is accumulated and retained by the skeleton, while the remaining 50% is excreted in the urine within 24 hours. About 10% of the injected dose remains in the blood at 1 hour post-injection, 5% at 2 hours, and less than 1% remains at 24 hours. The resultant blood clearance curve is tri-exponential with the two fastest components accounting for all but a few percent of the injected dose.

                     
Following intravenous administration of Technetium Tc 99m Medronate, skeletal uptake occurs as a function of blood flow to bone and bone efficiency in extracting the complex. Bone mineral crystals are generally considered to be hydroxyapatite, and the complex appears to have an affinity for the hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone.

                     
The rapid blood clearance provides bone to soft-tissue ratios which favor early imaging. The skeletal uptake is bilaterally symmetrical and is greater in the axial skeleton than in the long bones. Areas of abnormal osteogenesis show altered uptake making it possible to visualize a variety of osseous lesions.
