                        Hydromorphone should be administered cautiously and in reduced dosage to avoid additive effects when other central nervous system depressants including other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) are given concomitantly.
                        Whenever concomitant therapy with MAO inhibitors and narcotic analgesics, including hydromorphone is to be used, an initial small test dose is advisable to allow observation of excessive narcotic effects or MAOI interaction.
