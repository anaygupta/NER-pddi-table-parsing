                        The systemic absorption of ONEXTON Gel has not been evaluated. The systemic absorption of clindamycin was investigated in an open-label, multiple-dose trial in 16 adult subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris treated with 1 gram of a marketed gel containing clindamycin 1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% applied to the face once daily for 30 days. This product has the same formulation as ONEXTON Gel but with a lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide. Twelve subjects (75%) had at least one quantifiable clindamycin plasma concentration above the lower limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.5 ng/mL) on Day 1 or Day 30. On Day 1, the mean (± standard deviation) peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) was 0.78 ± 0.22 ng/mL (n=9 with measurable concentrations), and the mean AUC0-t was 5.29 ± 0.81 h.ng/mL (n=4). On Day 30, the mean Cmax was 1.22 ± 0.88 ng/mL (n=10), and the mean AUC0-t was 8.42 ± 6.01 h.ng/mL (n=6). Clindamycin plasma concentrations were below LOQ in all subjects at 24 hours post-dose on the three tested days (Day 1, 15, and 30).
                        Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid.

                        Clindamycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer, thereby suppressing bacterial protein synthesis.
                        Clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide individually have been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes, an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris. In an in vitro study, the MIC for benzoyl peroxide against Propionibacterium acnes is 128 mg/L. The clinical significance of this activity against P. acnes is not known.
                        
                           P. acnes resistance to clindamycin has been documented. Resistance to clindamycin is often associated with resistance to erythromycin.
