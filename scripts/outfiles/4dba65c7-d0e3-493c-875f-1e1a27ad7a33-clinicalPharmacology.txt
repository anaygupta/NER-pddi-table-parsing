CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Lidocaine hydrochloride is reported to increase the electrical stimulation threshold of the ventricle during diastole and, thereby, exert an antiarrhythmic effect. In the dosage recommended, lidocaine hydrochloride produces no change in systolic arterial blood pressure, absolute refractory period, or myocardial contractility.Clinical studies in which cardiac arrhythmias were monitored indicated that the onset and duration of antiarrhythmic activity of intramuscular lidocaine hydrochloride are correlated with the attained blood levels of lidocaine hydrochloride.The relative blood levels in normal volunteers obtained by a “conventional” intravenous infusion and following the LidoPen® Auto-Injector can be determined by reference to the accompanying chart.® Auto-Injector can be determined by reference to the accompanying chart.Approximately 90% of an administered dose of lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized in the liver. Less than 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged via the kidneys.
