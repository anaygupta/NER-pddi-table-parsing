                        The mechanism of action of calcitriol in the treatment of psoriasis has not been established.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The systemic exposure of calcitriol was assessed in subjects with chronic, plaque psoriasis. In the pivotal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study, calcitriol ointment 3 mcg/g, was applied twice daily for 21 days (for a total dose of 30 g/day) to 35% of the body surface area (psoriatic + surrounding healthy skin) of subjects with at least 25% of body surface area involvement. At Day 21, the geometric mean plasma concentration values of Cmax increased by approximately 36% over baseline and the geometric mean value of AUC(0 â€“ 12 hr) increased by 44%. There was no correlation between the elevated calcitriol levels and the pharmacodynamic parameters of serum albumin adjusted calcium, serum phosphorus, urinary calcium and urinary phosphorus.
