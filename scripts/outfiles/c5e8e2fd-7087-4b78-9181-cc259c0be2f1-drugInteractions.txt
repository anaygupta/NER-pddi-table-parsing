                     7.1 Effects of XIFAXAN on Other Drugs
                     
                        
                           Substrates of Cytochrome P450 enzymes
                        
                        Rifaximin is not expected to inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and CYP3A4 in clinical use based on in vitro studies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        An in vitro study has suggested that rifaximin induces CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  However, in patients with normal liver function, XIFAXAN at the recommended dosing regimen is not expected to induce CYP3A4.  It is unknown whether rifaximin can have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of concomitant CYP3A4 substrates in patients with reduced liver function who have elevated rifaximin concentrations.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Effects of Other Drugs on XIFAXAN
                     
                        
                           In vitro studies suggested that rifaximin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, OATP1A2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  Concomitant cyclosporine, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and OATPs significantly increased the systemic exposure to rifaximin. 
                        
                           Cyclosporine 
                        
                        Co-administration of cyclosporine, with XIFAXAN resulted in 83-fold and 124-fold increases in rifaximin mean Cmax and AUCâˆž in healthy subjects.  The clinical significance of this increase in systemic exposure is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
