               Drug Interactions
Hypotension - Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently
instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with lisinopril. The
possibility of hypotensive effects with lisinopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake
prior to initiation of treatment with lisinopril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, initiate therapy with lisinopril at a dose of
5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized. (See WARNINGS and
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) When a diuretic is added to the therapy of a patient receiving lisinopril an additional
antihypertensive effect is usually observed. Studies with ACE inhibitors in combination with diuretics indicate that the dose of the
ACE inhibitor can be reduced when it is given with a diuretic. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
Antidiabetics: Epidemiological studies have suggested that concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors and antidiabetic medicines
(insulins, oral hypoglycemic agents) may cause an increased blood-glucose-lowering effect with risk of hypoglycemia. This
phenomenon appeared to be more likely to occur during the first weeks of combined treatment and in patients with renal impairment.
In diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin, glycemic control should be closely monitored for hypoglycemia,
especially during the first month of treatment with an ACE inhibitor.

                  
Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents: In some patients with compromised renal function who are being treated with non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, the co-administration of lisinopril may result in further deterioration of renal function. These effects are
usually reversible. In a study in 36 patients with mild to moderate hypertension where the antihypertensive effects of lisinopril alone
were compared to lisinopril given concomitantly with indomethacin, the use of indomethacin was associated with a reduced effect,
although the difference between the two regimens was not significant.
Other Agents: Lisinopril has been used concomitantly with nitrates and/or digoxin without evidence of clinically significant
adverse interactions. This included post myocardial infarction patients who were receiving intravenous or transdermal nitroglycerin.
No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol or
hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril.
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Use of lisinopril with
potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt
substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of
demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. Potassium-sparing
agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failure who are receiving lisinopril.
Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of
sodium, including ACE inhibitors. Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACE inhibitor. It is
recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if lisinopril is administered concomitantly with lithium.
Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients
on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including lisinopril.

                  
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when lisinopril was administered for 105 weeks to male and female rats at doses up
to 90 mg/kg/day (about 56 or 9 times* the maximum recommended daily human dose, based on body weight and body surface area,
respectively). There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when lisinopril was administered for 92 weeks to (male and female) mice at doses up to 135 mg/kg/day (about 84 times the maximum recommended daily human dose). This dose was 6.8 times the maximum
human dose based on body surface area in mice. 

                  
Calculations assume a human weight of 50 kg and human body surface area of 1.62 m2.
Lisinopril was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation. It was also negative in a
forward mutation assay using Chinese hamster lung cells. Lisinopril did not produce single strand DNA breaks in an in vitro alkaline
elution rat hepatocyte assay. In addition, lisinopril did not produce increases in chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro test in Chinese
hamster ovary cells or in an in vivo study in mouse bone marrow.
There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance in male and female rats treated with up to 300 mg/kg/day of lisinopril.
This dose is 188 times and 30 times the maximum human dose when based on mg/kg and mg/m2, respectively.
