                        The sedative action of promethazine is additive to the sedative effects of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, narcotic analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants and tranquilizers; therefore, these agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine.
