                           Oxyphenbutazone
                           
                              Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.

									In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and therefore, insulin requirements.

									Concurrent administration of testosterone with ACTH or corticosteroids may enhance edema formation and should be administered cautiously, particularly in patients with cardiac or hepatic disease.
