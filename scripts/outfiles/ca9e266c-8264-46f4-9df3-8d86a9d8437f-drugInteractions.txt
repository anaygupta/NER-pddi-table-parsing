Drugs which
                                    may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of atracurium
                                    include: enflurane; isoflurane; halothane; certain antibiotics,
                                    especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins; lithium;
                                    magnesium salts; procainamide; and quinidine.If other
                                    muscle relaxants are used during the same procedure, the
                                    possibility of a synergistic or antagonist effect should be
                                    considered.The prior
                                    administration of succinylcholine does not enhance the duration,                      but quickens the onset and may increase the depth, of
                                    neuromuscular block induced by atracurium. Atracurium should not
                                    be administered until a patient has recovered from  succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular block.
