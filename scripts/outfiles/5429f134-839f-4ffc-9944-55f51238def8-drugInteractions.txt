                           Antihypertensive Drugs: SAPHRIS may cause hypotension. (5.7, 7.1, 12.3)

                           Paroxetine (CYP2D6 substrate and inhibitor): Reduce paroxetine by half when used in combination with SAPHRIS.

                     7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with SAPHRIS

                     
                        No dosage adjustment of SAPHRIS is necessary when administered concomitantly with paroxetine (see Table 9 in Drug Interactions (7.1) for paroxetine dosage adjustment), imipramine, cimetidine, valporate, lithium, or a CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin).

                        In addition, valproic acid and lithium pre-dose serum concentrations collected from an adjunctive therapy study were comparable between asenapine-treated patients and placebo-treated patients indicating a lack of effect of asenapine on valproic and lithium plasma levels.
