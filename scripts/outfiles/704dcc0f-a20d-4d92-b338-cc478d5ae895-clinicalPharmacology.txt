Like other topical corticosteroids, clobetasol propionate foam has 
anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The precise 
mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of topical steroids in the treatment 
of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However, 
corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is 
postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of 
inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release 
of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from 
membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.Â
