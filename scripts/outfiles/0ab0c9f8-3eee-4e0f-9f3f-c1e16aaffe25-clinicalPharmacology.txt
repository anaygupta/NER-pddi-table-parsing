                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein. The CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. Ivacaftor facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein.
                        In vitro, ivacaftor increased CFTR-mediated transepithelial current (IT) in rodent cells expressing the G551D-CFTR protein following addition of a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) agonist with an EC50 of 100 ± 47 nM; however, ivacaftor did not increase IT in the absence of cAMP agonist. Ivacaftor also increased IT in human bronchial epithelial cells expressing G551D-CFTR protein following addition of a cAMP agonist by 10-fold with an EC50 of 236 ± 200 nM. Ivacaftor increased the open probability of G551D-CFTR protein in single channel patch clamp experiments using membrane patches from rodent cells expressing G551D-CFTR protein by 6-fold versus untreated cells after addition of PKA and ATP. In addition to G551D-CFTR, ivacaftor increased the channel-open probability of other mutant CFTR forms expressed in rodent cells, resulting in enhanced CFTR-mediated IT. These mutant CFTR forms included G178R-, S549N-, S549R-, G551S-, G970R-, G1244E-, S1251N-, S1255P-, and G1349D-CFTR. Ivacaftor also potentiated the channel-open probability of R117H-CFTR, which has low channel-open probability (gating) and reduced channel current amplitude (conductance) compared to normal CFTR. In vitro responses do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic response or clinical benefit.

                                 Sweat Chloride Evaluation
                              
                              Changes in sweat chloride response to KALYDECO were evaluated in six clinical trials. In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene, one in patients 12 and older (Trial 1) and the other in patients 6-11 years of age (Trial 2), the treatment difference (between KALYDECO and placebo) in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 24 was -48 mmol/L (95% CI -51, -45) and -54 mmol/L (95% CI  -62,  -47), respectively. These changes persisted through 48 weeks. In a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial in patients with CF age 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (Trial 3), the treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 8 weeks of treatment was  -3 mmol/L (95% CI  -6, -0.2). In a two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial in patients with CF who had a G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, G970R, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R mutation in the CFTR gene (Trial 4), the treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 8 weeks of treatment was -49 mmol/L (95% CI -57, -41). In Trial 4, mean changes in sweat chloride for the mutations for which KALYDECO is indicated ranged from -51 to -8, whereas the range for individual subjects with the G970R mutation was -1 to -11 mmol/L. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with CF who had an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene (Trial 5), the mean baseline sweat chloride for all patients was 70 mmol/L. The treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 24 weeks of treatment was -24 mmol/L (95% CI -28, -20) [see Clinical Studies (14)
                                 ]. In an open-label  clinical trial in 34 patients ages 2 to less than 6 years administered either 50 mg or 75 mg of ivacaftor twice daily (Trial 6), the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through 24 weeks of treatment was -45 mmol/L (95% CI -53, -38) [see Pediatric Use (8.4)
                                 ].
                              There was no direct correlation between decrease in sweat chloride levels and improvement in lung function (FEV1).

                              The effect of multiple doses of ivacaftor 150 mg and 450 mg twice daily on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) four-period crossover thorough QT study in 72 healthy subjects. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on Fridericia's correction method (QTcF) was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor is similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF.
                        After oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) occurred at approximately 4 hours, and the mean (±SD) for AUC and Cmax were 10600 (5260) ng*hr/mL and 768 (233) ng/mL, respectively.
                        After every 12-hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an accumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Absorption
                              
                              The exposure of ivacaftor increased approximately 2.5- to 4-fold when given with food that contains fat. Therefore, KALYDECO should be administered with fat-containing food. Examples of fat-containing foods include eggs, butter, peanut butter, cheese pizza, whole-milk dairy products (such as whole milk, cheese, and yogurt), etc. The median (range) Tmax is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in the fed state.
                              KALYDECO granules (2 × 75 mg) had similar bioavailability as the 150 mg tablet when given with fat-containing food in adult subjects. The effect of food on ivacaftor absorption is similar for KALYDECO granules and the 150 mg tablet formulation.

                              Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells.
                              After oral administration of 150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (±SD) for apparent volume of distribution was 353 (122) L.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Metabolism
                              
                              Ivacaftor is extensively metabolized in humans. In vitro and clinical studies indicate that ivacaftor is primarily metabolized by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active.

                              Following oral administration, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the feces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for approximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately 12 hours following a single dose. The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was similar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The CL/F (SD) for the 150 mg dose was 17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects.

                                    Following oral administration of KALYDECO granules, 50 mg every 12 hours, the mean (±SD) steady state AUC (AUCss) was 10500 (4260) ng/mL*h and is similar to the mean AUCss of 10700 (4100) ng/mL*h in adult patients administered KALYDECO tablets, 150 mg every 12 hours.

                                    Following oral administration of KALYDECO granules, 75 mg every 12 hours, the mean (±SD) AUC (AUCss) was 11300 (3820) ng/mL*h and is similar to the mean AUC in adult patients administered KALYDECO tablets, 150 mg every 12 hours.

                                       Hepatic impairment
                                    
                                    Adult subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 -9) had similar ivacaftor Cmax, but an approximately two-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Based on simulations of these results, a reduced KALYDECO dose to one tablet or packet of granules once daily is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The impact of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) on the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor has not been studied, but the increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ is expected to be less than two-fold. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. The impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15) on the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor has not been studied. The magnitude of increase in exposure in these patients is unknown, but is expected to be substantially higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. When benefits are expected to outweigh the risks, KALYDECO should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment at a dose of one tablet or one packet of granules given once daily or less frequently [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)

                                    KALYDECO has not been studied in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or in patients with end-stage renal disease. No dose adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment patients because of minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in a human PK study); however, caution is recommended when administering KALYDECO to patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.

                                    The effect of gender on KALYDECO pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population pharmacokinetics of data from clinical studies of KALYDECO. No dose adjustments are necessary based on gender.

                                    Drug interaction studies were performed with KALYDECO and other drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction studies [see Drug Interactions (7)
                                       ].
                                    Dosing recommendations based on clinical studies or potential drug interactions with KALYDECO are presented below.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Potential for Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs
                                    
                                    Based on in vitro results, ivacaftor and metabolite M1 have the potential to inhibit CYP3A and P-gp. Clinical studies showed that KALYDECO is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp, but not an inhibitor of CYP2C8. In vitro studies suggest that ivacaftor and M1 may inhibit CYP2C9. In vitro, ivacaftor, M1, and M6 were not inducers of CYP isozymes. Dosing recommendations for co-administered drugs with KALYDECO are shown in Figure 1.

                                    In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor and metabolite M1 were substrates of CYP3A enzymes (i.e., CYP3A4 and CYP3A5). Exposure to ivacaftor is reduced by concomitant CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Drug Interactions (7)
                                       ]. KALYDECO dosing recommendations for co-administration with other drugs are shown in Figure 2.
