                     7.1 Strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 Inhibitors
                     
                        Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have a significant increase in exposure to VIMPAT. Dose reduction may be necessary in these patients.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Concomitant Medications that Prolong PR Interval
                     
                        VIMPAT should be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that prolong PR interval, because of a risk of AV block or bradycardia, e.g., beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning VIMPAT, and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered VIMPAT through the intravenous route [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)
                           ].
