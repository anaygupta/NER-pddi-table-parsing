                        Belinostat is primarily metabolized by UGT1A1. Avoid concomitant administration of Beleodaq with strong inhibitors of UGT1A1 [see Clinical Pharmacology (
                              12.3
                           )].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Warfarin
                     
                        Co-administration of Beleodaq and warfarin resulted in no clinically relevant increase in plasma exposure of either R-warfarin or S-warfarin that would require a dose adjustment [see Clinical Pharmacology (
                           
                              12.3)
