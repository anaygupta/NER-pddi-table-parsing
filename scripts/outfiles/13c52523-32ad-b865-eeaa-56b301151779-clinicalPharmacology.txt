                     12.1 MECHANISM OF ACTION
                     
                        Olopatadine is a mast cell stabilizer and a histamine H1 antagonist. Decreased chemotaxis and inhibition of eosinophil activation has also been demonstrated.

                        In healthy subjects, topical ocular dosing of 1 drop of PAZEO once daily for 7 days into both eyes  resulted in mean ± SD (range) steady state plasma olopatadine Cmax and AUC0-12  of 1.6 ± 0.9 ng/mL (0.6 to 4.5 ng/mL) and 9.7 ± 4.4 ng*h/mL (3.7 to 21.2 ng*h/mL), respectively.  The olopatadine Cmax and AUC0-12 after the first dose were similar to those measured on day 7 in these subjects, suggesting that there was no systemic accumulation of olopatadine after repeated topical ocular dosing with PAZEO.  The median (range) time to achieve peak olopatadine concentrations (Tmax) was 2.0 hours (0.25 to 4 hours). The mean ± SD (range) elimination half‑life of olopatadine was 3.4 ± 1.2 hours (2 to 8 hours). N-oxide olopatadine (M3) was detected during the first 4 hours after bilateral topical ocular dosing of PAZEO in approximately half of the subjects and in less than 10% of the total plasma samples collected, at concentrations not exceeding 0.121 ng/mL on day 1 and 0.174 ng/mL on day 7. None of the plasma samples from these subjects had mono-desmethyl olopatadine (M1) concentrations that were above the lower limit of quantitation (0.05 ng/mL) of the PK assay.
