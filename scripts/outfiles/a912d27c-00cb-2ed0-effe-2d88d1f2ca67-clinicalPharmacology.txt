                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        
Albumin is responsible for 75-80% of the colloid osmotic pressure of normal plasma. Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and is a carrier of hormones, enzymes, medicinal products and toxins. [

                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        
Albumin (Human) 5% is approximately isotonic and iso-oncotic with normal human plasma. When treating patients with diminished blood volume, the effect of infused albumin may persist for many hours. The hemodilution lasts for a shorter time when albumin is administered to individuals with normal blood volume. [
