                           Drugs that Prolong QT
                        
                        
								Coadministration of drugs that prolong the QT interval with SIGNIFOR LAR may have additive effects on the prolongation of the QT interval.  Monitor effects on QT interval at 21 days is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

                           Cyclosporine
                        
                        Concomitant administration of cyclosporine with SIGNIFOR LAR may decrease the relative bioavailability of cyclosporine and, therefore, dose adjustment of cyclosporine to maintain therapeutic levels may be necessary.
                        
                           Bromocriptine
                        
                        Coadministration of SIGNIFOR LAR with bromocriptine may increase the blood levels of bromocriptine. Dose reduction of bromocriptine may be necessary.
