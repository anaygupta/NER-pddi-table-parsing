                     12.1	Mechanism of Action
                     
                        XEOMIN blocks cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from peripheral cholinergic nerve endings. This inhibition occurs according to the following sequence: neurotoxin binding to cholinergic nerve terminals, internalization of the neurotoxin into the nerve terminal, translocation of the light-chain part of the molecule into the cytosol of the nerve terminal, and enzymatic cleavage of SNAP25, a presynaptic target protein essential for the release of acetylcholine. Impulse transmission is re-established by the formation of new nerve endings.

                        In patients, recovery from paralysis after intramuscular injection normally occurs within 3-4 months as nerve terminals sprout and reconnect with the muscle endplate.

                        Using currently available analytical technology, it is not possible to detect XEOMIN in the peripheral blood following intramuscular injection at the recommended doses.
