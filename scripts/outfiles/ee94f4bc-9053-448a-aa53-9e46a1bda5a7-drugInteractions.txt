Nitrates, nitrites, alkalinizing agents, primidone, thioxanthenes, methylphenidate, disopyramide, procainamide and quinidine may also potentiate side effects. Monoamine oxidase
                           inhibitors block detoxification of atropine, and thus, potentiate its actions. Concurrent long-term therapy with corticosteroids or haloperidol may increase intraocular pressure. Atropine may antagonize the miotic actions of cholinesterase inhibitors.
    The bronchial relaxation produced by sympathomimetics is enhanced by atropine.
    Inhibition of gastric acid secretion by atropine is antagonized by guanethidine, histamine and reserpine.
    Because of the potential for adverse effects, atropine should be used cautiously with digitalis, slow release digoxin
                           

                               tablets, cholinergics and neostigmine.
    The I.V. administration of atropine in the presence of cyclopropane anesthesia can result in ventricular arrhythmias.
    Atropine may enhance nitrofurantoin and thiazide-diuretic bioavailability by slowing GI motility.
    The effects of metoclopramide on GI motility are antagonized by atropine.
