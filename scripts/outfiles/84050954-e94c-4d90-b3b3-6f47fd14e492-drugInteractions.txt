                           Impact of Propranolol on Other Drugs

                           
                           Warfarin: Warfarin concentrations are increased when administered with propranolol. Monitor prothrombin time accordingly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.7)].
                        
                        
                           Propafenone: Co-administration of propranolol increases the plasma concentrations of propafenone. Monitor patients for symptoms of excessive exposure to propafenone including bradycardia and postural hypotension [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.7)].
                        
                        
                           Impact of Other Drugs on Propranolol

                           
                           CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors: CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. bupropion, fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine), CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, enoxamine, fluvoxamine) and CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, fluvoxamine, ticlopidine) increase exposure to propranolol when co-administered with INDERAL XL. Monitor patients for bradycardia and hypotension [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.7)].
                        
                        
                           CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 Inducers: CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, montelukast, smoking) and CYP2C19 inducers (e.g. rifampin) decrease the plasma levels of propranolol resulting in a loss of efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.7)].
                        
                           Cholestyramine and Colestipol: Co-administered cholestyramine or colestipol significantly reduces the plasma concentrations of co-administered propranolol which may result in loss of efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.7)].

                        Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions
                     
                     
                        
                           Adrenergic Agonists: Beta-blockers may antagonize the antihypertensive effects of clonidine, and rebound hypertension may result if clonidine is withdrawn abruptly. If clonidine and a beta-blocker are co-administered, withdraw the beta-blocker several days before the withdrawal of clonidine. 
 

                           Alpha Blockers: Co-administration of beta-blockers with alpha-blocker (e.g., prazosin) has been associated with prolongation of first dose hypotension and syncope.
                        
                           Dobutamine: Propranolol may reduce sensitivity to dobutamine stress echocardiography in patients undergoing evaluation for myocardial ischemia. 
                        
                           Antidepressants: The hypotensive effect of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants may be exacerbated when administered with beta-blockers. Monitor patients for postural hypotension.

                           Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) may attenuate the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents. Monitor blood pressure.
