                     7.1 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Regorafenib
                     
                        Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) with a single 160 mg dose of Stivarga decreased the mean exposure of regorafenib, increased the mean exposure of the active metabolite M-5, and resulted in no change in the mean exposure of the active metabolite M-2. Avoid concomitant use of Stivarga with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) [see Clinical Pharmacology (
                           12.3
                           )].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Regorafenib
                     
                        Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) with a single 160 mg dose of Stivarga increased the mean exposure of regorafenib and decreased the mean exposure of the active metabolites M-2 and M-5. Avoid concomitant use of Stivarga with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
