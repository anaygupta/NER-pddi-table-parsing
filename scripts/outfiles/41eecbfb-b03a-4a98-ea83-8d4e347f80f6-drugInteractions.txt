                        There are many drugs which may increase or decrease phenytoin levels or which phenytoin may affect. The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below:
                        
                           
                              Drugs which may increase phenytoin serum levels include: Chloramphenicol, dicumarol, disulfiram, tolbutamide, isoniazid, phenylbutazone, acute alcohol intake, salicylates, chlordiazepoxide, phenothiazines, diazepam, estrogens, ethosuximide, halothane, methylphenidate, sulfonamides, cimetidine, trazodone.
                           
                           
                              Drugs which may decrease phenytoin levels include: Carbamazepine, chronic alcohol abuse, reserpine. MobanÂ® brand of Molindone Hydrochloride contains calcium ions which interfere with the absorption of phenytoin. Ingestion times of phenytoin and antacid preparations containing calcium should be staggered in patients with low serum phenytoin levels to prevent absorption problems.
                           
                           
                              Drugs which may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels include: Phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate. Similarly, the effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable.
                           
                           
                              Although not a true drug interaction, tricyclic antidepressants may precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and phenytoin dosage may need to be adjusted.
                           
                           
                              Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin include: Corticosteroids, coumarin anticoagulants, oral contraceptives, quinidine, vitamin D, digitoxin, rifampin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide.
                           
                        
                        Serum level determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected.
