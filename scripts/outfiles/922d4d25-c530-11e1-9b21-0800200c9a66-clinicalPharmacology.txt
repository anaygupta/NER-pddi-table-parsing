                        JUBLIA topical solution is an azole antifungal [see

                        The pharmacodynamics of JUBLIA is unknown.

                        Systemic absorption of efinaconazole in 18 adult subjects with severe onychomycosis was determined after application of JUBLIA once daily for 28 days to patients’ 10 toenails and 0.5 cm adjacent skin. The concentration of efinaconazole in plasma was determined at multiple time points over the course of 24-hour periods on days 1, 14, and 28. Efinaconazole mean ± SD plasma Cmax on Day 28 was 0.67 ± 0.37 ng/mL and the mean ± SD AUC was 12.15 ± 6.91 ng*h/mL. The plasma concentration versus time profile at steady state was generally flat over a 24-hour dosing interval. In a separate study of healthy volunteers, the plasma half-life of efinaconazole following daily applications when applied to all 10 toenails for 7 days was 29.9 hours.
                        
                           Drug Interactions
                        
                        JUBLIA is considered a non-inhibitor of the CYP450 enzyme family. In in vitro studies using human liver microsomes, efinaconazole did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2PE1 and CYP3A4 enzyme activities at expected clinical systemic concentrations. In vitro studies in human primary hepatocytes showed that efinaconazole did not induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 activities.

                           Mechanism of Action
                        
                        Efinaconazole is an azole antifungal. Efinaconazole inhibits fungal lanosterol 14α-demethylase involved in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes.
                        
                           Activity In Vitro and In Vivo
                        
                        Efinaconazole has been shown to be active against isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections. Efinaconazole exhibits in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.06 µg/mL or less against most (≥90%) isolates of the following microorganisms:

                           Mechanism of Resistance
                        
                        Efinaconazole drug resistance development was studied in vitro against T. mentagrophytes, T. rubrum and C. albicans. Serial passage of fungal cultures in the presence of sub-growth inhibitory concentrations of efinaconazole increased the MIC by up to 4-fold. The clinical significance of these in vitro results is unknown.
