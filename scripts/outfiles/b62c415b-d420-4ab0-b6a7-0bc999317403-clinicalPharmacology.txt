                  Hyoscyamine has actions similar to those of atropine, but is more potent in both its central and peripheral effects. This product inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretions. This product controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretion. Once absorbed, this product disperses rapidly in the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The majority of hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours and only traces of hyoscyamine sulfate are found in the breast milk.
