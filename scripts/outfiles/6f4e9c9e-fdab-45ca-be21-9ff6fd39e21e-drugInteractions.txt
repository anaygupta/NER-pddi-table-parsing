                        Aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids reduce the peak serum levels (rate) but not the AUC (extent) of azithromycin (500 mg) absorption.
                        Administration of cimetidine (800 mg) two hours prior to azithromycin had no effect on azithromycin (500 mg) absorption.
                        A single oral dose of 1200 mg azithromycin (2 x 600 mg azithromycin tablets) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single 800 mg oral dose of fluconazole in healthy adult subjects.
                        Total exposure (AUC) and half-life of azithromycin following the single oral tablet dose of 1200 mg were unchanged and the reduction in Cmax was not significant (mean decrease of 18%) by coadministration with 800 mg fluconazole.
                        A single oral dose of 1200 mg azithromycin (2 x 600 mg azithromycin tablets) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir (800 mg indinavir tid for 5 days) in healthy adult subjects.
                        Coadministration of a single oral dose of 1200 mg azithromycin (2 x 600 mg azithromycin tablets) with steady-state nelfinavir (750 mg tid) to healthy adult subjects produced a decrease of approximately 15% in mean AUC0 to 8 of nelfinavir and its M8 metabolite. Mean Cmax of nelfinavir and its M8 metabolite were not significantly affected. No dosage adjustment of nelfinavir is required when nelfinavir is coadministered with azithromycin.
                        Coadministration of nelfinavir (750 mg tid) at steady state with a single oral dose of 1200 mg azithromycin increased the mean AUC0 to ∞ of azithromycin by approximately a factor of 2 times (range of up to 4 times) of that when azithromycin was given alone. The mean Cmax of azithromycin was also increased by approximately a factor of 2 times (range of up to 5 times) of that when azithromycin was given alone. Dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended. However, when administered in conjunction with nelfinavir, close monitoring for known side effects of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted (see 
                              ADVERSE REACTIONS
                           ).
                        Following administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole DS (160 mg/800 mg) for 7 days to healthy adult subjects, coadministration of 1200 mg azithromycin (2 x 600 mg azithromycin tablets) on the 7th day had no significant effects on peak concentrations (Cmax), total exposure (AUC), and the urinary excretion of either trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole.
                        Coadministration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole DS for 7 days had no significant effect on the peak concentration (Cmax) and total exposure (AUC) of azithromycin following administration of the single 1200 mg tablet dose to healthy adult subjects.
                        Administration of a 600 mg single oral dose of azithromycin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz given at 400 mg doses for 7 days to healthy adult subjects.
                        Efavirenz, when administered at a dose of 400 mg for seven days produced a 22% increase in the Cmax of azithromycin administered as a 600 mg single oral dose, while the AUC of azithromycin was not affected.
                        Azithromycin (500 mg Day 1, 250 mg Days 2 to 5) did not affect the plasma levels or pharmacokinetics of theophylline administered as a single intravenous dose. The effect of azithromycin on the plasma levels or pharmacokinetics of theophylline administered in multiple doses resulting in therapeutic steady-state levels of theophylline is not known. However, concurrent use of macrolides and theophylline has been associated with increases in the serum concentrations of theophylline. Therefore, until further data are available, prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of plasma theophylline levels in patients receiving azithromycin and theophylline concomitantly.
                        Although, in a study of 22 healthy men, a 5 day course of azithromycin did not affect the prothrombin time from a subsequently administered dose of warfarin, spontaneous postmarketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of azithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly.
                        Dose adjustments are not indicated when azithromycin and zidovudine are coadministered. When zidovudine (100 mg q3h x 5) was coadministered with daily azithromycin (600 mg, n = 5 or 1200 mg, n = 7), mean Cmax, AUC and Clr increased by 26% (CV 54%), 10% (CV 26%) and 38% (CV 114%), respectively. The mean AUC of phosphorylated zidovudine increased by 75% (CV 95%), while zidovudine glucuronide Cmax and AUC increased by less than 10%. In another study, addition of 1 gram azithromycin per week to a regimen of 10 mg/kg daily zidovudine resulted in 25% (CV 70%) and 13% (CV 37%) increases in zidovudine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Zidovudine glucuronide mean Cmax and AUC increased by 16% (CV 61%) and 8% (CV 32%), respectively.
                        Doses of 1200 mg/day azithromycin for 14 days in 6 subjects increased Cmax of concurrently administered didanosine (200 mg q12h) by 44% (54% CV) and AUC by 14% (23% CV). However, none of these changes were significantly different from those produced in a parallel placebo control group of subjects.
                        Preliminary data suggest that coadministration of azithromycin and rifabutin did not markedly affect the mean serum concentrations of either drug. Administration of 250 mg azithromycin daily for 10 days (500 mg on the first day) produced mean concentrations of azithromycin 1 day after the last dose of 53 ng/mL when coadministered with 300 mg daily rifabutin and 49 mg/mL when coadministered with placebo. Mean concentrations 5 days after the last dose were 23 ng/mL and 21 ng/mL in the two groups of subjects. Administration of 300 mg rifabutin for 10 days produced mean concentrations of rifabutin one half day after the last dose of 60 mg/mL when coadministered with daily 250 mg azithromycin and 71 ng/mL when coadministered with placebo. Mean concentrations 5 days after the last dose were 8.1 ng/mL and 9.2 ng/mL in the two groups of subjects.
                        The following drug interactions have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin; however, no specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction. Nonetheless, they have been observed with macrolide products. Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when azithromycin and these drugs are used concomitantly, careful monitoring of patients is advised:
                        Digoxin–elevated digoxin levels.
                        Ergotamine or dihydroergotamine–acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia.
                        Triazolam–decrease the clearance of triazolam and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of triazolam.
                        Drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system–elevations of serum carbamazepine, cyclosporine, hexobarbital, and phenytoin levels.
