 Drug Interactions






 Diuretics 
Patients on diuretics, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with benazepril hydrochloride tablets. The possibility of hypotensive effects with benazepril hydrochloride tablets can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with benazepril hydrochloride tablets. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).







 Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics 
Benazepril hydrochloride tablets can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently.







 Oral Anticoagulants 
Interaction studies with warfarin and acenocoumarol failed to identify any clinically important effects on the serum concentrations or clinical effects of these anticoagulants.







 Lithium 
Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.







 Other 
No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when benazepril hydrochloride tablets were administered concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, furosemide, digoxin, propranolol, atenolol, naproxen, or cimetidine.Â Benazepril hydrochloride tablets have been used concomitantly with beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, calcium-channel-blocking agents, diuretics, digoxin, and hydralazine, without evidence of clinically important adverse interactions. Benazepril, like other ACE inhibitors, has had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system.
