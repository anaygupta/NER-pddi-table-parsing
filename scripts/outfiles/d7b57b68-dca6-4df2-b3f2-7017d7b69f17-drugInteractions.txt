                        Androgens may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Dosage of the anticoagulant may require 
 reduction in order to maintain satisfactory therapeutic hypoprothrombinemia. 
                        Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of 
 oxyphenbutazone.
                        In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and, therefore, insulin requirements.
