                        Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment of aripiprazole tablets are required when administered concomitantly with famotidine, valproate, lithium, lorazepam. 
In addition, no dosage adjustment is necessary for substrates of CYP2D6 (e.g., dextromethorphan, fluoxetine, paroxetine, or venlafaxine), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, warfarin, escitalopram), or CYP3A4 (e.g., dextromethorphan) when co-administered with aripiprazole tablets. Additionally, no dosage adjustment is necessary for valproate, lithium, lamotrigine, lorazepam, or sertraline when co-administered with aripiprazole tablets. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].
