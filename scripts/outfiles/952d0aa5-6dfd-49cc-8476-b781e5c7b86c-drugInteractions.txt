                        Renal toxicity has been reported in a few patients with liver dysfunction who were given an oral cholecystographic agent followed by intravascular contrast agents. Administration of any intravascular contrast agent should therefore be postponed in patients who have recently received an oral cholecystographic contrast agent.
                        
                           Other drugs should not be mixed with VISIPAQUE Injection.
