                  Topical application of hydroquinone produces a reversible depigmentation of the skin by the inhibition of the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine to 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) [Denton, C., et al., 19521] and suppression of other melanocyte metabolic processes [Jimbow, K., et al., 19742]. Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light will cause repigmentation of the bleached areas [Parrish, J.A. et al., 19783].
