                  PharmacodynamicsNaproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with 
analgesic and antipyretic properties. The sodium salt of naproxen has been 
developed as a more rapidly absorbed formulation of naproxen for use as an 
analgesic. The mechanism of action of the naproxen anion, like that of other 
NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin 
synthetase inhibition.
                  
                     

                  
                  
                  PharmacokineticsNaproxen and naproxen sodium are rapidly and completely absorbed 
from the gastrointestinal tract with an in vivo bioavailability of 95%. The 
different dosage forms of NAPROSYN are bioequivalent in terms of extent of 
absorption (AUC) and peak concentration (Cmax); however, 
the products do differ in their pattern of absorption. These differences between 
naproxen products are related to both the chemical form of naproxen used and its 
formulation. Even with the observed differences in pattern of absorption, the 
elimination half-life of naproxen is unchanged across products ranging from 12 
to 17 hours. Steady-state levels of naproxen are reached in 4 to 5 days, and the 
degree of naproxen accumulation is consistent with this half-life. This suggests 
that the differences in pattern of release play only a negligible role in the 
attainment of steady-state plasma levels.
                  
                  Absorption
                  Immediate ReleaseAfter administration of NAPROSYN tablets, peak plasma levels are 
attained in 2 to 4 hours. After oral administration of ANAPROX, peak plasma 
levels are attained in 1 to 2 hours. The difference in rates between the two 
products is due to the increased aqueous solubility of the sodium salt of 
naproxen used in ANAPROX. Peak plasma levels of naproxen given as NAPROSYN 
Suspension are attained in 1 to 4 hours.
                  
                  Delayed ReleaseEC-NAPROSYN is designed with a pH-sensitive coating to provide a 
barrier to disintegration in the acidic environment of the stomach and to lose 
integrity in the more neutral environment of the small intestine. The enteric 
polymer coating selected for EC-NAPROSYN dissolves above pH 6. When EC-NAPROSYN 
was given to fasted subjects, peak plasma levels were attained about 4 to 6 
hours following the first dose (range: 2 to 12 hours). An in vivo study in man 
using radiolabeled EC-NAPROSYN tablets demonstrated that EC-NAPROSYN dissolves 
primarily in the small intestine rather than in the stomach, so the absorption 
of the drug is delayed until the stomach is emptied.
                  When EC-NAPROSYN and NAPROSYN were given to fasted subjects (n=24) in a 
crossover study following 1 week of dosing, differences in time to peak plasma 
levels (Tmax) were observed, but there were no 
differences in total absorption as measured by Cmax and 
AUC:
                  


                  



                  Antacid EffectsWhen EC-NAPROSYN was given as a single dose with antacid (54 mEq 
buffering capacity), the peak plasma levels of naproxen were unchanged, but the 
time to peak was reduced (mean Tmax fasted 5.6 hours, 
mean Tmax with antacid 5 hours), although not 
significantly.
                  
                  Food EffectsWhen EC-NAPROSYN was given as a single dose with food, peak 
plasma levels in most subjects were achieved in about 12 hours (range: 4 to 24 
hours). Residence time in the small intestine until disintegration was 
independent of food intake. The presence of food prolonged the time the tablets 
remained in the stomach, time to first detectable serum naproxen levels, and 
time to maximal naproxen levels (Tmax), but did not 
affect peak naproxen levels (Cmax).
                  
                  DistributionNaproxen has a volume of distribution of 0.16 L/kg. At 
therapeutic levels naproxen is greater than 99% albumin-bound. At doses of 
naproxen greater than 500 mg/day there is less than proportional increase in 
plasma levels due to an increase in clearance caused by saturation of plasma 
protein binding at higher doses (average trough Css 36.5, 
49.2 and 56.4 mg/L with 500, 1000 and 1500 mg daily doses of naproxen, 
respectively).  The naproxen anion has been found in the milk of lactating women 
at a concentration equivalent to approximately 1% of maximum naproxen 
concentration in plasma (see Precautions: Nursing Mothers). 
                  
                  MetabolismNaproxen is extensively metabolized in the liver to 6-0-desmethyl 
naproxen, and both parent and metabolites do not induce metabolizing enzymes. 
Both naproxen and 6-0-desmethyl naproxen are further metabolized to their 
respective acylglucuronide conjugated metabolites.
                  
                  ExcretionThe clearance of naproxen is 0.13 mL/min/kg. Approximately 95% of 
the naproxen from any dose is excreted in the urine, primarily as naproxen 
(GT 1%), 6-0-desmethyl naproxen (GT 1%) or their conjugates (66% to 92%). The 
plasma half-life of the naproxen anion in humans ranges from 12 to 17 hours. The 
corresponding half-lives of both naproxen's metabolites and conjugates are 
shorter than 12 hours, and their rates of excretion have been found to coincide 
closely with the rate of naproxen disappearance from the plasma. Small amounts, 
3% or less of the administered dose, are excreted in the feces. In patients with 
renal failure metabolites may accumulate (see Warnings: Renal Effects). 
                  
                  Special Populations
                  Pediatric PatientsIn pediatric patients aged 5 to 16 years with arthritis, plasma 
naproxen levels following a 5 mg/kg single dose of naproxen suspension (see Doasge and Administration)  
were 
found to be similar to those found in normal adults following a 500 mg dose. The 
terminal half-life appears to be similar in pediatric and adult patients. 
Pharmacokinetic studies of naproxen were not performed in pediatric patients 
younger than 5 years of age. Pharmacokinetic parameters appear to be similar 
following administration of naproxen suspension or tablets in pediatric 
patients. EC-NAPROSYN has not been studied in subjects under the age of 
18.
                  
                  
                  Geriatric PatientsStudies indicate that although total plasma concentration of 
naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in 
the elderly, although the unbound fraction is GT 1% of the total naproxen 
concentration. Unbound trough naproxen concentrations in elderly subjects have 
been reported to range from 0.12% to 0.19% of total naproxen concentration, 
compared with 0.05% to 0.075% in younger subjects. The clinical significance of 
this finding is unclear, although it is possible that the increase in free 
naproxen concentration could be associated with an increase in the rate of 
adverse events per a given dosage in some elderly patients.
                  
                  RacePharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been 
studied.
                  
                  Hepatic InsufficiencyNaproxen pharmacokinetics has not been determined in subjects 
with hepatic insufficiency.
                  
                  Renal InsufficiencyNaproxen pharmacokinetics has not been determined in subjects 
with renal insufficiency. Given that naproxen, its metabolites and conjugates 
are primarily excreted by the kidney, the potential exists for naproxen 
metabolites to accumulate in the presence of renal insufficiency. Elimination of 
naproxen is decreased in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with 
moderate to severe and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance GT 30 
mL/min) (see Warnings: Renal Effects).
