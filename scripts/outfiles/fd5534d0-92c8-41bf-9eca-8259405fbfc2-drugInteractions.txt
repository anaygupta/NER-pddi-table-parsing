                        If clopidogrel or prasugrel are administered during KENGREAL infusion, they will have no antiplatelet effect until the next dose is administered. Clopidogrel and prasugrel, therefore, should not be administered until KENGREAL infusion is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (
