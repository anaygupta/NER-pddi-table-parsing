Conventional antihistamines should be discontinued at least 5 days before skin testing. Long acting antihistamines should be discontinued for at least 3 weeks prior to skin testing.7 Topical steroids should be discontinued at the skin test site for at least 2-3 weeks before skin testing.7,8
                        
                        Tricyclic antidepressants such as Doxepin should be withheld for at least 7 days before skin testing.9 The physician must determine whether the risk of severe depression occurring in patients who discontinue their medication outweighs the benefits that could be obtained from skin testing. Topical local anesthetics may suppress the flare responses and should be avoided in skin test sites.10
