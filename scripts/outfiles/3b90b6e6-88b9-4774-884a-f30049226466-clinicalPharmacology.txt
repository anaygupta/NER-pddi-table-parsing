                  Ipratropium Bromide Inhalation Solution is an anticholinergic 
(parasympatholytic) agent that, based on animal studies, appears to inhibit 
vagally-mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine, the 
transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve.
                  Anticholinergics prevent the increases in intracellular concentration of 
cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) which are caused by interaction of 
acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle.
                  The bronchodilation following inhalation of Ipratropium Bromide Inhalation 
Solution is primarily a local, site-specific effect, not a systemic one. Much of 
an administered dose is swallowed but not absorbed as shown by fecal excretion 
studies. Following nebulization of a 2 mg dose, a mean 7% of the dose was 
absorbed into the systemic circulation either from the surface of the lung or 
from the gastrointestinal tract. The half-life of elimination is about 1.6 hours 
after intravenous administration. Ipratropium bromide is minimally (0 to 9% in 
vitro) bound to plasma albumin and Î±1-acid glycoproteins. 
It is partially metabolized. Autoradiographic studies in rats have shown that 
ipratropium bromide does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Ipratropium 
Bromide Inhalation Solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic or 
renal insufficiency. It should be used with caution in those patient 
populations.
                  In controlled twelve-week studies in patients with bronchospasm associated 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema) 
significant improvements in pulmonary function (FEV1 
increases of 15% or more) occurred within 15 to 30 minutes, reached a peak in 
1-2 hours and persisted for periods of 4-5 hours in the majority of patients, 
with about 25-38% of the patients demonstrating increases of 15% or more for at 
least 7-8 hours. Continued effectiveness of ipratropium bromide was demonstrated 
throughout the 12-week period. In addition, significant increases in forced 
vital capacity (FVC) have been demonstrated. However, ipratropium bromide did 
not consistently produce significant improvement in subjective symptom scores 
nor in quality of life scores over the 12-week duration of study.
                  Additional controlled 12-week studies were conducted to evaluate the safety 
and effectiveness of Ipratropium Bromide Inhalation Solution administered 
concomitantly with the beta adrenergic bronchodilator solutions metaproterenol 
and albuterol compared with the administration of each of the beta agonists 
alone. Combined therapy produced significant additional improvement in FEV1 and FVC. On combined therapy, the median duration of 15% 
improvement in FEV1 was 5-7 hours, compared with 3-4 
hours in patients receiving a beta agonist alone.
