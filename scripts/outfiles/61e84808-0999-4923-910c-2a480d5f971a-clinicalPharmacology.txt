                  QUADRAMET® (samarium Sm-153 EDTMP) has an                             affinity for bone and concentrates in areas of bone turnover in                             association with hydroxyapatite. In clinical studies employing planar                             imaging techniques, more QUADRAMET® accumulates in                             osteoblastic lesions than in normal bone with a lesion-to-normal bone                             ratio of approximately 5. The mechanism of action of                                 QUADRAMET® in relieving the pain of bone                             metastases is not known.

                        Human protein binding has not been studied; however, in                                     dog, rat and bovine studies, less than 0.5% of samarium-153                                     EDTMP is bound to protein. At physiologic pH, >90% of the                                     complex is present as 153Sm[EDTMP]-5, and                                     <10% as 153SmH[EDTMP]-4. The                                     octanol/ water partition coefficient is                                 <10-5.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Skeletal Uptake
                     
                        The greater the number of metastatic lesions, the more                                     skeletal uptake of Sm-153 radioactivity. The relationship                                     between skeletal uptake and the size of the metastatic lesions                                     has not been studied. The total skeletal uptake of radioactivity                                     was 65.5%± 15.5% of the injected dose in 453 patients                                     with metastatic lesions from a variety of primary malignancies.                                     In a study of 22 patients with a wide range in the number of                                     metastatic sites, the % of the injected dose (% ID) taken up by                                     bone ranged from 56.3% in a patient with 5 metastatic lesions to                                     76.7% in a patient with 52 metastatic lesions. If the number of                                     metastatic lesions is fixed, over the range 0.1 to 3.0 mCi/kg,                                     the % ID taken up by bone is the same regardless of the                                 dose.

                        The complex formed by samarium and EDTMP is excreted as                                     an intact, single species that consists of one atom of the                                     Sm-153 and one molecule of the EDTMP, as shown by an analysis of                                     urine samples from patients (n=5) administered samarium Sm-153                                     EDTMP. Metabolic products of samarium Sm-153 EDTMP were not                                     detected in humans.

                        For QUADRAMET®, calculations of the %                                     ID detected in the whole body, urine and blood were corrected                                     for radionuclide decay. The clearance of activity through the                                     urine is expressed as the cumulated activity excreted. The whole                                     body retention is the simple reciprocal of the cumulated urine                                     activity.

                        Blood: Clearance of radioactivity from the blood                                     demonstrated biexponential kinetics after intravenous injection                                     in 19 patients (10 men, 9 women) with a variety of primary                                     cancers that were metastatic to bone. Over the first 30 minutes,                                     the radioactivity (mean ± SD) in the blood decreased to                                     15% (±8%) of the injected dose with a t 1/2 of 5.5 min                                     (±1.1 min). After 30 minutes, the radioactivity cleared                                     from the blood more slowly with a t1/2 of 65.4 min (±                                     9.6 min). Less than 1% of the dose injected remained in the                                     blood 5 hr after injection.
                        Urine: Samarium Sm-153 EDTMP radioactivity was excreted                                     in the urine after intravenous injection. During the first 6                                     hours, 34.5% (±15.5%) was excreted. Overall, the                                     greater the number of metastatic lesions, the less radioactivity                                     was excreted.

                        The beta particle of 153Sm-EDTMP travels a                                     maximum of 3.0 mm in soft tissue and 1.7 mm in bone. In clinical                                     trials of 78 patients with metastatic bone lesions who had 13                                     specific bone scan sites evaluated, the presence or absence of                                         153Sm-EDTMP uptake is similar to the presence or                                     absence of 99mTc diphosphonate uptake (range 67 to                                     96% agreement depending upon the blinded reader and the site of                                     the body). Whether the amount of 153Sm-EDTMP uptake                                     varies with the size of the lesion or to the presence of                                     osteolytic components has not been studied. The clinical benefit                                     of Sm-153-EDTMP in patients with osteolytic lesions is not                                     known. The relationship of different tumor cell types to                                     clinical response has not been studied.
