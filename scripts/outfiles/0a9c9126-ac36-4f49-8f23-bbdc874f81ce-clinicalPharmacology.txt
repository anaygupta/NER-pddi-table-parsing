                  The pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin and clavulanate were determined in                      a study of 19 pediatric patients, 8 months to 11 years, given Amoxicillin and                      Clavulanate Potassium 600 mg/42.9 mg per 5 mL at an amoxicillin dose of 45                      mg/kg q12h with a snack or meal. The mean plasma amoxicillin and                      clavulanate pharmacokinetic parameter values are listed in the following table.                   
                  


                  


The effect of food on the oral absorption of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium 600 mg/42.9 mg per 5 mL has not been studied.
                  Approximately 50% to 70% of the amoxicillin and approximately 25% to                      40% of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in urine during the first 6                      hours after administration of 10 mL of 250 mg/5 mL suspension of amoxicillin                      and clavulanate potassium.
                  Concurrent administration of probenecid delays amoxicillin excretion but does not delay renal excretion of clavulanic acid.
                  Neither component in Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium 600 mg/42.9 mg per 5 mL is highly protein-bound; clavulanic acid has been found to be approximately 25% bound to human serum and amoxicillin approximately 18% bound.
                  Oral administration of a single dose of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium 600 mg/42.9 mg per 5 mL at 45 mg/kg (based on the amoxicillin component) to pediatric patients, 9 months to 8 years, yielded the following pharmacokinetic data for amoxicillin in plasma and middle ear fluid (MEF).
                  


                  


Dose administered immediately prior to eating.
                  Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid. The results of experiments involving the administration of clavulanic acid to animals suggest that this compound, like amoxicillin, is well distributed in body tissues.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Microbiology:
                     
                        Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic with a broad spectrum                            of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative                            microorganisms. Amoxicillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by                            β-lactamases, and therefore, its spectrum of activity does not include                            organisms which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a β-lactam,                            structurally related to penicillin, which possesses the ability to                            inactivate a wide range of β-lactamase enzymes commonly found in                            microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. In                            particular, it has good activity against the clinically important                            plasmid-mediated β-lactamases frequently found responsible for transferred drug                            resistance.
                        The clavulanic acid component of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium 600 mg/42.9 mg per 5 mL protects                            amoxicillin from degradation by β-lactamase enzymes and effectively                            extends the antibiotic spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria                            normally resistant to amoxicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. Thus,                            Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium 600 mg/42.9 mg per 5 mL possesses the distinctive properties of a broad-spectrum                            antibiotic and a β-lactamase inhibitor.
                        Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against                            most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in                            clinical infections as described in the

However, the safety and efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in                                  treating infections due to these microorganisms have not been                                  established in adequate and well-controlled trials.

Adequate and well-controlled clinical trials have established the                                  effectiveness of amoxicillin alone in treating certain clinical                                  infections due to S.                                  pyogenes.

                        When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should                            provide cumulative results of in vitro susceptibility test results for                            antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the                            physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of                            nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the                            physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Dilution Technique:
                              
                           
                           
                              Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial                                  minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of                                  bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined                                  using a standardized procedure.1,2 Standardized procedures are based                                  on dilution methods (broth for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae) or equivalent with                                  standardized inoculum concentration and standardized                                  concentrations of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium powder. 
                              The recommended dilution pattern utilizes a constant                                  amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium ratio of 2 to 1 in all tubes with                                  varying amounts of amoxicillin. MICs are expressed in terms of the                                  amoxicillin concentration in the presence of clavulanic acid at a                                  constant 2 parts amoxicillin to 1 part clavulanic acid. The MIC                                  values should be interpreted according to criteria provided in                                  Table 3.

                              Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone                                  diameters also provides reproducible estimates of the                                  susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobials. One such standardized                                  technique requires the use of a standardized inoculum                                  concentration.2,3 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with                                  30 mcg amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (20 mcg amoxicillin plus                                  10 mcg clavulanate potassium) to test susceptibility of                                  microorganisms to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium. Disk diffusion                                  zone sizes should be interpreted according to criteria provided in                                  Table 3.
                              


                              



                                 NOTE: Susceptibility of S.                                     pneumoniae should be determined using a 1-mcg oxacillin disk.                                  Isolates with oxacillin zone sizes of ≥ 20 mm are susceptible to                                  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. An amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MIC                                  should be determined on isolates of S. pneumoniae with oxacillin                                  zone sizes of ≤ 19 mm. 
                              
                                 NOTE:                                  β-lactamase–negative, ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates must be                                  considered resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.
                               A report of S (“Susceptible”) indicates that the                                  antimicrobial is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the                                  antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration                                  usually achievable. A report of I (“Intermediate”) indicates that                                  the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the                                  microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically                                  feasible antimicrobials, the test should be repeated. This category                                  implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the                                  drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high                                  doses of antimicrobial can be used. This category also provides a                                  buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from                                  causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of R                                  (“Resistant”) indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to                                  inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound in the                                  blood reaches the concentration usually achievable; other therapy                                  should be selected.
                               Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the                                  use of quality control microorganisms to determine the performance                                  of the test procedures.1-3 Standard amoxicillin/clavulanate                                  potassium powder should provide the MIC ranges for the quality                                  control organisms in Table 4. For the disk diffusion technique, the                                  30 mcg-amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium disk should provide the                                  zone diameter ranges for the quality control organisms in Table                               4.
