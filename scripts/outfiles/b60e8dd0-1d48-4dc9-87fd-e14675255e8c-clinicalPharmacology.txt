                  Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulin. Insulin lowers blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis, proteolysis, and gluconeogenesis, and enhance protein synthesis and conversion of excess glucose into fat.

                  Administered insulin, including Humulin R U-500, substitutes for inadequate endogenous insulin secretion and partially corrects the disordered metabolism and inappropriate hyperglycemia of diabetes mellitus, which are caused by either a deficiency or a reduction in the biologic effectiveness of insulin. When administered in appropriate doses at prescribed intervals to patients with diabetes mellitus, Humulin R U-500 restores their ability to metabolize carbohydrates, proteins and fats.

                  As with all insulin preparations, the duration of action of Humulin R U-500 is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity.

                  Humulin R U-500 is unmodified by any agent that might prolong its action. Clinical experience has shown that it frequently has time action characteristics reflecting both prandial and basal activity. It takes effect within 30 minutes, has a peak similar to that observed with U-100 regular human insulin and has a relatively long duration of activity following a single dose (up to 24 hours) as compared with U-100 regular insulins. This effect has been credited to the high concentration of the preparation. The time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the same individual.
