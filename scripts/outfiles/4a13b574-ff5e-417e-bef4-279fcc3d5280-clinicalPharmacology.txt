                  PharmacokineticsFollowing oral administration of a single 500 mg dose (two 250 mg 
tablets) to 36 fasted healthy male volunteers, the mean (SD) pharmacokinetic 
parameters were AUC0-72 = 4.3 (1.2) mcg•h/mL; Cmax = 0.5 (0.2) mcg/mL; Tmax = 2.2 (0.9) 
hours.
                  With a regimen of 500 mg (two 250 mg capsules 1) on day 1, followed by 250 mg daily (one 250 mg 
capsule) on days 2 through 5, the pharmacokinetic parameters of azithromycin in 
plasma in healthy young adults (18 to 40 years of age) are portrayed in the 
chart below. Cmin and Cmax 
remained essentially unchanged from day 2 through day 5 of therapy.
                  
                  


                  


In a two-way crossover study, 12 adult healthy volunteers (6 males, 6 
females) received 1,500 mg of azithromycin administered in single daily doses 
over either 5 days (two 250 mg tablets on day 1, followed by one 250 mg tablet 
on days 2 to 5) or 3 days (500 mg per day for days 1 to 3). Due to limited serum 
samples on day 2 (3-day regimen) and days 2 to 4 (5-day regimen), the serum 
concentration-time profile of each subject was fit to a 3-compartment model and 
the AUC0-∞ for the fitted concentration profile was 
comparable between the 5-day and 3-day regimens.

                  Median azithromycin exposure (AUC0-288) in mononuclear 
(MN) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes following either the 5-day or 3-day 
regimen was more than a 1000-fold and 800-fold greater than in serum, 
respectively. Administration of the same total dose with either the 5-day or 
3-day regimen may be expected to provide comparable concentrations of 
azithromycin within MN and PMN leukocytes.
                  Two azithromycin 250 mg tablets are bioequivalent to a single 500 mg 
tablet.

                  Azithromycin 250 mg tablets are bioequivalent to 250 mg capsules 
in the fasted state. Azithromycin 250 mg capsules are no longer commercially 
available.
                  
                  
                  AbsorptionThe absolute bioavailability of azithromycin 250 mg capsules is 
38%.
                  In a two-way crossover study in which 12 healthy subjects received a single 
500 mg dose of azithromycin (two 250 mg tablets) with or without a high fat 
meal, food was shown to increase Cmax by 23% but had no 
effect on AUC.
                  When azithromycin suspension was administered with food to 28 adult healthy 
male subjects, Cmax increased by 56% and AUC was 
unchanged.
                  The AUC of azithromycin was unaffected by co-administration of an antacid 
containing aluminum and magnesium hydroxide with azithromycin capsules; however, 
the Cmax was reduced by 24%. Administration of cimetidine 
(800 mg) two hours prior to azithromycin had no effect on azithromycin 
absorption.
                  
                  
                  DistributionThe serum protein binding of azithromycin is variable in the 
concentration range approximating human exposure, decreasing from 51% at 0.02 
mcg /mL to 7% at 2 mcg /mL.
                  Following oral administration, azithromycin is widely distributed throughout 
the body with an apparent steady-state volume of distribution of 31.1 L/kg. 
Greater azithromycin concentrations in tissues than in plasma or serum were 
observed. High tissue concentrations should not be interpreted to be 
quantitatively related to clinical efficacy. The antimicrobial activity of 
azithromycin is pH related and appears to be reduced with decreasing pH. 
However, the extensive distribution of drug to tissues may be relevant to 
clinical activity.
                  Selected tissue (or fluid) concentration and tissue (or fluid) to 
plasma/serum concentration ratios are shown in the following table:
                  

*      Azithromycin tissue concentrations were originally determined using



         250 mg capsules.
#      Sample was obtained 2 to 4 hours after the first dose.
^      Sample was obtained 10 to 12 hours after the first dose.
+      Dosing regimen of two doses of 250 mg each, separated by 12 hours.
**    Sample was obtained 19 hours after a single 500 mg dose.

                  

                  The extensive tissue distribution was confirmed by examination of additional 
tissues and fluids (bone, ejaculum, prostate, ovary, uterus, salpinx, stomach, 
liver, and gallbladder). As there are no data from adequate and well-controlled 
studies of azithromycin treatment of infections in these additional body sites, 
the clinical importance of these tissue concentration data is unknown.
                  Following a regimen of 500 mg on the first day and 250 mg daily for 4 days, 
only very low concentrations were noted in cerebrospinal fluid (less than 0.01 
mcg/mL) in the presence of non-inflamed meninges.
