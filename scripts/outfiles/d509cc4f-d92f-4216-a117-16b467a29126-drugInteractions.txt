                  There is no known pharmacokinetic effect (bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, or pharmacodynamics) of prasterone on prednisone or hydroxychloroquine, with the possible exception of increasing the magnitude of a decrease in triglycerides seen with hydroxyquinoline.

                  Prasterone may theoretically interact with one or more of the following drugs: carbamazepine, phenothiazines (e.g., acetophenazine, chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, ethopropazine, fluphenazine, mesordiazine, methdilazine, perazine, perphenazine, pipotiazine, prochlorperazine, promazine, promethazine, propiomazine, thioridazine, trifluoperazine, triflupromazine), citalopram; escitalopram; clozapine, conjugated estrogens; estherified estrogens; estradiol; estradiol cypionate; estropipate; ethinyl estradiol, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine; haloperidol, lithium, loxapine, molindone, olanzapine, paroxetine, quetiapine, risperodone, sertraline, testosterone, triazolam and valproic acid. For further information on potential interactions with these drugs, please see The Cochrane Review monograph for prasterone.  

               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           PRASTERA® may interact with certain psychiatric drugs. (§8)

                           Concomitant administration of PRASTERA® with endogenous testosterone or estrogens, or dietary supplements containing DHEA or dehydroepiandrosterone,  is not generally recommended unless serum sex hormone levels are monitored, because of the potential to elevate levels above the ranges considered normal in healthy individuals. (§§7.1, 7.2.1, 8, 10, 16.3)
