                     7.1	Erythromycin
                     
                        ACANYA Gel should not be used in combination with topical or oral erythromycin-containing products due to its clindamycin component. In vitro studies have shown antagonism between erythromycin and clindamycin. The clinical significance of this in vitro antagonism is not known.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Neuromuscular Blocking Agents
                     
                        Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, ACANYA Gel should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.
