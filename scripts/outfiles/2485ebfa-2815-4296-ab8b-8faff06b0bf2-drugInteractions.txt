                        Because of the danger involved in the simultaneous use of calcium salts and drugs of the digitalis group, a digitalized patient should not receive an intravenous injection of a calcium compound unless the indications are clearly defined.
                        Calcium salts should not generally be mixed with carbonates, phosphates, sulfates or tartrates in parenteral admixtures.
