                  Oxcarbazepine can inhibit CYP2C19 and induce CYP3A4/5 with potentially important effects on plasma concentrations of other drugs. The inhibition of CYP2C19 by oxcarbazepine and MHD can cause increased plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of CYP2C19. Oxcarbazepine and MHD induce a subgroup of the cytochrome P450 3A family (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) responsible for the metabolism of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, oral contraceptives and cyclosporine resulting in a lower plasma concentration of these drugs.

                  In addition, several AEDs that are cytochrome P450 inducers can decrease plasma concentrations of oxcarbazepine and MHD. No autoinduction has been observed with oxcarbazepine .
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              •Phenytoin: Increased phenytoin levels. Reduced dose of phenytoin may be required. (7.1)
                           
                              •Carbamazepine: Decreased plasma levels of MHD (the active metabolite). Dose adjustments may be necessary. (7.1)
                           
                              •Phenobarbital: Decreased plasma levels of MHD. Dose adjustments may be necessary. (7.1)
                           
                              •Oral Contraceptive: Patients should be advised that oxcarbazepine may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

                        Potential interactions between oxcarbazepine and other AEDs were assessed in clinical studies. The effect of these interactions on mean AUCs and Cmin are summarized in Table 7.
                        


                        



                           In vivo, the plasma levels of phenytoin increased by up to 40% when oxcarbazepine was given at doses above 1200 mg/day. Therefore, when using doses of oxcarbazepine greater than 1200 mg/day during adjunctive therapy, a decrease in the dose of phenytoin may be required. The increase of phenobarbital level, however, is small (15%) when given with oxcarbazepine.
                        Strong inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes (i.e., carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital) have been shown to decrease the plasma levels of MHD (29% to 40%).
                        No autoinduction has been observed with oxcarbazepine.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Hormonal Contraceptives
                     
                        Coadministration of oxcarbazepine with an oral contraceptive has been shown to influence the plasma concentrations of the two hormonal components, ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG). The mean AUC values of EE were decreased by 48% [90% CI: 22 to 65] in one study and 52% [90% CI: 38 to 52] in another study. The mean AUC values of LNG were decreased by 32% [90% CI: 20 to 45] in one study and 52% [90% CI: 42 to 52] in another study. Therefore, concurrent use of oxcarbazepine with hormonal contraceptives may render these contraceptives less effective. Studies with other oral or implant contraceptives have not been conducted.

                        After repeated coadministration of oxcarbazepine, the AUC of felodipine was lowered by 28% [90% CI: 20 to 33]. Verapamil produced a decrease of 20% [90% CI: 18 to 27] of the plasma levels of MHD.

                        Cimetidine, erythromycin and dextropropoxyphene had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of MHD. Results with warfarin show no evidence of interaction with either single or repeated doses of oxcarbazepine.
