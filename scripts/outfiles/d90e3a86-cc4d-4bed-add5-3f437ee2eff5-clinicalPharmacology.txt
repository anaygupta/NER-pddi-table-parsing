                   Vitamin D levels in humans depend on two sources: (1) exposure
                            to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of
                            7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to vitamin D3
                            (cholecalciferol) and (2) dietary intake of either vitamin D2
                            (ergocalciferol) or vitamin D3. Vitamin D2 and
                            vitamin D3 must be metabolically activated in the liver and
                            the kidney before becoming fully active on target tissues. The initial
                            step in the activation process is the introduction of a hydroxyl group
                            in the side chain at C-25 by the hepatic enzyme, CYP 27 (a vitamin
                            D-25-hydroxylase). The products of this reaction are
                            25-(OH)D2 and 25-(OH)D3, respectively. Further
                            hydroxylation of these metabolites occurs in the mitochondria of kidney
                            tissue, catalyzed by renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-α-hydroxylase
                            to produce 1α,25-(OH)2D2, the primary
                            biologically active form of vitamin D2, and
                                1α,25-(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), the
                            biologically active form of vitamin D3. 
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Mechanism of Action
                     
                         Calcitriol
                                    (1α,25-(OH)2D3) and
                                        1α,25-(OH)2D2 regulate blood
                                    calcium at levels required for essential body functions.
                                    Specifically, the biologically active vitamin D metabolites
                                    control the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, the
                                    tubular reabsorption of calcium by the kidney and, in
                                    conjunction with parathyroid hormone (PTH), the mobilization of
                                    calcium from the skeleton. They act directly on bone cells
                                    (osteoblasts) to stimulate skeletal growth, and on the
                                    parathyroid glands to suppress PTH synthesis and secretion.
                                    These functions are mediated by the interaction of these
                                    biologically active metabolites with specific receptor proteins
                                    in the various target tissues. In patients with chronic kidney
                                    disease (CKD), deficient production of biologically active
                                    vitamin D metabolites (due to lack of or insufficient
                                    25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-alpha-hydroxylase activity) leads to
                                    secondary hyperparathyroidism, which contributes to the
                                    development of metabolic bone disease. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
                     
                         Doxercalciferol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal
                                    tract and activated by CYP 27 in the liver to form
                                        1α,25-(OH)2D2 (major
                                    metabolite) and 1α,24-dihydroxyvitamin D2
                                    (minor metabolite). Activation of doxercalciferol does not
                                    require the involvement of the kidneys. 
                         In healthy volunteers, peak blood levels of
                                        1α,25-(OH)2D2, the major
                                    metabolite of doxercalciferol, are attained at 11-12 hours after
                                    repeated oral doses of 5 to 15 mcg of Doxercalciferol and the
                                    mean elimination half-life of
                                        1α,25-(OH)2D2 is
                                    approximately 32 to 37 hours with a range of up to 96 hours. The
                                    mean elimination half-life in patients with end-stage renal
                                    disease (ESRD) on dialysis appears to be similar. Hemodialysis
                                    causes a temporary increase in
                                        1α,25-(OH)2D2 mean
                                    concentrations, presumably due to volume contraction.
                                        1α,25-(OH)2D2 is not removed
                                    from blood during hemodialysis.

                              The safety and effectiveness of Doxercalciferol
                                            Capsules were evaluated in two double-blind,
                                            placebo-controlled, multicentered clinical studies
                                            (Study A and Study B) in a total of 138 patients with
                                            chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis (Stage 5 CKD).
                                            Patients in Study A were an average age of 52 years
                                            (range: 22-75), were 55% male, and were
                                            58% African-American, 31% Caucasian, and
                                            11% Hispanic, and had been on hemodialysis for
                                            an average of 53 months. Patients in Study B were an
                                            average of 52 years (range: 27-75), were 45%
                                            male, and 99% African-American, and 1%
                                            Caucasian, and had been on hemodialysis for an average
                                            of 56 months. After randomization to two groups,
                                            eligible patients underwent an 8-week washout period
                                            during which no vitamin D derivatives were administered
                                            to either group. Subsequently, all patients received
                                            Doxercalciferol Capsules in an open-label fashion for 16
                                            weeks followed by a double-blind period of 8 weeks
                                            during which patients received either Doxercalciferol
                                            Capsules or placebo. The initial dose of Doxercalciferol
                                            during the open-label phase was 10 micrograms after each
                                            dialysis session (3 times weekly) for a total of 30 mcg
                                            per week. The dosage of Doxercalciferol was adjusted as
                                            necessary by the investigator in an attempt to achieve
                                            intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels within a
                                            targeted range of 150 to 300 pg/mL. The maximum dosage
                                            was limited to 20 mcg after each dialysis session (60
                                            mcg/week). If at any time during the trial iPTH fell
                                            below 150 pg/mL, Doxercalciferol was immediately
                                            suspended and restarted at a lower dosage the following
                                            week.

                              One hundred and six of the 138 patients who were
                                            treated with Doxercalciferol Capsules during the 16-week
                                            open-label phase achieved iPTH levels ≤ 300
                                            pg/mL. Ninety-four of these patients exhibited plasma
                                            iPTH levels ≤ 300 pg/mL on at least 3
                                            occasions. Eighty-seven patients had plasma iPTH levels
                                            < 150 pg/mL on at least one occasion during the
                                            open-label phase of study participation. 
                              Mean weekly doses during the 16-week open-label
                                            period in Study A ranged from 14.8 mcg to 28.7 mcg. In
                                            Study B, the mean weekly doses during the 16-week
                                            open-label period ranged from 19.2 mcg to 28 mcg. 
                               Decreases in plasma iPTH from baseline values
                                            were calculated using as baseline the average of the
                                            last 3 values obtained during the 8-week washout phase
                                            and are displayed in 
                                    Table 1
                                  below. 
                              


                              


In both studies, iPTH levels increased
                                            progressively and significantly in 65.9% of the
                                            patients during the 8-week washout (control) period
                                            during which no vitamin D derivatives were administered.
                                            In contrast, Doxercalciferol Capsules treatment resulted
                                            in a statistically significant reduction from baseline
                                            in mean iPTH levels during the 16-week open-label
                                            treatment period in more than 93.5% of the 138
                                            treated patients. During the double-blind period (weeks
                                            17 to 24), the reduction in mean iPTH levels was
                                            maintained in the Doxercalciferol Capsules treatment
                                            group compared to a return to near baseline in the
                                            placebo group. 
                               In the clinical trials, the values for iPTH
                                            varied widely from patient to patient and from week to
                                            week for individual patients.

                                            levels below 300 pg/mL during the open-label and
                                            double-blind phases. Seventy-four of 138 patients
                                            (53.6%) had plasma iPTH levels within the target
                                            range (150-300 pg/mL) during Weeks 14-16. 
                              


                              


During the 8-week double-blind phase, more
                                            patients achieved and maintained the target range of
                                            values for iPTH with Doxercalciferol Capsules than with
                                            placebo.

                              The safety and effectiveness of Doxercalciferol
                                            Capsules were evaluated in two clinical studies in 55
                                            patients with Stage 3 or Stage 4 chronic kidney disease.
                                            Eighty-two percent of the patients were male, the
                                            average age was 64.6 years, 51% were Caucasian,
                                            40% African-American, and the average serum iPTH
                                            level at baseline was 194.6 pg/mL. While levels of
                                            25-(OH) vitamin D were not evaluated at baseline,
                                            retrospective assessments of stored serum revealed that
                                            the mean ± SD serum 25-(OH) vitamin D was 18.5
                                            ± 8.1 ng/mL (range: < 5 to 54 ng/mL) in
                                            the study population. 
                              After randomization to two groups, eligible
                                            patients underwent an 8-week washout period during which
                                            no vitamin D derivatives were administered to either
                                            group. Subsequently, one group received Doxercalciferol
                                            Capsules and the other placebo during a double-blind
                                            period of 24 weeks. The initial dose of Doxercalciferol
                                            was 1 mcg per day. The dosage of Doxercalciferol was
                                            adjusted as necessary by the investigator in order to
                                            reduce intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels to a
                                            target of ≥ 30% below post-washout
                                            baseline. The maximum dosage was limited to 3.5 mcg per
                                            day. If at any time during the trial iPTH fell below 15
                                            pg/mL, Doxercalciferol was immediately suspended and
                                            restarted at a lower dosage the following
                                        week.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Results:
                           
                              Decreases in the mean plasma iPTH from baseline
                                            values were calculated using as baseline the average of
                                            the last 2 values obtained during the 8-week washout
                                            phase. In analyses of pooled data from the two studies,
                                            iPTH levels decreased from baseline by an average of
                                            101.4 pg/mL in the Doxercalciferol Capsules group and by
                                            4.4 pg/mL in the placebo group (p<0.001). Greater
                                            reductions of iPTH with Doxercalciferol Capsules
                                            compared to placebo were observed in each study. Twenty
                                            (74%) of 27 subjects in the Doxercalciferol
                                            Capsules group achieved mean plasma iPTH suppression of
                                            ≥ 30% from baseline for the last four
                                            weeks of treatment, whereas two (7%) of the 28
                                            subjects treated with placebo achieved this level of
                                            iPTH suppression. In the Doxercalciferol-treated
                                            patients, the reductions in plasma iPTH were associated
                                            with a reduction in serum bone-specific alkaline
                                            phosphatase.
