                     General
                     
                        When technetium Tc99m pertechnetate is added to tetrofosmin in the presence of stannous reductant, a lipophilic, cationic technetium Tc99m complex is formed, Tc99m tetrofosmin. This complex is the active ingredient in the reconstituted drug product, on whose biodistribution and pharmacokinetic properties the indications for use depend.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Studies in normal volunteers have demonstrated rapid myocardial uptake of Tc99m tetrofosmin, and rapid blood, liver and lung clearances. Uptake in the myocardium reaches a maximum of about 1.2% of the injected dose (i.d.) at 5 minutes and approximately 1% of the i.d. at 2 hours, respectively. Background activities in the blood, liver and lung were less than 5% of the administered activity in whole blood at 10 minutes post-injection, less than 4.5% i.d., after 60 minutes, and less than 2% i.d. after 30 minutes. Approximately 66% of the injected activity is excreted within 48 hours post-injection, with approximately 40% excreted in the urine and 26% in the feces.
                        The kinetics, elimination and protein binding of Tc99m tetrofosmin have not been determined.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        The pharmacodynamic cellular uptake of tetrofosmin in humans has not been established. In humans the recommended imaging time is 15 minutes at stress and 30 minutes at rest.

                                 1. Exercise Stress Studies
                              
                              A total of 252 subjects with ischemic heart disease or atypical chest pain who had a reason for exercise stress imaging were studied in two open-label, multi-center, clinical studies of MYOVIEW (study a and study b). Of these 252 subjects there were 212 (84%) males and 40 (16%) females with a mean age of 60.5 years (range 33.7 to 82.4 years). At peak exercise, maximum heart rate achieved and peak systolic blood pressure were comparable after MYOVIEW and thallium-201 exercise studies.
                              All subjects had exercise and rest planar imaging with MYOVIEW and thallium-201; 191 (76%) subjects also had single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. The MYOVIEW and thallium-201 images were separated by a mean of 5.1 days (1-14 days before or 2-14 days after MYOVIEW). For MYOVIEW imaging, each subject received 185-296 MBq (5-8 mCi) Tc99m tetrofosmin at peak exercise and 555-888 MBq (15-24 mCi) Tc99m tetrofosmin at rest approximately 4 hours later. For thallium-201 imaging, subjects received thallium-201 55.5-74 MBq (1.5-2.0 mCi) at peak exercise.
                              The images were evaluated for the quality of the image (excellent, good or poor) and the diagnosis (with scores of 0 = normal, 1 = ischemia, 2 = infarct, 3 = mixed infarct and ischemia). The primary outcome variable was the percentage of correct diagnoses in comparison to the final clinical diagnosis. All planar images were blindly read; SPECT images were evaluated by the unblinded investigator. A subset of 181/252 (72%) subjects had coronary angiography comparisons to the planar images of MYOVIEW or thallium-201.
                              In comparison to the clinical diagnosis, results of MYOVIEW and thallium-201 imaging were comparable within the 95% confidence intervals. The results for each blinded reader are noted in Table 4.

                              MYOVIEW imaging after pharmacologic stress was evaluated in two studies in subjects with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Three blinded reads were obtained for 57 subjects (45 male [79%], 12 female [21%]; mean age 60.1 years) all of whom had angiography. A subset of 19 subjects also had thallium-201 SPECT imaging. Subject level analyses were based on the finding of SPECT myocardial perfusion abnormalities in patients with angiographically confirmed disease. Subject level sensitivities for MYOVIEW ranged from 68-83% across readers and studies. Subject level sensitivities for thallium-201 ranged from 79-89% across readers.

                              Two open-label, multicenter, identically designed, blinded image read clinical studies were conducted to assess left ventricular function using MYOVIEW ECG gated SPECT (GSPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging. A total of 329 subjects (216 male [65.7%], 113 female [34.3%]); mean age of 60.4 years) with known or suspected heart disease or requiring ventricular function assessments were dosed with MYOVIEW. Of these, 297 were considered evaluable. MYOVIEW was administered at rest and at peak stress using either a one-day or a 2-day dosing protocol.
                              For both studies, all subjects' stress GSPECT exams were compared to the reference exam of radionuclide ventriculography with Tc99m labeled RBCs (multiple gated acquisition [MUGA]), performed 1 to 5 days after the second MYOVIEW injection. All subjects' GSPECT exams were assessed by 3 independent blinded readers per study. The MUGA exams were evaluated as a truth standard by an independent consensus panel composed of 3 blinded readers. Subject level assessments were based upon discrimination between normal and abnormal values for LVEF (LVEF â‰¥50% was considered normal) and normal and abnormal wall motion as judged visually. Sensitivity and specificity of LVEF determinations ranged from 81%-88% and 76%-85% respectively (across studies and readers). Sensitivity and specificity of wall motion determinations ranged from 80%-92% and 68%-86% respectively (across studies and readers). In an analysis of LVEF by severity of dysfunction (i.e. mild dysfunction 40%-49%, moderate dysfunction 30%-39%, severe dysfunction of <30%), across subgroups there was individual reader variation in agreement with MUGA. These studies were not designed to determine whether differences between GSPECT and MUGA LVEF values were due to over estimation or under estimation by either of the methods.
