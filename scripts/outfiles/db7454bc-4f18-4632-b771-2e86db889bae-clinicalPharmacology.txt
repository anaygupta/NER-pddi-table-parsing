                  Selenium is part of glutathione peroxidase which protects cell components from oxidative damage due to peroxides produced in cellular metabolism.
                  Prolonged TPN support in humans has resulted in selenium deficiency symptoms which include muscle pain and tenderness. The symptoms have been reported to respond to supplementation of TPN solutions with selenium.
                  Pediatric conditions, Keshan disease, and Kwashiorkor, have been associated with low dietary intake of selenium. The conditions are endemic to geographical areas with low selenium soil content. Dietary supplementation with selenium salts has been reported to reduce the incidence of the conditions among affected children.
                  Normal blood levels of selenium in different human populations have been found to vary and depend on the selenium content of the food consumed. Results of surveys carried out in some countries are tabulated below:
                  


                  


Plasma selenium levels of 0.3 and 0.9 mcg/100 mL have been reported to produce deficiency symptoms in humans.
                  Selenium is eliminated primarily in urine. However, significant endogenous losses through feces also occur. The rate of excretion and the relative importance of two routes varies with the chemical form of selenium used in supplementation. Ancillary routes of elimination are lungs and skin.
