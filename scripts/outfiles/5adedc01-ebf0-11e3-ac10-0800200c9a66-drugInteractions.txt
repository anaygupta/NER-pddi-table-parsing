                           7.1 Clinically Important Interactions with APTENSIO XR
                        
                        
                           Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)
                        
                        Do not administer APTENSIO XR concomitantly or within 14 days after discontinuing MAOI treatment. Concomitant use of MAOIs and CNS stimulants can cause hypertensive crisis. Potential outcomes include death, stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, ophthalmological complications, eclampsia, pulmonary edema, and renal failure [see Contraindications (4)].
