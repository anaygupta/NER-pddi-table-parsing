                           Adapalene
                        
                        Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown.
                        
                           Benzoyl peroxide
                        
                        Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects.

                        Pharmacodynamics of EPIDUO FORTE gel is unknown.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range 1.6-3.1 grams/day) of EPIDUO FORTE gel applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest, and upper back.
                        After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean Cmax of 0.16 ± 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC0-24hr of 2.49 ± 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene Cmax and AUC0-24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route.
                        Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine.
