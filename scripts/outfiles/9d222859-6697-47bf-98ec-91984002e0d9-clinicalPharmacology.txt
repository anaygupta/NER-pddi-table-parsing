                     Mechanism Of Action
                  
                  
                     Tizanidine is an agonist at α2-adrenergic receptor sites and presumably reduces spasticity 
by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. In animal models, 
tizanidine has no direct effect on skeletal muscle fibers or the neuromuscular 
junction, and no major effect on monosynaptic spinal reflexes.  The effects of 
tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these 
actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons.
                   The imidazoline chemical structure of tizanidine is related to that of the 
anti-hypertensive drug clonidine and other α2-adrenergic 
agonists. Pharmacological studies in animals show similarities between the two 
compounds, but tizanidine was found to have one-tenth to one-fiftieth (1/50) of 
the potency of clonidine in lowering blood pressure.
