                        Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions. Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially. [see
