                  Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs, such as prednisone, are primarily used for their potent antiinflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.
                  Glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body's immune response to diverse stimuli.
