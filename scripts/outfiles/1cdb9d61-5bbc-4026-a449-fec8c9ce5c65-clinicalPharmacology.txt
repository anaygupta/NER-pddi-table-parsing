                     Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Ropinirole is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist with high relative specificity and full intrinsic activity at the D and D dopamine receptor subtypes, binding with higher affinity to D than to D or D receptor subtypes.

                        Ropinirole has moderate affinity for opioid receptors. Ropinirole and its metabolites have negligible affinity for dopamine D1, 5-HT , 5-HT , benzodiazepine, GABA, muscarinic, alpha , alpha , and beta-adrenoreceptors.

                              The precise mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease is unknown, although it is believed to be due to stimulation of postsynaptic dopamine D -type receptors within the caudate-putamen in the brain. This conclusion is supported by studies that show that ropinirole improves motor function in various animal models of Parkinson’s disease. In particular, ropinirole attenuates the motor deficits induced by lesioning the ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in primates. The relevance of D binding in Parkinson’s disease is unknown.

                           Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)
                           
                              The precise mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome (also known as Ekbom Syndrome) is unknown. Although the pathophysiology of RLS is largely unknown, neuropharmacological evidence suggests primary dopaminergic system involvement. Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies suggest that a mild striatal presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of RLS.

                        In healthy normotensive subjects, single oral doses of ropinirole in the range 0.01 to 2.5 mg had little or no effect on supine blood pressure and pulse rates. Upon standing, ropinirole caused decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at doses above 0.25 mg. In some subjects, these changes were associated with the emergence of orthostatic symptoms, bradycardia, and, in one case, transient sinus arrest with syncope. With repeat dosing and slow titration up to 4 mg once daily in healthy volunteers, postural hypotension or hypotension-related adverse events were noted in 13% of subjects on ropinirole and none of the subjects on placebo.
                        The mechanism of postural hypotension induced by ropinirole is presumed to be due to a D -mediated blunting of the noradrenergic response to standing and subsequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Nausea is a common concomitant symptom of orthostatic signs and symptoms.

                        At oral doses as low as 0.2 mg, ropinirole suppressed serum prolactin concentrations in healthy male volunteers.
                        Ropinirole had no dose-related effect on ECG wave form and rhythm in young, healthy, male volunteers in the range of 0.01 to 2.5 mg.
                        Ropinirole had no dose- or exposure-related effect on mean QT intervals in healthy male and female volunteers titrated to doses up to 4 mg/day. The effect of ropinirole on QT intervals at higher exposures achieved either due to drug interactions or at doses used in Parkinson’s disease has not been systematically evaluated.

                              The pharmacokinetics of ropinirole are similar in Parkinson's disease patients and patients with Restless Legs Syndrome. Ropinirole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak concentration in approximately 1 to 2 hours. In clinical studies, over 88% of a radiolabeled dose was recovered in urine and the absolute bioavailability was 55%, indicating a first-pass effect. Relative bioavailability from a tablet compared to an oral solution is 85%. Food does not affect the extent of absorption of ropinirole, although its T is increased by 2.5 hours and its C is decreased by approximately 25% when the drug is taken with a high-fat meal. The clearance of ropinirole after oral administration to patients is 47 L/hr (cv = 45%) and its elimination half-life is approximately 6 hours. Ropinirole is extensively metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites and displays linear kinetics over the therapeutic dosing range of 1 to 8 mg three times daily. Steady-state concentrations are expected to be achieved within 2 days of dosing. Accumulation upon multiple dosing is predictive from single dosing.

                              Ropinirole is widely distributed throughout the body, with an apparent volume of distribution of 7.5 L/kg (cv = 32%). It is up to 40% bound to plasma proteins and has a blood-to-plasma ratio of 1:1.
                              The major metabolic pathways are N-despropylation and hydroxylation to form the inactive N-despropyl and hydroxy metabolites. studies indicate that the major cytochrome P isozyme involved in the metabolism of ropinirole is CYP1A2, an enzyme known to be stimulated by smoking and omeprazole, and inhibited by, for example, fluvoxamine, mexiletine, and the older fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. The N-despropyl metabolite is converted to carbamyl glucuronide, carboxylic acid, and N-despropyl hydroxy metabolites. The hydroxy metabolite of ropinirole is rapidly glucuronidated. Less than 10% of the administered dose is excreted as unchanged drug in urine. N-despropyl ropinirole is the predominant metabolite found in urine (40%), followed by the carboxylic acid metabolite (10%), and the glucuronide of the hydroxy metabolite (10%).

                              metabolism studies showed that CYP1A2 was the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ropinirole. Inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme have been shown to alter its clearance when coadministered with ropinirole. Therefore, if therapy with a drug known to be a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole, adjustment of the dose of ropinirole may be required.

                        Because therapy with ropinirole is initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated upward according to clinical tolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the initial dose based on gender, weight, or age is not necessary.

                              Oral clearance of ropinirole is reduced by 30% in patients above 65 years of age compared to younger patients. Dosage adjustment is not necessary in the elderly (above 65 years), as the dose of ropinirole is to be individually titrated to clinical response.

                              Smoking is expected to increase the clearance of ropinirole since CYP1A2 is known to be induced by smoking. In a study in patients with RLS, smokers (N=7) had an approximate 30% lower C and a 38% lower AUC than did nonsmokers (N=11), when those parameters were normalized for dose.

                              Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, no difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of ropinirole in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance between 30 to 50 mL/min.) compared to an age-matched population with creatinine clearance above 50 mL/min. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary in moderately renally impaired patients. The use of ropinirole hydrochloride in patients with severe renal impairment has not been studied.
                              The effect of hemodialysis on drug removal is not known, but because of the relatively high apparent volume of distribution of ropinirole (525 L), the removal of the drug by hemodialysis is unlikely.

These patients may have higher plasma levels and lower clearance of the drug than patients with normal hepatic function. The drug should be titrated with caution in this population.

                              The effectiveness of ropinirole in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of 11 randomized, controlled trials. Four were conducted in patients with early Parkinson’s disease and no concomitant levodopa (L-dopa), and 7 were conducted in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease with concomitant L-dopa.
                              Among these 11 studies, three placebo-controlled studies provide the most persuasive evidence of ropinirole’s effectiveness in the management of patients with Parkinson’s disease who were and were not receiving concomitant L-dopa. Two of these three trials enrolled patients with early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa) and one enrolled patients receiving L-dopa.
                              In these studies a variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment (e.g., the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], Clinical Global Impression [CGI] scores, patient diaries recording time “on” and “off,” and tolerability of L-dopa dose reductions).
                              In both studies of early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa) patients, the motor component (Part III) of the UPDRS was the primary outcome assessment. The UPDRS is a four-part multi-item rating scale intended to evaluate mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (Part II), motor performance (Part III), and complications of therapy (Part IV). Part III of the UPDRS contains 14 items designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings in patients with Parkinson’s disease (e.g., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, etc.) scored for different body regions and has a maximum (worst) score of 108. Responders were defined as patients with at least a 30% reduction in the Part III score.
                              In the study of advanced Parkinson’s disease (with L-dopa) patients, both reduction in percent awake time spent “off” and the ability to reduce the daily use of L-dopa were assessed as a combined endpoint and individually.
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    Studies in Patients With Early Parkinson’s Disease (Without L-dopa)
                                 
                                 
                                    One early therapy study was a 12-week multicenter study in which 63 patients (41 on ropinirole) with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease receiving concomitant anti-Parkinson medication (but not L-dopa) were randomized to either ropinirole or placebo. Patients had a mean disease duration of approximately 2 years. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they presented with bradykinesia and at least tremor, rigidity, or postural instability. In addition, they must have been classified as Hoehn & Yahr Stage I to IV. This scale, ranging from I=unilateral involvement with minimal impairment to V=confined to wheelchair or bed, is a standard instrument used for staging patients with Parkinson’s disease. The primary outcome measure in this trial was the proportion of patients experiencing a decrease (compared to baseline) of at least 30% in the UPDRS motor score.
                                                     
                                    
                                    Patients were titrated for up to 10 weeks, starting at 0.5 mg twice daily, with weekly increments of 0.5 mg twice daily to a maximum of 5 mg twice daily. Once patients reached their maximally tolerated dose (or 5 mg twice daily), they were maintained on that dose through 12 weeks. The mean dose achieved by patients at study endpoint was 7.4 mg/day. At the end of 12 weeks, 71% of patients treated with ropinirole were responders, compared with 41% of patients in the placebo group (p=0.021).
                                    Statistically significant differences between the percentage of responders on ropinirole compared to placebo were seen after 8 weeks of treatment.
                                    In addition, the mean percentage improvement from baseline in the Total Motor Score was 43% in patients treated with ropinirole compared with 21% in patients treated with placebo (p=0.018).
                                    Statistically significant differences in UPDRS motor score between ropinirole and placebo were seen after 2 weeks of treatment.
                                    The median daily dose at which a 30% reduction in UPDRS motor score was sustained was 4 mg.
                                    The second trial in early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa) patients was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month study. Patients were essentially similar to those in the study described above; concomitant use of selegiline was allowed, but patients were not permitted to use anticholinergics or amantadine during the study. Patients had a mean disease duration of 2 years and limited (not more than a 6-week period) or no prior exposure to L-dopa. The starting dose of ropinirole in this trial was 0.25 mg three times daily. The dose was titrated at weekly intervals by increments of 0.25 mg three times daily to a dose of 1 mg three times daily. Further titrations at weekly intervals were at increments of 0.5 mg three times daily up to a dose of 3 mg 3 times daily, and then weekly at increments of 1 mg three times daily. Patients were to be titrated to a dose of at least 1.5 mg three times daily and then to their maximally tolerated dose, up to a maximum of 8 mg three times daily. The mean dose attained in patients at study endpoint was 15.7 mg/day.
                                    The primary measure of effectiveness was the mean percent reduction (improvement) from baseline in the UPDRS Motor Score. In this study 241 patients were enrolled. At the end of the 6-month study, patients treated with ropinirole had 22% improvement in motor score, compared with a 4% worsening in the placebo group (p<0.001).
                                    Statistically significant differences in UPDRS motor score improvement between ropinirole and placebo were seen after 12 weeks of treatment.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    Study in Patients With Advanced Parkinson’s Disease (With L-dopa)
                                 
                                 
                                    This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial evaluated 148 patients (Hoehn & Yahr II to IV) who were not adequately controlled on L-dopa. Patients in this study had a mean disease duration of approximately 9 years, had been exposed to L-dopa for approximately 7 years, and had experienced “on-off” periods with L-dopa therapy. Patients previously receiving stable doses of selegiline, amantadine, and/or anticholinergic agents could continue on these agents during the study. Patients were started at a dose of 0.25 mg 3 three times daily of ropinirole and titrated upward by weekly intervals until an optimal therapeutic response was achieved. The maximum dose of study medication was 8 mg three times daily. All patients had to be titrated to at least a dose of 2.5 mg three times daily. Patients could then be maintained on this dose level or higher for the remainder of the study. Once a dose of 2.5 mg three times daily was achieved, patients underwent a mandatory reduction in their L-dopa dose, to be followed by additional mandatory reductions with continued escalation of the dose of ropinirole. Reductions in the dosage of L-dopa were also allowed if patients experienced adverse events that the investigator considered related to dopaminergic therapy. The mean dose attained at study endpoint was 16.3 mg/day. The primary outcome was the proportion of responders, defined as patients who were able both to achieve a decrease (compared to baseline) of at least 20% in their L-dopa dose and a decrease of at least 20% in the proportion of the time awake in the “off” condition (a period of time during the day when patients are particularly immobile), as determined by patient diary. In addition, the mean percent change from baseline in daily L-dopa dose was examined.
                                    At the end of 6 months, 28% of patients treated with ropinirole were classified as responders (based on combined endpoint) while 11% of patients treated with placebo were responders (p=0.02). Based on the protocol-mandated reductions in L-dopa dosage with escalating doses of ropinirole, patients treated with ropinirole had a 19.4% mean reduction in L-dopa dose while patients treated with placebo had a 3% reduction (p<0.001). L-dopa dosage reduction was also allowed during the study if dyskinesias or other dopaminergic effects occurred. Overall, reduction of L-dopa dose was sustained in 87% of patients treated with ropinirole and in 57% of patients on placebo. On average, the L-dopa dose was reduced by 31% in patients treated with ropinirole.
                                    The mean number of “off” hours per day during baseline was 6.4 hours for patients treated with ropinirole and 7.3 hours for patients treated with placebo. At the end of the 6-month study, patients treated with ropinirole had a mean of 4.9 hours per day of “off” time, while placebo-treated patients had a mean of 6.4 hours per day of “off” time.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)
                           
                              The effectiveness of ropinirole in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adults diagnosed with RLS using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria (see ). Patients were required to have a history of a minimum of 15 RLS episodes/month during the previous month and a total score of ≥15 on the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS scale) at baseline. Patients with RLS secondary to other conditions (e.g., pregnancy, renal failure, and anemia) were excluded. All studies employed flexible dosing, with patients initiating therapy at 0.25 mg ropinirole once daily. Patients were titrated based on clinical response and tolerability over 7 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg once daily. All doses were taken between 1 and 3 hours before bedtime.
                                            INDICATIONS AND USAGE
                              
                              A variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment, including the IRLS Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I) scores. The IRLS Scale contains 10 items designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, sleep disturbance, daytime somnolence, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is 0 to 40, with 0 being absence of RLS symptoms and 40 the most severe symptoms. Three of the controlled studies utilized the change from baseline in the IRLS Scale at the week 12 endpoint as the primary efficacy outcome.
                              Three hundred eighty patients were randomized to receive ropinirole (N=187) or placebo (N=193) in a US study; 284 were randomized to receive either ropinirole (N=146) or placebo (N=138) in a multinational study (excluding US); and 267 patients were randomized to ropinirole (N=131) or placebo (N=136) in a multinational study (including US). Across the 3 studies, the mean duration of RLS was 16 to 22 years (range of 0 to 65 years), mean age was approximately 54 years (range of 18 to 79 years), and approximately 61% were women. The mean dose at week 12 was approximately 2 mg/day for the 3 studies.
                              In all 3 studies, a statistically significant difference between the treatment group receiving ropinirole and the treatment group receiving placebo was observed at week 12 for both the mean change from baseline in the IRLS Scale total score and the percentage of patients rated as responders (much improved or very much improved) on the CGI-I (see ).
                                            Table 1
                              
                              


                              


Long-term maintenance of efficacy in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in a 36-week study. Following a 24-week single-blind treatment phase (flexible doses of ropinirole of 0.25 to 4 mg once daily), patients who were responders (defined as a decrease of >6 points on the IRLS Scale total score relative to baseline) were randomized in double-blind fashion to placebo or continuation of ropinirole for an additional 12 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase of at least 6 points on the IRLS Scale total score to a total score of at least 15, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. For patients who were responders at week 24, the mean dose of ropinirole was 2 mg (range 0.25 to 4 mg). Patients continued on ropinirole demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate compared with patients randomized to placebo (32.6% vs 57.8%, p=0.0156).
