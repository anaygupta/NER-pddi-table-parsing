                  The ammonium ion (NH4
                     +) in the body plays an important role in the maintenance of acid-base balance. The kidney uses ammonium (NH4
                     +) in place of sodium (Na+) to combine with fixed anions in maintaining acid-base balance, especially as a homeostatic compensatory mechanism in metabolic acidosis.
                  When a loss of hydrogen ions (H+) occurs and serum chloride (Cl−) decreases, sodium is made available for combination with bicarbonate (HCO3
                     −). This creates an excess of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) which leads to a rise in blood pH and a state of metabolic alkalosis.
                  The therapeutic effects of ammonium chloride depend upon the ability of the kidney to utilize ammonia in the excretion of an excess of fixed anions and the conversion of ammonia to urea by the liver, thereby liberating hydrogen (H+) and chloride (Cl−) ions into the extracellular fluid.
