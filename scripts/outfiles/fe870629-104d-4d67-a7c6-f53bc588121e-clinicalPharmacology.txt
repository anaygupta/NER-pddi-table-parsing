                  Etoposide has been shown to cause metaphase arrest in chick fibroblasts.  Its main effect, however, appears to be at the G2 portion of the cell cycle in mammalian cells.  Two different dose-dependent responses are seen.  At high concentrations (10 mcg/mL or more), lysis of cells entering mitosis is observed.  At low concentrations (0.3 to 10 mcg/mL), cells are inhibited from entering prophase.  It does not interfere with microtubular assembly.  The predominant macromolecular effect of etoposide appears to be the induction of DNA strand breaks by an interaction with DNA topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        On intravenous administration, the disposition of etoposide is best described as a biphasic process with a distribution half-life of about 1.5 hours and terminal elimination half-life ranging from 4 to 11 hours.  Total body clearance values range from 33 to 48 mL/min or 16 to 36 mL/min/m2 and, like the terminal elimination half-life, are independent of dose over a range 100 to 600 mg/m2.  Over the same dose range, the areas under the plasma concentration vs time curves (AUC) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values increase linearly with dose.  Etoposide does not accumulate in the plasma following daily administration of 100 mg/m2 for 4 to 5 days.
                        The mean volumes of distribution at steady state fall in the range of 18 to 29 liters or 7 to 17 L/m2.  Etoposide enters the CSF poorly.  Although it is detectable in CSF and intracerebral tumors, the concentrations are lower than in extracerebral tumors and in plasma.  Etoposide concentrations are higher in normal lung than in lung metastases and are similar in primary tumors and normal tissues of the myometrium.

                           , etoposide is highly protein bound (97%) to human plasma proteins.  An inverse relationship between plasma albumin levels and etoposide renal clearance is found in children.  In a study determining the effect of other therapeutic agents on the

                        Etoposide binding ratio correlates directly with serum albumin in patients with cancer and in normal volunteers.  The unbound fraction of etoposide significantly correlated with bilirubin in a population of cancer patients.2  Data have suggested a significant inverse correlation between serum albumin concentration and free fraction of etoposide (see

                           ).
                        After intravenous administration of 3H-etoposide (70 to 290 mg/m2), mean recoveries of radioactivity in the urine range from 42 to 67%, and fecal recoveries range from 0 to 16% of the dose.  Less than 50% of an intravenous dose is excreted in the urine as etoposide with mean recoveries of 8 to 35% within 24 hours.
                        In children, approximately 55% of the dose is excreted in the urine as etoposide in 24 hours.  The mean renal clearance of etoposide is 7 to 10 mL/min/m2 or about 35% of the total body clearance over a dose range of 80 to 600 mg/m2.  Etoposide, therefore, is cleared by both renal and nonrenal processes, i.e., metabolism and biliary excretion.  The effect of renal disease on plasma etoposide clearance is not known.
                        Biliary excretion appears to be a minor route of etoposide elimination.  Only 6% or less of an intravenous dose is recovered in the bile as etoposide.  Metabolism accounts for most of the nonrenal clearance of etoposide.  The major urinary metabolite of etoposide in adults and children is the hydroxy acid [4’-demethylepipodophyllic acid-9-(4,6-0-(R)-ethylidene-ß-D-glucopyranoside)], formed by opening of the lactone ring.  It is also present in human plasma, presumably as the trans isomer.  Glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates of etoposide are excreted in human urine and represent 5 to 22% of the dose.  In addition, O-demethylation of the dimethoxyphenol ring occurs through the CYP450 3A4 isoenzyme pathway to produce the corresponding catechol.
                        After intravenous infusion, the Cmax and AUC values exhibit marked intra- and inter-subject variability.
                        In adults, the total body clearance of etoposide is correlated with creatinine clearance, serum albumin concentration, and nonrenal clearance.  Patients with impaired renal function receiving etoposide have exhibited reduced total body clearance, increased AUC and a lower volume of distribution at steady state (see 
                              
                                 PRECAUTIONS
                              
                           ).  Use of cisplatin therapy is associated with reduced total body clearance.  In children, elevated serum SGPT levels are associated with reduced drug total body clearance.  Prior use of cisplatin may also result in a decrease of etoposide total body clearance in children.
                        Although some minor differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between age and gender have been observed, these differences were not considered clinically significant.
