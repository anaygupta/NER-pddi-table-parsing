                  No formal clinical assessments of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between TREANDA and other drugs have been conducted.  
                  Bendamustine's active metabolites, gamma-hydroxy bendamustine (M3) and N-desmethyl-bendamustine (M4), are formed via cytochrome P450 CYP1A2. Inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) have potential to increase plasma concentrations of bendamustine and decrease plasma concentrations of active metabolites.  Inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g., omeprazole, smoking) have potential to decrease plasma concentrations of bendamustine and increase plasma concentrations of its active metabolites.  Caution should be used, or alternative treatments considered if concomitant treatment with CYP1A2 inhibitors or inducers is needed. 
                  The role of active transport systems in bendamustine distribution has not been fully evaluated. In vitro data suggest that P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and/or other efflux transporters may have a role in bendamustine transport.  
                  Based on in vitro data, bendamustine is not likely to inhibit metabolism via human CYP isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2C9/10, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4/5, or to induce metabolism of substrates of cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Concomitant CYP1A2 inducers or inhibitors have the potential to affect the exposure of bendamustine. (7)
