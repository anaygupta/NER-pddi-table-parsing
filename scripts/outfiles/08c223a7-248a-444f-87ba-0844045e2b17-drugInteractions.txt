                        Clonidine may potentiate the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedatives. If a patient receiving clonidine hydrochloride is also taking tricyclic antidepressants, the hypotensive effect of clonidine may be reduced, necessitating an increase in the clonidine dosage.
                        Due to a potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving clonidine concomitantly with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction, e.g. digitalis, calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers.
                        Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats (see Toxicology).
