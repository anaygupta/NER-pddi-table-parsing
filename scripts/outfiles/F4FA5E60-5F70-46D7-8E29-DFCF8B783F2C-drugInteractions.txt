Drug Interactions





Potentially Arrhythmogenic Agents
Any drug known to have the potential to prolong the QT interval should not be used together with INAPSINE. Possible pharmacodynamic interactions can occur between INAPSINE and potentially arrhythmogenic agents such as class I or III antiarrhythmics, antihistamines that prolong the QT interval, antimalarials, calcium channel blockers, neuroleptics that prolong the QT interval, and antidepressants.Caution should be used when patients are taking concomitant drugs known to induce hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia as they may precipitate QT prolongation and interact with INAPSINE. These would include diuretics, laxatives and supraphysiological use of steroid hormones with mineralocorticoid potential.







CNS Depressant Drugs
Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g., barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects with INAPSINE. Following the administration of INAPSINE, the dose of other CNS depressant drugs should be reduced.
