                           Carbidopa/levodopa
                           
                              Carbidopa/levodopa did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole in healthy volunteers (N=10). Pramipexole did not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) or the elimination of carbidopa/levodopa, although it caused an increase in levodopa Cmax by about 40% and a decrease in Tmax from 2.5 to 0.5 hours.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Selegiline
                           
                              In healthy volunteers (N=11), selegiline did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Amantadine
                           
                              Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggest that amantadine may slightly decrease the oral clearance of pramipexole.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Cimetidine
                           
                              Cimetidine, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic bases via the cationic transport system, caused a 50% increase in pramipexole AUC and a 40% increase in half-life (N=12).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Probenecid
                           
                              Probenecid, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic acids via the anionic transporter, did not noticeably influence pramipexole pharmacokinetics (N=12).
