                        The pharmacokinetic parameters of pramlintide are altered when SYMLIN is mixed in the same syringe with regular, NPH, and 70/30 premixed formulations of recombinant human insulin. SYMLIN and insulin must not be mixed and must be administered as separate injections [see

                        SYMLIN has the potential to delay the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. When the rapid onset or threshold concentration of a concomitant orally administered medication is a critical determinant of effectiveness (such as with analgesics, antibiotics, and oral contraceptives), the medication should be administered at least 1 hour prior to SYMLIN injection or 2 hours after SYMLIN injection [see

                     7.3	Drugs Affecting Gastrointestinal Motility
                     
                        Due to its effects on gastric emptying, SYMLIN should not be considered for patients taking medications that alter gastrointestinal motility (e.g., anticholinergic agents such as atropine) or medications that slow the intestinal absorption of nutrients (e.g., alpha-glucosidase inhibitors). Patients using these medications have not been studied in SYMLIN clinical trials [see
                               Warnings and Precautions (5.6)
                           ].

                        The following are examples of medications that may increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia when administered with SYMLIN: oral anti-diabetic products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. SYMLIN and these drugs should be coadministered with caution.
