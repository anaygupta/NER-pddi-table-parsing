                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Lymphoseek (technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept) is a radioactive diagnostic agent.  It accumulates in lymphatic tissue and selectively binds to mannose binding receptors (CD206) located on the surface of macrophages and dendritic cells. Technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept is a macromolecule consisting of multiple units of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and mannose, each covalently attached to a 10 kDa dextran backbone.  The mannose acts as a ligand for the receptor, and the DTPA serves as a chelating agent for labeling with technetium Tc 99m.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        In in vitro studies, technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept exhibited binding to human mannose binding receptors with a primary binding site affinity of Kd = 2.76 x 10-11 M.
                        In clinical studies, technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept has been detectable in lymph nodes within 10 minutes and up to 30 hours after injection.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        In dose-ranging clinical studies, injection site clearance rates were similar across all Lymphoseek doses (4 to 200 mcg) with a mean elimination rate constant in the range of 0.222 to 0.396/hr, resulting in a drug half-life at the injection site of 1.8 to 3.1 hours.
                        The amount of the accumulated radioactive dose in the liver, kidney, and bladder reached a maximum 1 hour post administration of Lymphoseek and was approximately 1% to 2% of the injected dose in each tissue.
