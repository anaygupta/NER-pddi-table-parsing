                     12.1    Mechanism of Action
                     

                  
                  Carglumic acid is a synthetic structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate (NAG), which is an essential allosteric activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS 1) in liver mitochondria.  CPS 1 is the first enzyme of the urea cycle, which converts ammonia into urea.  NAG is the product of N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), a mitochondrial enzyme.  Carglumic acid acts as a replacement for NAG in NAGS deficiency patients by activating CPS 1.
                  
                     12.2    Pharmacodynamics
                     

                  
                  In a retrospective review of the clinical course in 23 patients with NAGS deficiency, carglumic acid reduced plasma ammonia levels within 24 hours when administered with and without concomitant ammonia lowering therapies.  No dose response relationship has been identified.   

                     
                  
                  
                     12.3    Pharmacokinetics
                     

                  
                  The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid has been studied in healthy male volunteers using both radiolabeled and non-radiolabeled carglumic acid.

                     
                  
                  
                     Absorption
                     

                  
                  The median Tmax of Carbaglu was 3 hours (range: 2-4). Absolute bioavailability has not been determined.  

                     
                  
                  
                     Distribution
                     

                  
                  The apparent volume of distribution was 2657 L (range: 1616-5797). Protein binding has not been determined.

                     
                  
                  
                     Metabolism
                     

                  
                  A proportion of carglumic acid may be metabolized by the intestinal bacterial flora.  The likely end product of carglumic acid metabolism is carbon dioxide, eliminated through the lungs.

                     
                  
                  
                     Elimination
                     

                  
                  Median values for the terminal half-life was 5.6 hours (range 4.3-9.5), the apparent total clearance was 5.7 L/min (range 3.0-9.7), the renal clearance was 290 mL/min (range 204-445), and the 24-hour urinary excretion was 4.5% of the dose (range 3.5-7.5).  Following administration of a single radiolabeled oral dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight, 9% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine and up to 60% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the feces.
                  
                     Drug Interaction Studies
                     

                  
                  No drug interaction studies have been performed. Based on in-vitro studies, Carbaglu is not an inducer of CYP1A1/2, CYP2B6, CYP2C, and CYP3A4/5 enzymes, and not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4/5 enzymes.
