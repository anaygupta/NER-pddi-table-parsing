                  In humans, mannitol is confined to the extracellular space and is only slightly metabolized. It is rapidly excreted in the urine. When mannitol is absorbed intravascularly, it produces osmotic diuresis and will be excreted by the kidneys.
                  Mannitol is nonelectrolytic and is, therefore, nonconductive, making it suitable for urologic irrigation during electrosurgical procedures.
                  5% Mannitol is a nonhemolytic irrigating solution.
