                        Antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate, and bismuth preparations are known to suppress H. pylori. Ingestion of antibiotics or bismuth within 4 weeks and proton pump inhibitors or sucralfate within 2 weeks prior to performing the test may give false negative results.
