                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The primary mode of action is thought to be through the osmotic effect of polyethylene glycol 3350 which causes water to be retained in the colon and produces a watery stool.

                        Polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution induces as diarrhea which rapidly cleanses the bowel, usually within four hours.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of PEG 3350 following administration of polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution were not assessed. Available pharmacokinetic information for oral PEG 3350 suggests that it is poorly absorbed.
