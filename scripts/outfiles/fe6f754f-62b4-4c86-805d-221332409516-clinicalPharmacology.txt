                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The mechanism of action of acamprosate in maintenance of alcohol abstinence is not completely understood. Chronic alcohol exposure is hypothesized to alter the normal balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. and studies in animals have provided evidence to suggest acamprosate may interact with glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems centrally, and has led to the hypothesis that acamprosate restores this balance.

                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that acamprosate calcium reduces alcohol intake in alcohol-dependent animals in a dose-dependent manner and that this effect appears to be specific to alcohol and the mechanisms of alcohol dependence.
                        Acamprosate calcium has negligible observable central nervous system (CNS) activity in animals outside of its effects on alcohol dependence, exhibiting no anticonvulsant, antidepressant, or anxiolytic activity.
                        The administration of acamprosate calcium is not associated with the development of tolerance or dependence in animal studies.  Campral did not produce any evidence of withdrawal symptoms in patients in clinical trials at therapeutic doses.  Post marketing data, collected retrospectively outside the U.S. have provided no evidence of Campral abuse or dependence.
                        Campral is not known to cause alcohol aversion and does not cause a disulfiram-like reaction as a result of ethanol ingestion.

                              The absolute bioavailability of Campral after oral administration is about 11%.  Steady-state plasma concentrations of acamprosate are reached within 5 days of dosing.  Steady-state peak plasma concentrations after Campral doses of 2 x 333 mg tablets three times daily average 350 ng/mL and occur at 3-8 hours post-dose.  Coadministration of Campral with food decreases bioavailability as measured by C and AUC, by approximately 42% and 23%, respectively.  The food effect on absorption is not clinically significant and no adjustment of dose is necessary.

Plasma protein binding of acamprosate is negligible.

Following oral administration of Campral, the major route of excretion is via the kidneys as acamprosate.

                                    The pharmacokinetics of Campral have not been evaluated in a geriatric population. However, since renal function diminishes in elderly patients and acamprosate is excreted unchanged in urine, acamprosate plasma concentrations are likely to be higher in the elderly population compared to younger adults.

Similarly, elimination half-life was about 1.8-fold and 2.6-fold longer, respectively, compared to healthy subjects.  There is a linear relationship between creatinine clearance values and total apparent plasma clearance, renal clearance and plasma half-life of acamprosate.  A dose of 1 x 333 mg Campral, three times daily, is recommended in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/min, [ ].

                              Acamprosate had no inducing potential on the cytochrome CYP1A2 and 3A4 systems, and inhibition studies suggest that acamprosate does not inhibit metabolism mediated by cytochrome CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4.  The pharmacokinetics of Campral were unaffected when co-administered with alcohol, disulfiram or diazepam.  Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of ethanol, diazepam and nordiazepam, imipramine and desipramine, naltrexone and 6-beta naltrexol were unaffected following co-administration with Campral.  However, co-administration of Campral with naltrexone led to a 33% increase in the C and a 25% increase in the AUC of acamprosate.  No adjustment of dosage is recommended in such patients.
