                     12.1  Mechanism of Action

                     
                        Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent when administered systemically.

                        In patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, cyclosporine emulsion is thought to act as a partial immunomodulator. The exact mechanism of action is not known.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3  Pharmacokinetics

                     
                        Blood cyclosporine A concentrations were measured using a specific high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay. Blood concentrations of cyclosporine, in all the samples collected, after topical administration of RESTASIS
                           ® 0.05%, twice daily, in humans for up to 12 months, were below the quantitation limit of 0.1 ng/mL. There was no detectable drug accumulation in blood during 12 months of treatment with RESTASIS
                           ® ophthalmic emulsion.
