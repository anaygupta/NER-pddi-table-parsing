                        The pharmacodynamics of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of acne are unknown.

                        Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not bioequivalent to non-modified release minocycline products. Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed Tmax at 3.5 to 4  hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (Tmax at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0–24) and Cmax were 33.32 mcg×hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 46.35 mcg×hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both products.

                           
A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics.

                           
When minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.

                           
Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum.
