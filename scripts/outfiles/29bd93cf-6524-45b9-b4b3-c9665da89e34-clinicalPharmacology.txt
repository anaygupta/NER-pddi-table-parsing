 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic originally isolated from Streptomyces venezuelae.  It is primarily bacteriostatic and acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by interfering with the transfer of activated amino acids from soluble RNA to ribosomes.  Development of resistance to chloramphenicol can be regarded as minimal for staphylococci and many other species of bacteria.Streptomyces venezuelae.
