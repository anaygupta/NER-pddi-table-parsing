                  Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking 
properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. 
Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.
                  Antagonism has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin in vitro. Because of possible clinical significance, these 
two drugs should not be administered concurrently.
                  
                  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
FertilityLong term studies in animals have not been performed with 
clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed 
included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both 
tests were negative.
                  Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 1.6 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on 
mg/m2) revealed no effects on fertility or mating 
ability.
