                  Hydrocortisone Acetate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. While the mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity is unclear, there is evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in humans.  Iodoquinol has both antifungal and antibacterial properties.

                        The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical steroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier and the use of occlusive dressings.  Hydrocortisone Acetate can be absorbed from normal intact skin.  Inflammation and/or other inflammatory disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption.  Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids.  Once absorbed through the skin, Hydrocortisone Acetate is metabolized in the liver and most body tissue to hydrogenated and degraded forms such as tetrahydrocortisone and tetrahydrocortisol.  These are excreted in the urine, mainly conjugated as glucuronides, together with a very small proportion of unchanged Hydrocortisone Acetate.  There are no data available regarding the percutaneous absorption of Iodoquinol; however, following oral administration, 3-5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as a glucuronide.
