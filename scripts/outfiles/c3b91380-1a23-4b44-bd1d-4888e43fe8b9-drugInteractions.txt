                             Inhibitors or inducers of CYP1A2: May alter the clearance of ropinirole; dose adjustment may be required (7.1, 12.3) 
                             Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): Starting or stopping HRT may require dose adjustment of ropinirole (7.2, 12.3) 
                             Dopamine antagonists (e.g., neuroleptics, metoclopramide): May reduce efficacy of ropinirole (7.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.1 CYP1A2 Inhibitors and Inducers
                     
                        
                           In vitro metabolism studies showed that CYP1A2 is the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ropinirole. There is thus the potential for inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme to alter the clearance of ropinirole. Therefore, if therapy with a drug known to be a potent inducer or inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole, adjustment of the dose of ropinirole may be required. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, increases the AUC and Cmax of ropinirole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cigarette smoking is expected to increase the clearance of ropinirole since CYP1A2 is known to be induced by smoking [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.2 Estrogens
                     
                        Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that higher doses of estrogens (usually associated with hormone replacement therapy [HRT]) reduced the clearance of ropinirole. Starting or stopping HRT may require adjustment of dosage of ropinirole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.3 Dopamine Antagonists
                     
                        Because ropinirole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists such as neuroleptics (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide may reduce the efficacy of ropinirole.
