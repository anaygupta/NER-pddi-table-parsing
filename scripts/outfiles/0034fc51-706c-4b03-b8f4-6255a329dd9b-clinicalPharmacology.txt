                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Emergency contraceptive pills are not effective if a woman is already pregnant. Levonorgestrel is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization (by altering tubal transport of sperm and/or ova). In addition, it may inhibit implantation (by altering the endometrium). It is not effective once the process of implantation has begun.

                           Absorption
                           
Following a single dose administration of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg in 30 women under fasting conditions, maximum plasma concentrations of levonorgestrel of 19.1 ng/mL were reached at 1.7 hours. See Table 2.
                        


                        


Cmax = maximum concentration
AUCt = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration
AUCinf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity
Tmax = time to maximum concentration
t1/2 = elimination half life
*N = 29
**median (range)
                        Effect of Food: The effect of food on the rate and the extent of levonorgestrel absorption following single oral administration of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg has not been evaluated.
                        
                           Distribution
                           
The apparent volume of distribution of levonorgestrel is reported to be approximately 1.8 L/kg. It is about 97.5 to 99% protein-bound, principally to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and, to a lesser extent, serum albumin.
                        
                           Metabolism
                           
Following absorption, levonorgestrel is conjugated at the 17β-OH position to form sulfate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, glucuronide conjugates in plasma. Significant amounts of conjugated and unconjugated 3α, 5β-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel are also present in plasma, along with much smaller amounts of 3α, 5α-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16βhydroxylevonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users.
                        
                           Excretion
                           
About 45% of levonorgestrel and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and about 32% are excreted in feces, mostly as glucuronide conjugates.

No formal studies have evaluated the effect of race. However, clinical trials demonstrated a higher pregnancy rate in Chinese women with both levonorgestrel tablets and the Yuzpe regimen (another form of emergency contraception). There was a non-statistically significant increased rate of pregnancy among Chinese women in the levonorgestrel tablet trial. The reason for this apparent increase in the pregnancy rate with emergency contraceptives in Chinese women is unknown [see
