                   Sectral is a cardioselective, β-adrenoreceptor blocking
							agent, which possesses mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) in
							its therapeutically effective dose range. 
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacodynamics
                     
                         β1-cardioselectivity has been
									demonstrated in experimental animal studies. In anesthetized
									dogs and cats, Sectral is more potent in antagonizing
									isoproterenol-induced tachycardia (β1) than
									in antagonizing isoproterenol-induced vasodilatation
										(β2).In guinea pigs and cats, it is more
									potent in antagonizing this tachycardia than in antagonizing
									isoproterenol- induced bronchodilatation
									(β2). ISA of Sectral has been demonstrated
									in catecholamine-depleted rats by tachycardia induced by
									intravenous administration of this agent. A membrane-stabilizing
									effect has been detected in animals, but only with high
									concentrations of Sectral. 
                        Clinical studies have demonstrated
									β1-blocking activity at the recommended
									doses by: a) reduction in the resting heart rate and decrease in
									exercise-induced tachycardia; b) reduction in cardiac output at
									rest and after exercise; c) reduction of systolic and diastolic
									blood pressures at rest and postexercise; d) inhibition of
									isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. 
                         The β1-selectivity of Sectral has
									also been demonstrated on the basis of the following vascular
									and bronchial effects: 
                        Vascular Effects: Sectral has less antagonistic effects
									on peripheral vascular β2-receptors at rest
									and after epinephrine stimulation than nonselective
									β-antagonists. 
                        Bronchial Effects: In single-dose studies in asthmatics
									examining effects of various beta-blockers on pulmonary
									function, low doses of acebutolol produce less evidence of
									bronchoconstriction and less reduction of beta2
									agonist, bronchodilating effects, than nonselective agents like
									propranolol but more than atenolol. 
                         ISA has been observed with Sectral in man, as shown by a
									slightly smaller (about 3 beats per minute) decrease in resting
									heart rate when compared to equivalent β-blocking doses
									of propranolol, metoprolol or atenolol. Chronic therapy with
									Sectral induced no significant alteration in the blood lipid
									profile. 
                         Sectral has been shown to delay AV conduction time and
									to increase the refractoriness of the AV node without
									significantly affecting sinus node recovery time, atrial
									refractory period, or the HV conduction time. The
									membrane-stabilizing effect of Sectral is not manifest at the
									doses used clinically. 
                         Significant reductions in resting and exercise heart
									rates and systolic blood pressures have been observed 1.5 hours
									after Sectral administration with maximal effects occurring
									between 3 and 8 hours postdosing in normal volunteers. Sectral
									has demonstrated a significant effect on exercise-induced
									tachycardia 24 to 30 hours after drug administration. 
                        There are significant correlations between plasma levels
									of acebutolol and both the reduction in resting heart rate and
									the percent of β-blockade of exercise-induced
									tachycardia. 
                        The antihypertensive effect of Sectral has been shown in
									double-blind controlled studies to be superior to placebo and
									similar to propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide. In addition,
									patients responding to Sectral administered twice daily had a
									similar response whether the dosage regimen was changed to once
									daily administration or continued on a b.i.d. regimen. Most
									patients responded to 400 to 800 mg per day in divided doses. 
                         The antiarrhythmic effect of Sectral was compared with
									placebo, propranolol, and quinidine. Compared with placebo,
									Sectral significantly reduced mean total ventricular ectopic
									beats (VEB), paired VEB, multiform VEB, R-on-T beats, and
									ventricular tachycardia (VT). Both Sectral and propranolol
									significantly reduced mean total and paired VEB and VT. Sectral
									and quinidine significantly reduced resting total and complex
									VEB; the antiarrhythmic efficacy of Sectral was also observed
									during exercise. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
                     
                         Sectral is well absorbed from the GI tract. It is
									subject to extensive first-pass hepatic biotransformation, with
									an absolute bioavailability of approximately 40% for the parent
									compound. The major metabolite, an N-acetyl derivative
									(diacetolol), is pharmacologically active. This metabolite is
									equipotent to Sectral and in cats is more cardioselective than
									Sectral; therefore, this first-pass phenomenon does not
									attenuate the therapeutic effect of Sectral. Food intake does
									not have a significant effect on the area under the plasma
									concentration-time curve (AUC) of Sectral although the rate of
									absorption and peak concentration decreased slightly. 
                         The plasma elimination half-life of Sectral is
									approximately 3 to 4 hours, while that of its metabolite,
									diacetolol, is 8 to 13 hours. The time to reach peak
									concentration for Sectral is 2.5 hours and for diacetolol, after
									oral administration of Sectral, 3.5 hours. 
                         Within the single oral dose range of 200 to 400 mg, the
									kinetics are dose proportional. However, this linearity is not
									seen at higher doses, probably due to saturation of hepatic
									biotransformation sites. In addition, after multiple dosing the
									lack of linearity is also seen by AUC increases of approximately
									100% as compared to single oral dosing. Elimination via renal
									excretion is approximately 30% to 40% and by nonrenal mechanisms
									50% to 60%, which includes excretion into the bile and direct
									passage through the intestinal wall. 
                         Sectral has a low binding affinity for plasma proteins
									(about 26%). Sectral and its metabolite, diacetolol, are
									relatively hydrophilic and, therefore, only minimal quantities
									have been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
                         Drug interaction studies with tolbutamide and warfarin
									indicated no influence on the therapeutic effects of these
									compounds. Digoxin and hydrochlorothiazide plasma levels were
									not affected by concomitant Sectral administration. The kinetics
									of Sectral were not significantly altered by concomitant
									administration of hydrochlorothiazide, hydralazine,
									sulfinpyrazone, or oral contraceptives. 
                         In patients with renal impairment, there is no effect on
									the elimination half-life of Sectral, but there is decreased
									elimination of the metabolite, diacetolol, resulting in a two-
									to three-fold increase in its half-life. For this reason, the
									drug should be administered with caution in patients with renal
									insufficiency (see 
                              PRECAUTIONS
                           ). Sectral and its major metabolite are dialyzable. 
                        Sectral crosses the placental barrier and is secreted in
									breast milk. 
                        In geriatric patients, the bioavailability of Sectral and
									its metabolite is increased, approximately two-fold, probably
									due to decreases in the first-pass metabolism and renal function
									in the elderly.
