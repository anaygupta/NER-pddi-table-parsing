                  	Studies indicate allergic individuals produce immunoglobulins of the IgE class in response to exposure to allergens.  Subsequent exposure to the allergen results in a combination of allergen with IgE antibody fixed on mast cells or basophil membranes.  This cross-linking results in stimulation of mast cell which leads to release and generation of pharmacologically active substances that produce immediate hypersensitivity reaction.3
                  
                  	The mode of action of immunotherapy with allergenic extracts is still under investigation.  Subcutaneous injections of increasing doses of allergenic extract into patients with allergic disease have been shown to result in both humoral and cellular changes including the production of allergen-specific IgG antibodies, the suppression of histamine release from target cells, decrease in circulating levels of antigen specific IgE antibody over long periods of time and suppression of peripheral blood T-lymphocyte cell responses to antigen.10, 14, 15
