                  Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects.  Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. 
                  Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action.  Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection is not available.
