                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Following intra-arterial administration of Lipiodol, ethiodized oil retained in normal hepatic parenchyma is phagocytized by the Kupffer cells of the liver and washed out via the hepatic lymphatic system in about 2 to 4 weeks. In HCC, retention in the liver tumor is prolonged, allowing re-imaging of the tumor for four weeks or longer.
