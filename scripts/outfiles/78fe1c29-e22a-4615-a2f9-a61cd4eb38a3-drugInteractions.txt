                            Some drugs (e.g., diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) increase risk due to fluid and electrolyte changes (7.1)
                            Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of drinking GaviLyte - H might not be absorbed fully. (7.2)
                            Do not take the bisacodyl tablet within one hour of taking antacid (7.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                        7.1 Drugs That May Increase Risks of Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities

                     
                     
                        Use caution when prescribing GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP for patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Consider additional patient evaluations as appropriate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] in patients taking these concomitant medications.
