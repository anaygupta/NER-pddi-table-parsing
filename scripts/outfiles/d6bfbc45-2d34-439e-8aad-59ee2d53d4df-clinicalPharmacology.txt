                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Pompe disease (acid maltase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type II, GSD II, glycogenosis type II) is an inherited disorder of glycogen metabolism caused by the absence or marked deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme GAA.
                        Alglucosidase alfa provides an exogenous source of GAA. Binding to mannose-6-phosphate receptors on the cell surface has been shown to occur via carbohydrate groups on the GAA molecule, after which it is internalized and transported into lysosomes, where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage that results in increased enzymatic activity. It then exerts enzymatic activity in cleaving glycogen.

                        Clinical pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted for alglucosidase alfa.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of alglucosidase alfa were evaluated in 13 patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease, aged 1 month to 7 months, who received 20 mg/kg (approximately as a 4-hour infusion) or 40 mg/kg (approximately as a 6.5-hour infusion) of alglucosidase alfa every 2 weeks.  The measurement of alglucosidase alfa plasma concentration was based on an activity assay using an artificial substrate.  Systemic exposure was approximately dose proportional between the 20 and 40 mg/kg doses.  Based on the pharmacokinetic blood samples collected for 12 hours after a 4-hour intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg (n=5), the estimated mean AUC was 811 mcg∙hr/mL with 17% coefficient of variation [CV], Cmax was 162 mcg/mL with 19% CV, clearance was 25 mL/hr/kg with 16% CV, and half-life was 2.3 hours with 17% CV.  
                        The pharmacokinetics of alglucosidase alfa were also evaluated in a separate trial of 14 patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease, aged 6 months to 3.5 years, who received 20 mg/kg of alglucosidase alfa as a 4-hour infusion every 2 weeks.  The pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those observed for the infantile-onset Pompe disease patients aged 1 month to 7 months who received the 20 mg/kg dose.  
                        Nineteen of 21 patients who received treatment with alglucosidase alfa and had pharmacokinetics and antibody titer data available at Week 12 developed antibodies to alglucosidase alfa.  Five patients with antibody titers ≥ 12,800 at Week 12 had an average increase in clearance of 50% (range 5% to 90%) from Week 1 to Week 12.  The other 14 patients with antibody titers < 12,800 at Week 12 had similar average clearance values at Week 1 and Week 12.
