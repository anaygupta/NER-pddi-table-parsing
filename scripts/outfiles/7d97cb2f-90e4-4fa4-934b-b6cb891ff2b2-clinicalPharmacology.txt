               Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals is a larger crystal form of nitrofurantoin. The absorption of nitrofurantoin macrocrystals is slower and its excretion somewhat less when compared to nitrofurantoin. Blood concentrations at therapeutic dosage are usually low. It is highly soluble in urine, to which it may impart a brown color.
Following a dose regimen of 100 mg q.i.d. for 7 days, average urinary drug recoveries (0 to 24 hours) on day 1 and day 7 were 37.9% and 35%.
Unlike many drugs, the presence of food or agents delaying gastric emptying can increase the bioavailability of nitrofurantoin macrocrystals, presumably by allowing better dissolution in gastric juices.
