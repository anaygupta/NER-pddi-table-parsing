                  In sensitive persons, allergenic extract elicits immediate-type skin reactions consisting of erythema and edema at the test site. This allergic inflammatory response is thought to begin with the reaction of allergen with immunoglobulin E (IgE) on the surface of the mast cell. This antigen-antibody reaction initiates a series of biochemical events that result in the release of histamine and other mediators from the mast cell. These mediators are responsible for the characteristic wheal and flare response associated with a positive skin test. The initial antigen-antibody reaction appears to be a specific response that is dependent upon the presence of allergen-specific IgE attached to the mast cell2,3.

	Delayed-type reactions occur in some individuals following the intradermal administration of Trichophyton extract. This response is due to the presence of sensitized lymphocytes. The reaction is characterized by erythema and induration that peaks between 24 and 48 hours after skin testing4.
