                  Morphine is the principal narcotic alkaloid of opium, from which it differs somewhat in its mode of action. Its effects are remarkably diverse and include analgesia, drowsiness, changes in mood, mental clouding, respiratory depression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, and alterations of the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems. Its most important actions are on the brain, especially its higher functions. An initial transitory stimulation is followed by depression of the brain, its higher functions and medullary centers. Other actions include depression of the cough center, release of antidiuretic hormone, pupillary constriction, increase in biliary tract pressure, sedation with muscle relaxation, decreased physical activity, lassitude, increased tone of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, mild vasodilation, and an increased amplitude of ureteral contractions.
                  Opioids act as agonists, interacting with stereospecific and saturable binding sites or receptors in the brain and other tissues.
                  Morphine is about two-thirds absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with the maximum analgesic effect occurring 60 minutes post administration. Onset of analgesia following intramuscular or subcutaneous administration occurs within 10 to 30 minutes. The effect persists for 4 to 5 hours.
                  Approximately 90% of a parenteral dose of morphine appears in the urine within 24 hours as the product of glucuronide conjugation. Most of the remainder is excreted in the bile and eliminated in the feces.
