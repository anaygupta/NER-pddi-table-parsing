                        Flecainide has been administered to patients receiving preparations or without adverse effects. During administration of multiple oral doses of flecainide to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of , a 13% to 19% increase in plasma levels occurred at six hours postdose.

                        In a study involving healthy subjects receiving flecainide and concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and levels were increased about 30% compared to control values. In this formal interaction study, flecainide and were each found to have negative inotropic effects; when the drugs were administered together, the effects were additive. The effects of concomitant administration of flecainide and on the PR interval were less than additive. In flecainide clinical trials, patients who were receiving concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. Nevertheless, the possibility of additive negative inotropic effects of and flecainide should be recognized.

                        Flecainide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. studies with several drugs which may be administered concomitantly showed that the extent of flecainide binding to human plasma proteins is either unchanged or only slightly less. Consequently, interactions with other drugs which are highly protein bound (e.g., ) would not be expected. Flecainide has been used in a large number of patients receiving without apparent interaction. Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of flecainide elimination. In healthy subjects receiving (1 gm daily) for one week, plasma flecainide levels increased by about 30% and half-life increased by about 10%.

                        Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450IID6, such as , might increase the plasma concentrations of flecainide in patients that are on chronic flecainide therapy; especially if these patients are extensive metabolizers.

                        There has been little experience with the coadministration of flecainide and either or . Because both of these drugs have negative inotropic properties and the effects of coadministration with flecainide are unknown, neither nor should be administered concurrently with flecainide unless, in the judgment of the physician, the benefits of this combination outweigh the risks. There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide with or to recommend concomitant use.
