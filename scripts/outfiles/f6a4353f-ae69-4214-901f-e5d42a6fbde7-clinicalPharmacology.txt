                        12.1  Mechanism of Action
                     
                     
                        Brimonidine is a relatively selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. Topical application of MIRVASO topical gel may reduce erythema through direct vasoconstriction.

                           Absorption
                        
                        The absorption of brimonidine from MIRVASO topical gel was evaluated in a clinical trial in 24 adult subjects with facial erythema associated with rosacea. All enrolled subjects received once daily topical application of MIRVASO topical gel 1 gram to the entire face for 29 days. Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed on Day 1, Day 15, and Day 29. The mean plasma maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were highest on Day 15, with Cmax and AUC values (± standard deviation) of 46 ± 62 pg/mL and 417 ± 264 pg.hr/mL, respectively. The systemic drug exposure was slightly lower on Day 29 indicating no further drug accumulation.
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        Brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver.
                        
                           Excretion
                        
                        Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites.
