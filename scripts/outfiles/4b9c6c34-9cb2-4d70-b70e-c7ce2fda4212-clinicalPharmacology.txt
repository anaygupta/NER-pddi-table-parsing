                  Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone.  Nitrogen balance is improved with anabolic agents but only when there is sufficient intake of calories and protein.  Whether this positive nitrogen balance is of primary benefit in the utilization of protein-building dietary substances has not been established.  Oxymetholone enhances the production and urinary excretion of erythropoietin in patients with anemias due to bone marrow failure and often stimulates erythropoiesis in anemias due to deficient red cell production.
                  Certain clinical effects and adverse reactions demonstrate the androgenic properties of this class of drugs.  Complete dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effects has not been achieved.  The actions of anabolic steroids are therefore similar to those of male sex hormones with the possibility of causing serious disturbances of growth and sexual development if given to young children.  They suppress the gonadotropic functions of the pituitary and may exert a direct effect upon the testes.
