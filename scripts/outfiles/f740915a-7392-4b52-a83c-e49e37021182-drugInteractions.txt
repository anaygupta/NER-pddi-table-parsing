                        Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents. Caution should be exercised in using preparation containing sulfur, resorcinol or salicylic acid in combination with adapalene lotion.
                        No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with adapalene lotion.
