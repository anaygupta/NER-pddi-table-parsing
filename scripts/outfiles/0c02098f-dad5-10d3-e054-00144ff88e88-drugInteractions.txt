                  Interaction with Potassium Sparing Diuretics: Hypokalemia should not be treated by the concomitant administration of potassium salts and potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene or amiloride) since the simultaneous administration of these agents can produce severe hyperkalemia. Interaction with ACE inhibitors: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g., captopril, enlapril) will produce some potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Potassium supplements should be given to patients receiving ACE inhibitors only with close monitoring. 
                  
                     TOXICITY: Hyperkalemia when detected, must be treated immediately because lethal levels can be reached in a few hours. Dispense in tight, light-resistant container as defined in USP/NF. Store at 20-25
  ºC (66
  º to 77
  ºF) Avoid Freezing.
