                           Coumarin anticoagulants:      Concomitant use with simvastatin prolongs INR. Achieve stable INR prior to      starting simvastatin. Monitor INR frequently until stable upon initiation      or alteration of simvastatin therapy.

                     7.1 Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors, Cyclosporine, or Danazol Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                     
                        Simvastatin, like several other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, is a substrate of CYP3A4. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4 but has no CYP3A4 inhibitory activity; therefore it is not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. 
                        Elevated plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, particularly with higher doses of simvastatin [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 
                        Concomitant use of drugs labeled as having a strong inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 is contraindicated [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. If treatment with itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin or telithromycin is unavoidable, therapy with simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment.

                        The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of cyclosporine or danazol Therefore, concomitant use of these drugs is contraindicated. [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

                        The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of amiodarone, dronedarone, ranolazine, or calcium channel blockers such as verapamil, diltiazem, or amlodipine [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) AND WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)

                        Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been observed with simvastatin coadministered with lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day niacin) of niacin-containing products. In particular, caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with simvastatin doses exceeding 20 mg/day coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products. Because the risk for myopathy is dose-related, Chinese patients should not receive simvastatin 80 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.5 Digoxin
                     
                        In one study, concomitant administration of digoxin with simvastatin resulted in a slight elevation in digoxin concentrations in plasma. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately when simvastatin is initiated [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.6 Coumarin Anticoagulants
                     
                        In two clinical studies, one in normal volunteers and the other in hypercholesterolemic patients, simvastatin 20 to 40 mg/day modestly potentiated the effect of coumarin anticoagulants: the prothrombin time, reported as International Normalized Ratio (INR), increased from a baseline of 1.7 to 1.8 and from 2.6 to 3.4 in the volunteer and patient studies, respectively. With other statins, clinically evident bleeding and/or increased prothrombin time has been reported in a few patients taking coumarin anticoagulants concomitantly. In such patients, prothrombin time should be determined before starting simvastatin and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occurs. Once a stable prothrombin time has been documented, prothrombin times can be monitored at the intervals usually recommended for patients on coumarin anticoagulants. If the dose of simvastatin is changed or discontinued, the same procedure should be repeated. Simvastatin therapy has not been associated with bleeding or with changes in prothrombin time in patients not taking anticoagulants.

                        Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with simvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing simvastatin with colchicine.
