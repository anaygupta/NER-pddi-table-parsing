                  When floxuridine is given by rapid intra-arterial injection it is apparently rapidly catabolized to 5-fluorouracil.  Thus, rapid injection of floxuridine produces the same toxic and antimetabolic effects as does 5-fluorouracil.  The primary effect is to interfere with the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and to a lesser extent inhibit the formation of ribonucleic acid (RNA).  However, when floxuridine is given by continuous intra-arterial infusion its direct anabolism to floxuridine-monophosphate is enhanced, thus increasing the inhibition of DNA.
                  Floxuridine is metabolized in the liver.  The drug is excreted intact and as urea, fluorouracil, α-fluoro-β-ureidopropionic acid, dihydrofluorouracil, α-fluoro-β-guanidopropionic acid and α-fluoro-β-alanine in the urine; it is also expired as respiratory carbon dioxide.  Pharmacokinetic data on intra-arterial infusion of floxuridine are not available.
