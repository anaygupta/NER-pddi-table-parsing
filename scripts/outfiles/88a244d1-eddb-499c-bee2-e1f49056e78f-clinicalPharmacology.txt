                     12.1. Mechanism of Action

                     
                        The mechanism of action of lurasidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown.  It has been suggested that the efficacy of lurasidone in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2. Pharmacodynamics

                     
                        In vitro receptor binding studies revealed that lurasidone is an antagonist with high affinity at dopamine D2 receptors (Ki = 0.994 nM) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) receptors 5-HT2A (Ki = 0.47 nM) and 5-HT7 (Ki = 0.495 nM), is an antagonist with moderate affinity at human α2C adrenergic receptors (Ki = 10.8 nM), is a partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT1A (Ki = 6.38 nM) receptors, and is an antagonist at α2A adrenergic receptors (Ki = 40.7 nM).  Lurasidone exhibits little or no affinity for histamine H1 and muscarinic M1 receptors (IC50 ≥ 1,000 nM and > 1,000 nM, respectively).

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3. Pharmacokinetics

                     
                        The activity of lurasidone is primarily due to the parent drug.  The pharmacokinetics of lurasidone is dose-proportional within a total daily dose range of 20 mg to 160 mg.  Steady-state concentrations of lurasidone are reached within 7 days of starting LATUDA. 

                        Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) elimination half-life was 18 (7) hours.  

                        
                           Absorption and Distribution: Lurasidone is absorbed and reaches peak serum concentrations in approximately 1-3 hours.  It is estimated that 9-19% of an administered dose is absorbed.  Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution was 6173 (17.2) L.  Lurasidone is highly bound (~99%) to serum proteins.

                        In a food effect study, lurasidone mean Cmax and AUC were about 3-times and 2-times, respectively, when administered with food compared to the levels observed under fasting conditions.  Lurasidone exposure was not affected as meal size was increased from 350 to 1000 calories and was independent of meal fat content [see Dosage and Administration (
                           
                              2.2
                           
                           )].

                        In clinical studies, establishing the safety and efficacy of LATUDA, patients were instructed to take their daily dose with food [see Dosage and Administration (
                           
                              2.2
                           
                           )].

                        
                           Metabolism and Elimination: Lurasidone is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4. The major biotransformation pathways are oxidative N-dealkylation, hydroxylation of norbornane ring, and S-oxidation.  Lurasidone is metabolized into two active metabolites (ID-14283 and ID-14326) and two major non-active metabolites (ID-20219 and ID-20220).

                        Total excretion of radioactivity in urine and feces combined was approximately 89%, with about 80% recovered in feces and 9% recovered in urine, after a single dose of [14C]-labeled lurasidone.

                        Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) apparent clearance was 3902 (18.0) mL/min.
