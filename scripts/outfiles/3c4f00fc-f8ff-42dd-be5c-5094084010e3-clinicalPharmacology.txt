               CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYThyroid hormone synthesis and secretion is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone(TRH) released from the hypothalamus stimulates secretion of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone, TSH, from the anterior pituitary.TSH, in turn, is the physiologic stimulus for the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones, L-thyroxine (T4) and L-triiodothyronine(T3), by the thyroid gland. Circulating serum T3 and T4 levels exert a feedback effect on both TRH and TSH secretion. When serumT3 and T4 levels increase, TRH and TSH secretion decrease. When thyroid hormone levels decrease, TRH and TSH secretionincrease.The mechanisms by which thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions are not completely understood, but it is thought that theirprincipal effects are exerted through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. T3 and T4 diffuse into the cell nucleus andbind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesisof messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. page 2 of 12 Thyroid hormones regulate multiple metabolic processes and play an essential role in normal growth and development, and normalmaturation of the central nervous system and bone. The metabolic actions of thyroid hormones include augmentation of cellularrespiration and thermogenesis, as well as metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. The protein anabolic effects of thyroidhormones are essential to normal growth and development.The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) isderived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues.Levothyroxine, at doses individualized according to patient response, is effective as replacement or supplemental therapy inhypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis.Levothyroxine is also effective in the suppression of pituitary TSH secretion in the treatment or prevention of various typesof euthyroid goiters, including thyroid nodules, Hashimoto222s thyroiditis, multinodular goiter and, as adjunctive therapyin the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer (seeINDICATIONS AND USAGE,
