                              Other Antihypertensive Drugs

                              Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins
                           
                           
                              Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.

                              Possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Lithium
                           
                           
                              Generally should not be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with hydrochlorothiazide.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs
                           
                           
                              In some patients, the administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when hydrochlorothiazide and nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
