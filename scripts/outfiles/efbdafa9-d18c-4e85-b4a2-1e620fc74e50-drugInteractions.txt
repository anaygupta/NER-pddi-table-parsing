                              The AUC of idelalisib was reduced by 75% when Zydelig was coadministered with a strong CYP3A inducer. Avoid coadministration of Zydelig with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, phenytoin, St. John's wort, or carbamazepine

                              The AUC of idelalisib was increased 1.8-fold when Zydelig was coadministered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor 
           
 
  [see

   If patients are taking concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for signs of Zydelig toxicity

                              Zydelig is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. The AUC of a sensitive CYP3A substrate was increased 5.4-fold when Zydelig was coadministered with a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Avoid coadministration of Zydelig with CYP3A substrates
