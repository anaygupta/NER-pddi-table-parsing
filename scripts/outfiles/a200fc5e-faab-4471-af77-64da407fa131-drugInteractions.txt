                           MAOI antidepressants are contraindicated; MAOIs potentiate the effects of amphetamine. Do not administer MAS-ER Capsules during or within 14 days after use of MAOI. (

                           MAO Inhibitors
                        
                        MAOI antidepressants slow amphetamine metabolism. This slowing potentiates amphetamines, increasing their effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings; this can cause headaches and other signs of hypertensive crisis. A variety of toxic neurological effects and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur, sometimes with fatal results. Do not administer MAS-ER Capsules during or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors [see 
                           
                              CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].
                        
                           Alkalinizing Agents
                        
                        Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) increase absorption of amphetamines. Co-administration of MAS-ER Capsules and gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents, such as antacids, should be avoided. Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents increase blood levels and therefore potentiate the actions of amphetamines.

                           Acidifying Agents
                        
                        Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (e.g., guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid) lower absorption of amphetamines. Urinary acidifying agents (e.g., ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, methenamine salts) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.

                           Antidepressants, Tricyclic
                        
                        Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic antidepressants or sympathomimetic agents; d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated.

                        Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines.
                        
                           Haloperidol

                           Propoxyphene Overdosage
                        
                        In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.7 Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)
                     
                        PPIs act on proton pumps by blocking acid production, thereby reducing gastric acidity. When MAS-ER Capsules (20 mg single-dose) was administered concomitantly with the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole (40 mg once daily for 14 days), the median Tmax of d-amphetamine was decreased by 1.25 hours (from 4 to 2.75 hours), and the median Tmax of l-amphetamine was decreased by 2.5 hours (from 5.5 to 3 hours), compared to MAS-ER Capsules administered alone. The AUC and Cmax of each moiety were unaffected. Therefore, co-administration of MAS-ER Capsules and proton pump inhibitors should be monitored for changes in clinical effect.

                        Amphetamines can cause a significant elevation in plasma corticosteroid levels. This increase is greatest in the evening. Amphetamines may interfere with urinary steroid determinations.
