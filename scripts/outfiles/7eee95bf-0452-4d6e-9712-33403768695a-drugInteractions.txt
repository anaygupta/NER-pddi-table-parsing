                   Catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine, may have an
							additive effect when given with β-blocking agents. Patients
							treated with Sectral plus catecholamine depletors should, therefore, be
							observed closely for evidence of marked bradycardia or hypotension which
							may present as vertigo, syncope/presyncope, or orthostatic changes in
							blood pressure without compensatory tachycardia. Exaggerated
							hypertensive responses have been reported from the combined use of
							β-adrenergic antagonists and α-adrenergic stimulants,
							including those contained in proprietary cold remedies and
							vasoconstrictive nasal drops. Patients receiving β-blockers
							should be warned of this potential hazard. 
                   Blunting of the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor
							blocking agents by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been
							reported.
                   No significant interactions with digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide,
							hydralazine, sulfinpyrazone, oral contraceptives, tolbutamide, or
							warfarin have been observed. 
                   Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow
							atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can
							increase the risk of bradycardia.
