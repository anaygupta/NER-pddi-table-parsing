                            MAO inhibitors: Silenor should not be administered in patients on MAOIs within the past two weeks. (4.2)
                            Cimetidine: Increases exposure to doxepin. (7.2)
                            Alcohol:  Sedative effects may be increased with doxepin. (7.3, 5.4)
                            CNS Depressants and Sedating Antihistamines: Sedative effects may be increased with doxepin. (7.4, 5.4)
                            Tolazamide: A case of severe hypoglycemia has been reported. (7.5)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1.	Cytochrome P450 Isozymes
                     
                        Silenor is primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent, by CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. Inhibitors of these isozymes may increase the exposure of doxepin. Silenor is not an inhibitor of any CYP isozymes at therapeutically relevant concentrations. The ability of Silenor to induce CYP isozymes is not known.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2.	Cimetidine 
                     
                        Silenor exposure is doubled with concomitant administration of cimetidine, a nonspecific inhibitor of CYP isozymes. A maximum dose of 3 mg is recommended in adults and elderly when cimetidine is co-administered with Silenor [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3.	Alcohol
                     
                        When taken with Silenor, the sedative effects of alcohol may be potentiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4)
                           ].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4.	CNS Depressants and Sedating Antihistamines
                     
                        When taken with Silenor, the sedative effects of sedating antihistamines and CNS depressants may be potentiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4)
                           ].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5.	Tolazamide
                     
                        A case of severe hypoglycemia has been reported in a type II diabetic patient maintained on tolazamide (1 g/day) 11 days after the addition of oral doxepin (75 mg/day).
