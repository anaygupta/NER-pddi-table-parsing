                  A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total cholesterol (total-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B (apo B), an LDL membrane complex, are associated with human atherosclerosis.  Similarly, decreased levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and its transport complex, apolipoprotein A (apo AI and apo AII) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis.  Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of total-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides, and inversely with the level of HDL-C.  The independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering triglycerides (TG) on the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

                  Fenofibric acid, the active metabolite of fenofibrate, produces reductions in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, total triglycerides and triglyceride rich lipoprotein (VLDL) in treated patients.  In addition, treatment with fenofibrate results in increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apoproteins apo AI and apo AII.

                  The effects of fenofibric acid seen in clinical practice have been explained in vivo in transgenic mice and in vitro in human hepatocyte cultures by the activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα).  Through this mechanism, fenofibrate increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of apoprotein C-III (an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase activity). The resulting fall in triglycerides produces an alteration in the size and composition of LDL from small, dense particles (which are thought to be atherogenic due to their susceptibility to oxidation), to large buoyant particles.  These larger particles have a greater affinity for cholesterol receptors and are catabolized rapidly.  Activation of PPARα also induces an increase in the synthesis of apoproteins AI, AII and HDL-cholesterol.

                  Fenofibrate also reduces serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemic and normal individuals by increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid.

               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics/Metabolism

                     
                        Plasma concentrations of fenofibric acid after administration of 54 mg and 160 mg tablets are equivalent under fed conditions to 67 and 200 mg capsules, respectively.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Absorption

                     
                        The absolute bioavailability of fenofibrate cannot be determined as the compound is virtually insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection.  However, fenofibrate is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, approximately 60% of a single dose of radiolabelled fenofibrate appeared in urine, primarily as fenofibric acid and its glucuronate conjugate, and 25% was excreted in the feces.  Peak plasma levels of fenofibric acid occur within 6 to 8 hours after administration.

                        The absorption of fenofibrate is increased when administered with food.  With fenofibrate tablets, the extent of absorption is increased by approximately 35% under fed as compared to fasting conditions.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Distribution

                     
                        In healthy volunteers, steady-state plasma levels of fenofibric acid were shown to be achieved within 5 days of dosing and did not demonstrate accumulation across time following multiple dose administration.  Serum protein binding was approximately 99% in normal and hyperlipidemic subjects.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Metabolism

                     
                        Following oral administration, fenofibrate is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases to the active metabolite, fenofibric acid; no unchanged fenofibrate is detected in plasma.

                        Fenofibric acid is primarily conjugated with glucuronic acid and then excreted in urine.  A small amount of fenofibric acid is reduced at the carbonyl moiety to a benzhydrol metabolite which is, in turn, conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine.

                        
                           In vivo metabolism data indicate that neither fenofibrate or fenofibric acid undergo oxidative metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450) to a significant extent.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Excretion

                     
                        After absorption, fenofibrate is mainly excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites, primarily fenofibric acid and fenofibric acid glucuronide.  After administration of radiolabelled fenofibrate, approximately 60% of the dose appeared in the urine and 25% was excreted in the feces.

                        Fenofibric acid is eliminated with a half-life of 20 hours, allowing once daily administration in a clinical setting.

                              In elderly volunteers 77–87 years of age, the oral clearance of fenofibric acid following a single oral dose of fenofibrate was 1.2 L/h, which compares to 1.1 L/h in young adults.  This indicates that a similar dosage regimen can be used in elderly, without increasing accumulation of the drug or metabolites.

                              Fenofibrate has not been investigated in adequate and well-controlled trials in pediatric patients.

                              No pharmacokinetic difference between males and females has been observed for fenofibrate.

                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Race

                           
                              The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of fenofibrate has not been studied, however fenofibrate is not metabolized by enzymes known for exhibiting inter-ethnic variability.  Therefore, inter-ethnic pharmacokinetic differences are very unlikely.

                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Renal Insufficiency

                           
                              In a study in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), the rate of clearance of fenofibric acid was greatly reduced, and the compound accumulated during chronic dosage.  However, in patients having moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 50 to 90 mL/min), the oral clearance and the oral volume of distribution of fenofibric acid are increased compared to healthy adults (2.1 L/h and 95 L versus 1.1 L/h and 30 L, respectively). Therefore, the dosage of Fenofibrate should be minimized in patients who have severe renal impairment, while no modification of dosage is required in patients having moderate renal impairment.

                                 In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that fenofibrate and fenofibric acid are not inhibitors of cytochrome (CYP) P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2.  They are weak inhibitors of CYP2C19 and CYP2A6, and mild-to-moderate inhibitors of CYP2C9 at therapeutic concentrations.

                              Potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulants has been observed with prolongation of the prothrombin time/INR.

                              Bile acid sequestrants have been shown to bind other drugs given concurrently.  Therefore, fenofibrate should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4–6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption (see

                              Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (160 mg) with pravastatin (40 mg) once daily for 10 days has been shown to increase the mean Cmax and AUC values for pravastatin by 36% (range from 69% decrease to 321% increase) and 28% (range from 54% decrease to 128% increase), respectively, and for 3α-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin by 55% (range from 32% decrease to 314% increase) and 39% (range from 24% decrease to 261% increase), respectively in 23 healthy adults. A single dose of pravastatin had no clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid. Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (160 mg) with atorvastatin (20 mg) once daily for 10 days resulted in approximately 17% decrease (range from 67% decrease to 44% increase) in atorvastatin AUC values in 22 healthy males. The atorvastatin Cmax values were not significantly affected by fenofibrate.  The pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid were not significantly affected by atorvastatin.

                              The effects of fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 160 mg fenofibrate per day were assessed from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group studies including patients with the following mean baseline lipid values: total-C 306.9 mg/dL; LDL-C 213.8 mg/dL; HDL-C 52.3 mg/dL; and triglycerides 191.0 mg/dL. Fenofibrate therapy lowered LDL-C, total-C, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio.  Fenofibrate therapy also lowered triglycerides and raised HDL-C (see 
                                    Table 1

In a subset of the subjects, measurements of apo B were conducted.

                              The effects of fenofibrate or serum triglycerides were studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials1 of 147 hypertriglyceridemic patients (Fredrickson Types IV and V).  Patients were treated for eight weeks under protocols that differed only in that one entered patients with baseline triglyceride (TG) levels of 500 to 1500 mg/dL, and the other TG levels of 350 to 500 mg/dL.  In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and normal cholesterolemia with or without hyperchylomicronemia (Type IV/V hyperlipidemia), treatment with fenofibrate at dosages equivalent to 160 mg fenofibrate per day decreased primarily very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol.  Treatment of patients with Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia and elevated triglycerides often results in an increase of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (see Table 2).
