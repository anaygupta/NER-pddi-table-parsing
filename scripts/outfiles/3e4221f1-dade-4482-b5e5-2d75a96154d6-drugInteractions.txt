                        Theophylline interacts with a wide variety of drugs. The
                                    interaction may be pharmacodynamic, i.e., alterations in the therapeutic response to
                                    theophylline or another drug or occurrence of adverse effects
                                    without a change in serum theophylline concentration. More
                                    frequently, however, the interaction is pharmacokinetic,
                                        i.e., the rate of
                                    theophylline clearance is altered by another drug resulting in
                                    increased or decreased serum theophylline concentrations.
                                    Theophylline only rarely alters the pharmacokinetics of other
                                    drugs.
                        The drugs listed in Table III have the potential to
                                    produce clinically significant pharmacodynamic or
                                    pharmacokinetic interactions with theophylline. The information
                                    in the “Effect” column of Table III assumes that the interacting
                                    drug is being added to a steady-state theophylline regimen. If
                                    theophylline is being initiated in a patient who is already
                                    taking a drug that inhibits theophylline clearance (e.g., cimetidine,
                                    erythromycin), the dose of theophylline required to achieve a
                                    therapeutic serum theophylline concentration will be smaller.
                                    Conversely, if theophylline is being initiated in a patient who
                                    is already taking a drug that enhances theophylline clearance
                                        (e.g., rifampin), the
                                    dose of theophylline required to achieve a therapeutic serum
                                    theophylline concentration will be larger. Discontinuation of a
                                    concomitant drug that increases theophylline clearance will
                                    result in accumulation of theophylline to potentially toxic
                                    levels, unless the theophylline dose is appropriately reduced.
                                    Discontinuation of a concomitant drug that inhibits theophylline
                                    clearance will result in decreased serum theophylline
                                    concentrations, unless the theophylline dose is appropriately
                                    increased.
                        The drugs listed in Table IV have either been documented
                                    not to interact with theophylline or do not produce a clinically
                                    significant interaction (i.e., <15% change in theophylline
                                    clearance).
                        The listings of drugs in Tables III and IV are current as
                                    of September 1, 1995. New interactions are continuously being
                                    reported for theophylline, especially with new chemical
                                    entities. 
                              The clinician should not
                                            assume that a drug does not interact with theophylline
                                            if it is not listed in Table III.
                            Before addition of a newly available drug in a
                                    patient receiving theophylline, the package insert of the new
                                    drug and/or the medical literature should be consulted to
                                    determine if an interaction between the new drug and
                                    theophylline has been reported.
