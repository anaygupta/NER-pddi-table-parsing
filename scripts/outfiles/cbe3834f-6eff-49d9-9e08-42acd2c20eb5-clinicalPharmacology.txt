                  Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution possesses predominantly α-adrenergic effects. In the eye, phenylephrine acts locally as a potent vasoconstrictor and mydriatic, by constricting ophthalmic blood vessels and the radial muscle of the iris. The ophthalmologic usefulness of Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is due to its rapid effect and moderately prolonged action, as well as to the fact that it produces no compensatory vasodilation.
                  Although rare, systemic absorption of sufficient quantities of phenylephrine may lead to systemic α-adrenergic effects, such as rise in blood pressure which may be accompanied by a reflex atropine-sensitive bradycardia.
