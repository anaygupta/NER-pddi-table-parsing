                  Thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) released from the hypothalamus stimulates secretion of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone, TSH, from the anterior pituitary. TSH, in turn, is the physiologic stimulus for the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones, L-thyroxine (T
       
 
  4) and L-triiodothyronine (T
       
 
  3), by the thyroid gland. Circulating serum T
       
 
  3 and T
       
 
  4 levels exert a feedback effect on both TRH and TSH secretion. When serum T
       
 
  3 and T
       
 
  4 levels increase, TRH and TSH secretion decrease. When thyroid hormone levels decrease, TRH and TSH secretion increase.
      

 
                  The mechanisms by which thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions are not completely understood, but it is thought that their principal effects are exerted through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. T
       
 
  3 and T
       
 
  4 diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins.
      

 
                  Thyroid hormones regulate multiple metabolic processes and play an essential role in normal growth and development, and normal maturation of the central nervous system and bone. The metabolic actions of thyroid hormones include augmentation of cellular respiration and thermogenesis, as well as metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. The protein anabolic effects of thyroid hormones are essential to normal growth and development.
                  The physiologic actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominately by T
       
 
  3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T
       
 
  4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues.
      

 
                  Levothyroxine, at doses individualized according to patient response, is effective as replacement or supplemental therapy in hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis.
                  Levothyroxine is also effective in the suppression of pituitary TSH secretion in the treatment or prevention of various types of euthyroid goiters, including thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multinodular goiter and, as adjunctive therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer (see

                            - Absorption of orally administered T
         
 
  4 from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract ranges from 40% to 80%. The majority of the levothyroxine dose is absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum. The relative bioavailability of Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP, compared to an equal nominal dose of oral levothyroxine sodium solution, is approximately 99%. T
         
 
  4 absorption is increased by fasting, and decreased in malabsorption syndromes and by certain foods such as soybean infant formula. Dietary fiber decreases bioavailability of T
         
 
  4. Absorption may also decrease with age. In addition, many drugs and foods affect T
         
 
  4 absorption (see

                              Distribution
                            - Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBA), whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higher affinity of both TBG and TBPA for T
         
 
  4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance, and longer half-life of T
         
 
  4 compared to T
         
 
  3. Protein-bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone. Only unbound hormone is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins (see 
         
 
  
                              PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions

                           ). Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier (see

                              Metabolism
                            - T
         
 
  4 is slowly eliminated (see 
         
 
  TABLE 1). The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately eighty-percent of circulating T
         
 
  3 is derived from peripheral T
         
 
  4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T
         
 
  4 and T
         
 
  3; with T
         
 
  4 deiodination also occurring at a number of additional sites, including the kidney and other tissues. Approximately 80% of the daily dose of T
         
 
  4 is deiodinated to yield equal amounts of T
         
 
  3 and reverse T
         
 
  3 (rT
         
 
  3). T
         
 
  3 and rT
         
 
  3 are further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation.
        

 
                        
                           
                              Elimination
                            - Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. Approximately 20% of T
         
 
  4 is eliminated in the stool. Urinary excretion of T
         
 
  4 decreases with age.
