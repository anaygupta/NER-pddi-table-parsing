                  The basic effects of fluphenazine decanoate appear to be no different from those of fluphenazine hydrochloride, with the exception of duration of action.  The esterification of fluphenazine markedly prolongs the drug’s duration of effect without unduly  attenuating its beneficial action.
                  Fluphenazine decanoate has activity at all levels of the central nervous system (CNS) as well as on multiple organ systems.  The mechanism whereby its therapeutic action is exerted is unknown. 
                  Fluphenazine differs from other phenothiazine derivatives in several respects: it is more potent on a milligram basis, it has less potentiating effect on CNS depressants and anesthetics than do some of the phenothiazines and appears to be less sedating, and it is less likely than some of the older phenothiazines to produce hypotension (nevertheless, appropriate cautions should be observed, see
