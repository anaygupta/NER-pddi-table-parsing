                  Other than CYP3A4 drug interactions, FETZIMA is predicted, based on in vitro studies, to have a low potential to be involved in clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.

                     7.3 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)

                     
                        Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of case-control and cohort design have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are co-administered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when FETZIMA is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect FETZIMA

                     
                        Dose adjustment is recommended when FETZIMA is co-administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole) [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. An in vivo study showed a clinically meaningful increase in levomilnacipran exposure when FETZIMA was co-administered with the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (see 
                              Figure 1
                           ).

                        No dose adjustment of FETZIMA is needed when co-administered with a CYP3A4 inducer or substrate.  In vivo studies showed no clinically meaningful change in levomilnacipran exposure when co-administered with the CYP3A4 inducer carbamazepine or the CYP3A4 substrate alprazolam (see 
                              Figure 1
                           ).

                        No dose adjustment of FETZIMA is needed when co-administered with inhibitors of  CYP2C8 , CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2J2, P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. In vitro studies suggested that CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2J2 had minimal contributions to metabolism of levomilnacipran. In addition, levomilnacipran is not a substrate of BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2 and is a weak substrate of P-gp.

                     7.5 Potential for FETZIMA to Affect Other Drugs

                     
                        No dose adjustment of the concomitant medication is recommended when FETZIMA is administered with a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. In vitro studies have shown that levomilnacipran is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. Concomitant use of FETZIMA with alprazolam or carbamazepine, substrates of CYP3A4, had no significant effect on alprazolam or carbamazepine plasma concentrations (see 
                              Figure 1
                           ).

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6 Central Nervous System (CNS)-Active Agents

                     
                        The risk of using FETZIMA in combination with other CNS-active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised when FETZIMA is prescribed in combination with other CNS-active drugs, including those with a similar mechanism of action.

                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Alcohol
                              
                              In an in vitro study, alcohol interacted with the extended-release properties of FETZIMA.  If FETZIMA is taken with alcohol, a pronounced accelerated drug release may occur.  It is recommended that FETZIMA extended-release capsules not be taken with alcohol.
