                           CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors:
                        
                        Concomitant administration of CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors (see 
                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics), such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and amitriptyline (CYP2D6 inhibitors), and ketoconazole and erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitors), may reduce metabolic clearance of tramadol, increasing the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome.
                        
                           Serotonergic Drugs:
                        
                        There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of tramadol and SSRIs/SNRIs or MAOIs and α2-adrenergic blockers. Caution is advised when tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tabletsare coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as SSRIs, MAOIs, triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, or St. John’s Wort. If concomitant treatment of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tabletswith a drug affecting the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see 
                              WARNINGS, Serotonin Syndrome).
                        
                        
                           Triptans
                        
                        Based on the mechanism of action of tramadol and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tabletsare coadministered with a triptan. If concomitant treatment of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tabletswith a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see 
                              WARNINGS, Serotonin Syndrome).
