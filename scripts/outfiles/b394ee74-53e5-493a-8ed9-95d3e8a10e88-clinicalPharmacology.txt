                  Griseofulvin Oral Suspension, USP acts systemically to inhibit the growth of Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton genera of fungi. Fungistatic amounts are deposited in the keratin, which is gradually exfoliated and replaced by noninfected tissue.
                  Griseofulvin absorption from the gastrointestinal tract varies considerably among individuals, mainly because of insolubility of the drug in aqueous media of the upper G.I. tract. The peak serum level found in fasting adults given 0.5 gm occurs at about four hours and ranges between 0.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL.  
                  It should be noted that some individuals are consistently “poor absorbers” and tend to attain lower blood levels at all times. This may explain unsatisfactory therapeutic results in some patients. Better blood levels can probably be attained in most patients if griseofulvin is administered after a meal with a high fat content.
