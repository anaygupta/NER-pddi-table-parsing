                        Phenytoin metabolism may be increased by folic acid. Low serum concentration of phenytoin may result in increased seizure frequency. 
                        Patient’s response to methotrexate therapy may be decreased by folic acid.

                        Pyridoxine requirements may be increased by concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid.

                        In patients with pernicious anemia, the hematologic response to vitamin B12 therapy may be inhibited by concomitant administration of chloramphenicol.
                        
                           
                              Phenytoin 
                           
                        
                        Serum folic acid concentrations may be decreased by phenytoin and, therefore it should be avoided in pregnancy.
