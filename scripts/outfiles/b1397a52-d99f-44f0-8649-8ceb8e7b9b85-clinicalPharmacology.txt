                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Ribavirin is an antiviral agent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties in adults are summarized in Table 12
                           . Ribavirin was rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration. However, due to first-pass metabolism, the absolute bioavailability averaged 64% (44%). There was a linear relationship between dose and AUCtf (AUC from time zero to last measurable concentration) following single doses of 200 to 1200 mg ribavirin. The relationship between dose and Cmax was curvilinear, tending to asymptote above single doses of 400 to 600 mg.
                        Upon multiple oral dosing, based on AUC12 hr, a 6-fold accumulation of ribavirin was observed in plasma. Following oral dosing with 600 mg twice daily, steady-state was reached by approximately 4 weeks, with mean steady-state plasma concentrations of 2200 ng/mL (37%). Upon discontinuation of dosing, the mean half-life was 298 (30%) hours, which probably reflects slow elimination from nonplasma compartments.
                        
                           
                              Effect of Antacid on Absorption of Ribavirin
                           
                        
                        Coadministration of ribavirin with an antacid containing magnesium, aluminum, and simethicone (Mylanta®3) resulted in a 14% decrease in mean ribavirin AUCtf. The clinical relevance of results from this single-dose study is unknown.
                        


                        



                           Tissue Distribution
                        
                        Ribavirin transport into nonplasma compartments has been most extensively studied in red blood cells, and has been identified to be primarily via an es-type equilibrative nucleoside transporter. This type of transporter is present on virtually all cell types and may account for the extensive volume of distribution. Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins. 
                        
                           Metabolism and Excretion
                        
                        Ribavirin has two pathways of metabolism: (i) a reversible phosphorylation pathway in nucleated cells; and (ii) a degradative pathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxylic acid metabolite. Ribavirin and its triazole carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are excreted renally. After oral administration of 600 mg of 14C-ribavirin, approximately 61% and 12% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and feces, respectively, in 336 hours. Unchanged ribavirin accounted for 17% of the administered dose.
                        
                           Special Populations
                        
                        
                           
                              Renal Dysfunction
                           
                        
                        The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin were assessed after administration of a single oral dose (400 mg) of ribavirin to non HCV-infected subjects with varying degrees of renal dysfunction. The mean AUC tf value was threefold greater in subjects with creatinine clearance values between 10 to 30 mL/min when compared to control subjects (creatinine clearance >90 mL/min). In subjects with creatinine clearance values between 30 to 60 mL/min, AUCtf was twofold greater when compared to control subjects. The increased AUCtf appears to be due to reduction of renal and nonrenal clearance in these subjects. Phase III efficacy trials included subjects with creatinine clearance values >50 mL/min. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin cannot be accurately predicted in patients with renal dysfunction. Ribavirin is not effectively removed by hemodialysis. Patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min should not be treated with ribavirin capsules [see Contraindications (4)].
                        
                           
                              Hepatic Dysfunction
                           
                        
                        The effect of hepatic dysfunction was assessed after a single oral dose of ribavirin (600 mg). The mean AUC tf values were not significantly different in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh Classification A, B, or C) when compared to control subjects. However, the mean Cmax values increased with severity of hepatic dysfunction and was twofold greater in subjects with severe hepatic dysfunction when compared to control subjects.

                        Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b in pediatric subjects with chronic hepatitis C between 5 and 16 years of age are summarized in Table 13. The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and pediatric subjects. 
                        


                        


A clinical study in pediatric subjects with chronic hepatitis C between 3 and 17 years of age was conducted in which pharmacokinetics for peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin were evaluated. In pediatric subjects receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing of peginterferon alfa-2b at 60 mcg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted to be 58% [90% CI: 141%, 177%] higher than observed in adults receiving 1.5 mcg/kg/week. The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin (dose-normalized) in this trial were similar to those reported in a prior study of ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b in pediatric subjects and in adult subjects.

                        Both AUCtf and Cmax increased by 70% when ribavirin capsules were administered with a high-fat meal (841 kcal, 53.8 g fat, 31.6 g protein, and 57.4 g carbohydrate) in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

                        The mechanism by which ribavirin contributes to its antiviral efficacy in the clinic is not fully understood. Ribavirin has direct antiviral activity in tissue culture against many RNA viruses. Ribavirin increases the mutation frequency in the genomes of several viruses and ribavirin triphosphate inhibits HCV polymerase in a biochemical reaction. 
                        
                           
                              Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture 
                           
                        
                        The anti-viral activity of ribavirin in the HCV-replicon is not well understood and has not been defined because of the cellular toxicity of ribavirin. Direct anti-viral activity has been observed in tissue culture of other RNA viruses. The anti-HCV activity of interferon was demonstrated in cell containing self-replicating HCV-RNS (HCV replicon cells) or HCV infection.

                        HCV genotypes show wide variability in their response to pegylated recombinant human interferon/ribavirin therapy. Genetic changes associated with the variable response have not been identified.

                        There is no reported cross-resistance between pegylated/non-pegylated interferons and ribavirin.
