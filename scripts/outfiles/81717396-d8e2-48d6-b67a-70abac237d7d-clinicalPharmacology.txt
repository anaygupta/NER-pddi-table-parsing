                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The mechanism of trazodoneâ€™s antidepressant action is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic activity in the CNS.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Preclinical studies have shown that trazodone selectively inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin and acts as an antagonist at 5-HT-2A/2C serotonin receptors.
                        Trazodone is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and, unlike amphetamine-type drugs, does not stimulate the central nervous system.
                        Trazodone antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, a property which may be associated with postural hypotension.

                           Absorption
                        
                        In humans, trazodone hydrochloride is well absorbed after oral administration without selective localization in any tissue. When trazodone hydrochloride is taken shortly after ingestion of food, there may be an increase in the amount of drug absorbed, a decrease in maximum concentration and a lengthening in the time to maximum concentration. Peak plasma levels occur approximately one hour after dosing when trazodone hydrochloride is taken on an empty stomach or 2 hours after dosing when taken with food.
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        
                           In vitro studies in human liver microsomes show that trazodone is metabolized, via oxidative cleavage, to an active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) by CYP3A4. Other metabolic pathways that may be involved in the metabolism of trazodone have not been well characterized. Trazodone is extensively metabolized; less than 1% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.
                        
                           Elimination
                        
                        In some patients trazodone may accumulate in the plasma
                        
                           Protein Binding
                        
                        Trazodone is 89 to 95% protein bound in vitro at concentrations attained with therapeutic doses in humans.
