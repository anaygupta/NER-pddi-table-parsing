                  For the concurrent therapy of either cyclosporine, fibrates, niacin (nicotinic acid), or erythromycin, the risk of myopathy increases [see 
                        Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                      and 
                        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                     ].
                  
 

                  
                  The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of cyclosporine. Limit pravastatin to 20 mg once daily for concomitant use with cyclosporine [see 
                        Dosage and Administration (2.5)
                     , 
                        Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                     , and 
                        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                     ].
                  
 

                  
                  The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of clarithromycin. Limit pravastatin to 40 mg once daily for concomitant use with clarithromycin [see 
                        Dosage and Administration (2.6)
                     , 
                        Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                     , and 
                        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                     ].
                  
 

                  
                  
                  The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of colchicines [see 
                        Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                     ].
                  
 

                  
                  Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of pravastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided [see 
                        Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                     ].
                  
 

                  
                  Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, pravastatin should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates [see 
                        Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                     ].
                  
 

                  
                  The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when pravastatin is used in combination with niacin; a reduction in pravastatin dosage should be considered in this setting [see 
                        Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                     ].
