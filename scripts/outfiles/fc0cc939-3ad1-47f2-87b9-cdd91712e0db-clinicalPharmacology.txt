                        Gastrointestinal absorption of nystatin is insignificant. Most orally administered nystatin is passed unchanged in the stool. In patients with renal insufficiency receiving oral therapy with conventional dosage forms, significant plasma concentrations of nystatin may occasionally occur.

                        Nystatin is both fungistatic and fungicidal against a wide variety of yeasts and yeast like fungi. demonstrates no significant resistance to nystatin on repeated subculture in increasing levels of nystatin; other species become quite resistant. Generally, resistance does not develop . Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of susceptible species with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components. Nystatin exhibits no appreciable activity against bacteria, protozoa, or viruses.
