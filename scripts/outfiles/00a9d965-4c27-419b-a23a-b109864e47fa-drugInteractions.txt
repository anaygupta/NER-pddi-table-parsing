                           Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to      interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.1).
                           A synergistic effect may be expected with      concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular      blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.2).
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.1 Use with Anticholinergics
                     
                        Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.2 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors
                     
                        A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol.
