                     12.1    Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Entecavir is an antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3    Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of entecavir were evaluated in healthy subjects and subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Absorption
                           
                              Following oral administration in healthy subjects, entecavir peak plasma concentrations occurred between 0.5 and 1.5 hours. Following multiple daily doses ranging from 0.1 to 1 mg, Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) at steady state increased in proportion to dose. Steady state was achieved after 6 to 10 days of once-daily administration with approximately 2-fold accumulation. For a 0.5 mg oral dose, Cmax at steady state was 4.2 ng/mL and trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) was 0.3 ng/mL. For a 1 mg oral dose, Cmax was 8.2 ng/mL and Ctrough was 0.5 ng/mL. 
                              In healthy subjects, the bioavailability of the tablet was 100% relative to the oral solution. The oral solution and tablet may be used interchangeably.
                              
                                 Effects of food on oral absorption: Oral administration of 0.5 mg of entecavir with a standard high-fat meal (945 kcal, 54.6 g fat) or a light meal (379 kcal, 8.2 g fat) resulted in a delay in absorption (1.0–1.5 hours fed vs. 0.75 hours fasted), a decrease in Cmax of 44%–46%, and a decrease in AUC of 18%–20% [see Dosage and Administration (2)].
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Distribution
                           
                              Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of entecavir after oral dosing, the estimated apparent volume of distribution is in excess of total body water, suggesting that entecavir is extensively distributed into tissues.
                              Binding of entecavir to human serum proteins in vitro was approximately 13%.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Metabolism and Elimination
                           
                              Following administration of 14C-entecavir in humans and rats, no oxidative or acetylated metabolites were observed. Minor amounts of phase II metabolites (glucuronide and sulfate conjugates) were observed. Entecavir is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system. See Drug Interactions, below.
                              
                              After reaching peak concentration, entecavir plasma concentrations decreased in a bi-exponential manner with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 128–149 hours. The observed drug accumulation index is approximately 2-fold with once-daily dosing, suggesting an effective accumulation half-life of approximately 24 hours.
                              Entecavir is predominantly eliminated by the kidney with urinary recovery of unchanged drug at steady state ranging from 62% to 73% of the administered dose. Renal clearance is independent of dose and ranges from 360 to 471 mL/min suggesting that entecavir undergoes both glomerular filtration and net tubular secretion [see Drug Interactions (7)].
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Special Populations
                           
                              
                                 Gender: There are no significant gender differences in entecavir pharmacokinetics. 
                              
                                 Race: There are no significant racial differences in entecavir pharmacokinetics.
                              
                                 Elderly: The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of entecavir was evaluated following administration of a single 1 mg oral dose in healthy young and elderly volunteers. Entecavir AUC was 29.3% greater in elderly subjects compared to young subjects. The disparity in exposure between elderly and young subjects was most likely attributable to differences in renal function. Dosage adjustment of entecavir should be based on the renal function of the patient, rather than age [see 
                                 
                                    Dosage and Administration (2.4)
                                 
                                 ].
                              
                                 Pediatrics: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of entecavir were evaluated in nucleoside-inhibitor-naïve and lamivudine-experienced HBeAg-positive pediatric subjects 2 to less than 18 years of age with compensated liver disease. Results are shown in Table 6. Entecavir exposure among nucleoside-inhibitor-naïve subjects was similar to the exposure achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of 0.5 mg. Entecavir exposure among lamivudine-experienced subjects was similar to the exposure achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of 1 mg.
                              


                              



                                 Renal impairment: The pharmacokinetics of entecavir following a single 1 mg dose were studied in subjects (without chronic hepatitis B virus infection) with selected degrees of renal impairment, including subjects whose renal impairment was managed by hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Results are shown in Table 7 [see 
                                 
                                    Dosage and Administration (2.4)
                                 
                                 ].
                              


                              


Following a single 1 mg dose of entecavir administered 2 hours before the hemodialysis session, hemodialysis removed approximately 13% of the entecavir dose over 4 hours. CAPD removed approximately 0.3% of the dose over 7 days [see 
                                 
                                    Dosage and Administration (2.4)
                                 
                                 ].
                              
                                 Hepatic impairment: The pharmacokinetics of entecavir following a single 1 mg dose were studied in adult subjects (without chronic hepatitis B virus infection) with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Turcotte-Pugh Class B or C). The pharmacokinetics of entecavir were similar between hepatically impaired and healthy control subjects; therefore, no dosage adjustment of entecavir is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of entecavir have not been studied in pediatric subjects with hepatic impairment.
                              
                                 Post-liver transplant: Limited data are available on the safety and efficacy of entecavir in liver transplant recipients. In a small pilot study of entecavir use in HBV-infected liver transplant recipients on a stable dose of cyclosporine A (n=5) or tacrolimus (n=4), entecavir exposure was approximately 2-fold the exposure in healthy subjects with normal renal function. Altered renal function contributed to the increase in entecavir exposure in these subjects. The potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between entecavir and cyclosporine A or tacrolimus was not formally evaluated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)].
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Drug Interactions
                           
                              The metabolism of entecavir was evaluated in in vitro and in vivo studies. Entecavir is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system. At concentrations up to approximately 10,000-fold higher than those obtained in humans, entecavir inhibited none of the major human CYP450 enzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, 2B6, and 2E1. At concentrations up to approximately 340-fold higher than those observed in humans, entecavir did not induce the human CYP450 enzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, 3A5, and 2B6. The pharmacokinetics of entecavir are unlikely to be affected by coadministration with agents that are either metabolized by, inhibit, or induce the CYP450 system. Likewise, the pharmacokinetics of known CYP substrates are unlikely to be affected by coadministration of entecavir.
                              The steady-state pharmacokinetics of entecavir and coadministered drug were not altered in interaction studies of entecavir with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [see Drug Interactions (7)].

                           Mechanism of Action
                           
                              Entecavir, a guanosine nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV reverse transcriptase (rt), is efficiently phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form, which has an intracellular half-life of 15 hours. By competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate, entecavir triphosphate functionally inhibits all three activities of the HBV reverse transcriptase:  (1) base priming, (2) reverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA, and (3) synthesis of the positive strand of HBV DNA. Entecavir triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerases α, β, and δ and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ with Ki values ranging from 18 to >160 μM.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Antiviral Activity
                           
                              Entecavir inhibited HBV DNA synthesis (50% reduction, EC50) at a concentration of 0.004 μM in human HepG2 cells transfected with wild-type HBV. The median EC50 value for entecavir against lamivudine-resistant HBV (rtL180M, rtM204V) was 0.026 μM (range 0.010–0.059 μM).
                              The coadministration of HIV nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with entecavir is unlikely to reduce the antiviral efficacy of entecavir against HBV or of any of these agents against HIV. In HBV combination assays in cell culture, abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine were not antagonistic to the anti-HBV activity of entecavir over a wide range of concentrations. In HIV antiviral assays, entecavir was not antagonistic to the cell culture anti-HIV activity of these six NRTIs or emtricitabine at concentrations greater than 100 times the Cmax of entecavir using the 1 mg dose.
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Antiviral Activity Against HIV
                                 
                                    A comprehensive analysis of the inhibitory activity of entecavir against a panel of laboratory and clinical HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolates using a variety of cells and assay conditions yielded EC50 values ranging from 0.026 to >10 μM; the lower EC50 values were observed when decreased levels of virus were used in the assay. In cell culture, entecavir selected for an M184I substitution in HIV reverse transcriptase at micromolar concentrations, confirming inhibitory pressure at high entecavir concentrations. HIV variants containing the M184V substitution showed loss of susceptibility to entecavir.

                                    In cell-based assays, 8- to 30-fold reductions in entecavir phenotypic susceptibility were observed for lamivudine-resistant strains. Further reductions (>70-fold) in entecavir phenotypic susceptibility required the presence of amino acid substitutions rtM204I/V with or without rtL180M along with additional substitutions at residues rtT184, rtS202, or rtM250, or a combination of these substitutions with or without an rtI169 substitution in the HBV reverse transcriptase.

                                       Nucleoside-inhibitor-naïve subjects: Genotypic evaluations were performed on evaluable samples (>300 copies/mL serum HBV DNA) from 562 subjects who were treated with entecavir for up to 96 weeks in nucleoside-inhibitor-naïve studies (AI463022, AI463027, and rollover study AI463901). By Week 96, evidence of emerging amino acid substitution rtS202G with rtM204V and rtL180M substitutions was detected in the HBV of 2 subjects (2/562=<1%), and 1 of them experienced virologic rebound (≥1 log10  increase above nadir). In addition, emerging amino acid substitutions at rtM204I/V and rtL180M, rtL80I, or rtV173L, which conferred decreased phenotypic susceptibility to entecavir in the absence of rtT184, rtS202, or rtM250 changes, were detected in the HBV of 3 subjects (3/562=<1%) who experienced virologic rebound. For subjects who continued treatment beyond 48 weeks, 75% (202/269) had HBV DNA <300 copies/mL at end of dosing (up to 96 weeks).
                                    HBeAg-positive (n=243) and -negative (n=39) treatment-naïve subjects who failed to achieve the study-defined complete response by 96 weeks were offered continued entecavir treatment in a rollover study. Complete response for HBeAg-positive was <0.7 MEq/mL (approximately 7 × 105 copies/mL) serum HBV DNA and HBeAg loss and, for HBeAg-negative was <0.7 MEq/mL HBV DNA and ALT normalization. Subjects received 1 mg entecavir once daily for up to an additional 144 weeks. Of these 282 subjects, 141 HBeAg-positive and 8 HBeAg-negative subjects entered the long-term follow-up rollover study and were evaluated for entecavir resistance. Of the 149 subjects entering the rollover study, 88% (131/149), 92% (137/149), and 92% (137/149) attained serum HBV DNA <300 copies/mL by Weeks 144, 192, and 240 (including end of dosing), respectively. No novel entecavir resistance-associated substitutions were identified in a comparison of the genotypes of evaluable isolates with their respective baseline isolates. The cumulative probability of developing rtT184, rtS202, or rtM250 entecavir resistance-associated substitutions (in the presence of rtM204V and rtL180M substitutions) at Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240 was 0.2%, 0.5%, 1.2%, 1.2%, and 1.2%, respectively.
                                    
                                       Lamivudine-refractory subjects:  Genotypic evaluations were performed on evaluable samples from 190 subjects treated with entecavir for up to 96 weeks in studies of lamivudine-refractory HBV (AI463026, AI463014, AI463015, and rollover study AI463901). By Week 96, resistance-associated amino acid substitutions at rtS202, rtT184, or rtM250, with or without rtI169 changes, in the presence of amino acid substitutions rtM204I/V with or without rtL180M, rtL80V, or rtV173L/M emerged in the HBV from 22 subjects (22/190=12%), 16 of whom experienced virologic rebound (≥1 log10 increase above nadir) and 4 of whom were never suppressed <300 copies/mL. The HBV from 4 of these subjects had entecavir resistance substitutions at baseline and acquired further changes on entecavir treatment. In addition to the 22 subjects, 3 subjects experienced virologic rebound with the emergence of rtM204I/V and rtL180M, rtL80V, or rtV173L/M. For isolates from subjects who experienced virologic rebound with the emergence of resistance substitutions (n=19), the median fold-change in entecavir EC50 values from reference was 19-fold at baseline and 106-fold at the time of virologic rebound. For subjects who continued treatment beyond 48 weeks, 40% (31/77) had HBV DNA <300 copies/mL at end of dosing (up to 96 weeks).
                                    Lamivudine-refractory subjects (n=157) who failed to achieve the study-defined complete response by Week 96 were offered continued entecavir treatment. Subjects received 1 mg entecavir once daily for up to an additional 144 weeks. Of these subjects, 80 subjects entered the long-term follow-up study and were evaluated for entecavir resistance. By Weeks 144, 192, and 240 (including end of dosing), 34% (27/80), 35% (28/80), and 36% (29/80), respectively, attained HBV DNA <300 copies/mL. The cumulative probability of developing rtT184, rtS202, or rtM250 entecavir resistance-associated substitutions (in the presence of rtM204I/V with or without rtL180M substitutions) at Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240 was 6.2%, 15%, 36.3%, 46.6%, and 51.5%, respectively. The HBV of 6 subjects developed rtA181C/G/S/T amino acid substitutions while receiving entecavir, and of these, 4 developed entecavir resistance-associated substitutions at rtT184, rtS202, or rtM250 and 1 had an rtT184S substitution at baseline. Of 7 subjects whose HBV had an rtA181 substitution at baseline, 2 also had substitutions at rtT184, rtS202, or rtM250 at baseline and another 2 developed them while on treatment with entecavir.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Cross-resistance
                                 
                                    Cross-resistance has been observed among HBV nucleoside analogue inhibitors. In cell-based assays, entecavir had 8- to 30-fold less inhibition of HBV DNA synthesis for HBV containing lamivudine and telbivudine resistance substitutions rtM204I/V with or without rtL180M than for wild-type HBV. Substitutions rtM204I/V with or without rtL180M, rtL80I/V, or rtV173L, which are associated with lamivudine and telbivudine resistance, also confer decreased phenotypic susceptibility to entecavir. The efficacy of entecavir against HBV harboring adefovir resistance-associated substitutions has not been established in clinical trials. HBV isolates from lamivudine-refractory subjects failing entecavir therapy were susceptible in cell culture to adefovir but remained resistant to lamivudine. Recombinant HBV genomes encoding adefovir resistance-associated substitutions at either rtN236T or rtA181V had 0.3- and 1.1-fold shifts in susceptibility to entecavir in cell culture, respectively.
