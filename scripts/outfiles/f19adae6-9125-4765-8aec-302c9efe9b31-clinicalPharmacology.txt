                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        
                  Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II, GSD II,
                  glycogenosis type II, acid maltase deficiency) is an inherited
                  disorder of glycogen metabolism caused by the absence or marked
                  deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme GAA.
                
                        
                  MYOZYME provides an exogenous source of GAA. 
                  Binding to mannose-6-phosphate receptors on the cell surface has
                  been shown to occur via carbohydrate groups on the GAA molecule,
                  after which it is internalized and transported into lysosomes,
                  where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage that results in
                  increased enzymatic activity. It then exerts enzymatic
                  activity in cleaving glycogen.
                
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        
                  The pharmacokinetics of alglucosidase alfa were evaluated
                  in 13 patients of age ranging from 1 month to 7 months with
                  infantile-onset Pompe disease who received 20 mg/kg (as an
                  approximate 4-hour infusion) or 40 mg/kg (as an approximate
                  6.5-hour infusion) of MYOZYME every 2 weeks. The
                  measurement of alglucosidase alfa plasma concentration was based
                  on an activity assay using an artificial substrate. 
                  Systemic exposure was approximately dose proportional between
                  the 20 and 40 mg/kg doses. Based on the pharmacokinetic blood samples
                  collected for 12 hours after a 4-hr intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg (n=5),
                  the estimated mean AUC was 811 mcg•hr/mL with 17% coefficient of variation
                  [CV], Cmax 162 mcg/mL with 19% CV, clearance 25 mL/hr/kg with 16% CV, 
                  and half-life 2.3 hr with 17% CV.
                        
                  The pharmacokinetics of alglucosidase alfa were also
                  evaluated in a separate trial in 14 patients of age ranging from
                  6 months to 3.5 years with Pompe disease who received 20 mg/kg
                  of MYOZYME as an approximate 4-hour infusion every 2
                  weeks. The pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to
                  those observed for the 20 mg/kg dose group in the trial of
                  patients of age ranging from 1 month to 7 months.
                
                        
                  Nineteen of 21 patients who received treatment with
                  MYOZYME and had pharmacokinetics and antibody titer data
                  available at Week 12 developed antibodies to alglucosidase
                  alfa. Five patients with antibody titers ≥
                  12,800 at Week 12 had an average increase in clearance of
                  50% (range 5% to 90%) from Week 1 to
                  Week 12. The other 14 patients with antibody titers
                  < 12,800 at Week 12 had similar average clearance values
                  at Week 1 and Week 12.
