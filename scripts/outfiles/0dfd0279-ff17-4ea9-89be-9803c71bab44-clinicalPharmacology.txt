                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Ibrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of BTK. Ibrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK is a signaling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. BTK's role in signaling through the B-cell surface receptors results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Nonclinical studies show that ibrutinib inhibits malignant B-cell proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration and substrate adhesion in vitro.

                        In patients with recurrent B-cell lymphoma > 90% occupancy of the BTK active site in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was observed up to 24 hours after ibrutinib doses of ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day (≥ 175 mg/day for average weight of 70 kg).

                                 Absorption 
                              
                              Ibrutinib is absorbed after oral administration with a median Tmax of 1 to 2 hours. Ibrutinib exposure increases with doses up to 840 mg. The steady-state AUC (mean ± standard deviation) observed in patients at 560 mg is 953 ± 705 ng∙h/mL and in patients at 420 mg is 680 ± 517 ng∙h/mL. Administration with food increased ibrutinib Cmax and AUC by approximately 2 to 4- and 2-fold, respectively, compared with administration of ibrutinib after overnight fasting.

                              Reversible binding of ibrutinib to human plasma protein in vitro was 97.3% with no concentration dependence in the range of 50 to 1000 ng/mL. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vd,ss) was 683 L, and the apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vd,ss/F) was approximately 10000 L.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Metabolism
                              
                              Metabolism is the main route of elimination for ibrutinib. It is metabolized to several metabolites primarily by cytochrome P450, CYP3A, and to a minor extent by CYP2D6. The active metabolite, PCI-45227, is a dihydrodiol metabolite with inhibitory activity towards BTK approximately 15 times lower than that of ibrutinib. The range of the mean metabolite to parent ratio for PCI-45227 at steady-state is 1 to 2.8.

                              Intravenous clearance was 62 and 76 L/h in fasted and fed conditions, respectively. In line with the high first-pass effect, the apparent oral clearance is approximately 2000 and 1000 L/h in fasted and fed conditions, respectively. The half-life of ibrutinib is 4 to 6 hours.
                              Ibrutinib, mainly in the form of metabolites, is eliminated primarily via feces. After a single oral administration of radiolabeled [14C]-ibrutinib in healthy subjects, approximately 90% of radioactivity was excreted within 168 hours, with the majority (80%) excreted in the feces and less than 10% accounted for in urine. Unchanged ibrutinib accounted for approximately 1% of the radiolabeled excretion product in feces and none in urine, with the remainder of the dose being metabolites.

                              Ibrutinib is not significantly cleared renally; urinary excretion of metabolites is < 10% of the dose. Creatinine clearance > 25 mL/min had no influence on the exposure to IMBRUVICA. There are no data in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 25 mL/min) or in patients on dialysis.

                              Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver. In a hepatic impairment trial, a single dose of 140 mg of IMBRUVICA was administered in non-cancer subjects. Ibrutinib AUC increased 2.7-, 8.2- and 9.8-fold, respectively, in subjects with mild (n=6), moderate (n=10) and severe (n=8) hepatic impairment relative to subjects with normal liver function.  Ibrutinib Cmax increased 5.2-, 8.8- and 7.0-fold, respectively, in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment relative  to subjects with normal liver function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

                                       Coadministration of Ibrutinib with CYP3A Inhibitors
                                    
                                    In a sequential design trial of 18 healthy, fasted volunteers, a single dose of 120 mg of IMBRUVICA was administered alone on Day 1 and a single dose of 40 mg of IMBRUVICA was administered on Day 7 in combination with 400 mg of ketoconazole (given daily on Days 4 – 9). Ketoconazole increased ibrutinib dose-normalized Cmax and AUC 29-fold and 24-fold, respectively. Simulations using fasted conditions indicate that moderate CYP3A inhibitors diltiazem and erythromycin may increase AUC of ibrutinib by 5- to 8-fold.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Coadministration of Ibrutinib with CYP3A Inducers
                                    
                                    PK data from a dedicated drug interaction trial showed that rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer) decreases ibrutinib Cmax and AUC by more than 13- and 10-fold. Simulations using PBPK suggested that a moderate CYP3A inducer (efavirenz) may decrease the AUC of ibrutinib by up to 3-fold.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Coadministration of Ibrutinib with CYP Substrates
                                    
                                    In vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib (I/Ki < 0.07 using mean Cmax at 560 mg) and PCI-45227 (I/Ki < 0.03) are unlikely to be inhibitors of any major CYPs at clinical doses. Both ibrutinib and the PCI-45227 are weak inducers of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Coadministration of Ibrutinib with Substrates of Transporters
                                    
                                    In vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Systemic ibrutinib is unlikely to be an inhibitor of P-gp at clinical doses ([I]1/Ki < 0.1). However, it may have an effect on P-gp substrates in the GI tract due to higher local concentrations after an oral dose. Co-administration of oral narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin) with IMBRUVICA may increase their blood concentration.
