                        12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                     
                        Taclonex® Topical Suspension combines the pharmacological effects of calcipotriene hydrate as a synthetic vitamin D3 analog and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic corticosteroid. However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in plaque psoriasis are unknown.

                           Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression:
                        
                        HPA axis suppression was evaluated in three trials (Trial A, B and C) following the application of Taclonex® Topical Suspension. In Trial A, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of Taclonex® Topical Suspension on the scalp in combination with Taclonex® Ointment on the body for 4 to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level ≤18 mcg/dL was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in 2 of 11 subjects (18.2%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks.
                        
                           
In Trial B, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=43) with extensive psoriasis involving 15-30% of the body surface area (including the scalp). Treatment consisted of once daily application of Taclonex® Topical Suspension to the body (including the scalp in 36 out of 43 subjects) for 4 to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level ≤18 mcg/dL was observed in 3 out of 43 subjects (7.0%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in none of the 36 subjects who continued treatment for 8 weeks.
                        
                           
In Trial C, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in subjects 12 to 17 years (N=30) with plaque psoriasis of the scalp involving at least 20% of the scalp area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of Taclonex® Topical Suspension to the affected area on the scalp for up to 8 weeks. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level ≤18 mcg/dL was observed in 1 of 30 evaluable subjects (3.3%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in no subjects who continued treatment for 8 weeks.
                        
                        
                        
                           Effects on Calcium Metabolism
                        
                        In Trial A described above, the effects of once daily application of Taclonex® Topical Suspension on the scalp in combination with Taclonex® Ointment on the body for 4 to 8 weeks on calcium metabolism were also examined. Following once daily application of Taclonex® Topical Suspension on the scalp in combination with Taclonex® Ointment on the body, elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in two subjects (one at 4 weeks and one at 8 weeks).
                        
                           
In Trial B, the effects on calcium metabolism of once daily application of Taclonex® Topical Suspension to 15-30% of the body surface area (including the scalp) for 4 to 8 weeks were also examined. There was no change in mean serum or urinary calcium levels. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in two subjects (one at 4 weeks and one at 8 weeks).
                        
                        In addition, calcium metabolism was evaluated in a total of 109 subjects aged 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis of the scalp involving at least 10% of the scalp area undergoing once daily application of Taclonex® Topical Suspension to the scalp for up to 8 weeks. No cases of hypercalcemia and no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported.

                           Taclonex® Topical Suspension:
                        
                        The systemic effect of Taclonex® Topical Suspension in psoriasis was investigated in Trials A and B described above. In Trial A, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 and 8 weeks of once daily application of Taclonex® Topical Suspension on the scalp in combination with Taclonex® Ointment on the body. Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated.
                        
                        However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29.4%) subjects at week 4 and in 5 of 12 (41.7%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (55.9%) subjects at week 4 and 7 of 12 (58.3%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.
                        
                        In Trial B, the plasma levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks of once daily application of Taclonex® Topical Suspension to 15-30% of the body surface area (scalp and non-scalp areas). Calcipotriene and its metabolite MC1080 were below the lower limit of quantification in all plasma samples. Betamethasone dipropionate was quantifiable in 1 sample each taken from 4 of 43 (9.3%) subjects. The metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate (B17P) was quantifiable in 16 of 43 (37.2%) subjects. The plasma concentrations of betamethasone dipropionate ranged from 30.9-63.5 pg/mL and that of its metabolite betamethasone 17-propionate ranged from 30.5-257 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.
                        
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        
                           Calcipotriene:
                        
                        Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound.
                        
                        Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the α,ß-unsaturated ketone analog of calcipotriene),which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analog). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid.
                        
                        
                           Betamethasone dipropionate:
                        
                        Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6ß-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite.
