    Studies indicate allergic individuals produce immunoglobulins of the IgE class in response to exposure to grass pollens. Subsequent exposure to grass pollen results in a combination of allergen with IgE antibody fixed on mast cells or basophil membranes. This cross-linking results in stimulation of mast cell which leads to release and generation of pharmacologically active substances that produce immediate hypersensitivity reaction.15
                     
    The mode of action of immunotherapy with allergenic extracts is still being investigated. Subcutaneous injections of increasing doses of allergenic extract into patients with allergic disease have been shown to result in both humoral and cellular changes. These include production of allergen specific IgG antibodies, suppression of histamine release from target cells, decrease in circulating levels of antigen specific IgE antibody over long periods of time and suppression of peripheral blood T-Iymphocyte cell responses to antigen. 5,9,10
                     
    Puncture and intradermal data from skin testing with CBER grass reference is summarized in Table 1. Fifteen patients with clinical symptoms when exposed to grass pollen were included in the study. The mean sum erythema (PSumE) and mean sum wheal (PSumW) from puncture testing is listed in Table 1A. The Intradermal Dilution for 50 mm Sum of Erythema determines Bioequivalent ALlergy Units (ID50EAL) method was used by CBER personnel to calculate intradermal dose (BAU/ml). The calculated mean and ranges of intradermal dose (BAU/ml) for 50 mm sum of erythema using reference extract is summarized in Table 1B. 17

    Relative potency value of various lots of non-standardized grass pollen extracts are summarized in Table 2. The acceptable BAU/ml ranges for equivalency to FDA reference for a 100,000 BAU/ml product are 69,900-143,100 at n=3, 73,300-136,400 at n=4 and 75,800-132,000 at n=5. Acceptable equivalency ranges for a 10,000 BAU/ml product are 6,990-14,310 at n=3, 7,330-13,640 at n=4 and 7,580-13,200 at n=5 (n=number of tests performed).
