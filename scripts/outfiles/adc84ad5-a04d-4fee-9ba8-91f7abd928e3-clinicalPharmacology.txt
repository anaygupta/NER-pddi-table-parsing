                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Bosutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Bosutinib inhibits the Bcr-Abl kinase that promotes CML; it is also an inhibitor of Src-family kinases including Src, Lyn, and Hck. Bosutinib inhibited 16 of 18 imatinib-resistant forms of Bcr-Abl expressed in murine myeloid cell lines. Bosutinib did not inhibit the T315I and V299L mutant cells. In mice, treatment with bosutinib reduced the size of CML tumors relative to controls and inhibited growth of murine myeloid tumors expressing several imatinib-resistant forms of Bcr-Abl. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        The effect of a single dose of bosutinib 500 mg alone and with ketoconazole on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) two or three-period crossover thorough QT study in 60 healthy subjects. No significant changes in placebo adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc were observed.

                                 Absorption
                              
                              Following administration of a single dose of BOSULIF 500 mg with food in patients with cancer, the median time-to-peak concentration (tmax) was 4–6 hours. Bosutinib exhibits dose proportional increases in AUC and Cmax, over the dose range of 200 to 800 mg. After 15 daily doses of BOSULIF (500 mg) with food in patients with CML, the mean (SD) Cmax value was 200 (12) ng/mL, and the mean (SD) AUC was 3650 (425) ng∙h/mL. When given with a high fat meal, the Cmax and AUC of bosutinib increased 1.8- and 1.7-fold, respectively.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Distribution
                              
                              After administration of a single dose of BOSULIF 500 mg with food in patients with CML, bosutinib had a mean apparent volume of distribution ± standard deviation of 6080 ± 1230 L.
                              Bosutinib was highly bound to human plasma proteins in vitro (94%) and ex vivo in healthy subjects (96%), and binding was not concentration-dependent. Bosutinib is a P-gp substrate and inhibitor in vitro. No studies have been conducted with other transporters.

                              Bosutinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. The major circulating metabolites identified in plasma are oxydechlorinated (M2) bosutinib (19% of parent exposure) and N-desmethylated (M5) bosutinib (25% of parent exposure), with bosutinib N-oxide (M6) as a minor circulating metabolite. All the metabolites were deemed inactive.

                              In patients with CML given single oral doses of BOSULIF 500 mg with food, the mean terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2) was 22.5 (1.7) hours, and the mean (SD) clearance (Cl/F) was 189 (48) L/h. In six healthy male subjects given a single oral dose of [14C] radiolabeled bosutinib, 91.3% of the dose was recovered in feces and 3% of the dose recovered in urine.

                              In a dedicated hepatic impairment trial, a single dose of BOSULIF 200 mg was administered with food to 18 volunteers with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C) and 9 matched healthy volunteers. Cmax of bosutinib increased 2.4-fold, 2-fold, and 1.5-fold, respectively, in Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C, and bosutinib AUC increased 2.3-fold, 2-fold, and 1.9-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

                              In a dedicated renal impairment trial, a single dose of BOSULIF 200 mg was administered with food to 26 subjects with mild (CLcr: 51 to 80 mL/min), moderate (CLcr: 30 to 50 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 mL/min) and to 8 subjects with normal renal function. Creatinine Clearance for category classification was calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment had a 35% and 60% increase in AUC compared to subjects with normal renal function, respectively. Bosutinib exposure was not changed in subjects with mild renal impairment. The BOSULIF dose should be reduced in patients with severe (CLcr less than 30 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr between 30 to 50 mL/min) renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

                                    In a cross-over trial of 24 healthy volunteers, a single dose of 100 mg of BOSULIF was either administered alone or in combination with five daily doses of 400 mg of ketoconazole under fasting conditions. Ketoconazole increased bosutinib Cmax and AUC 5.2-fold and 8.6-fold, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

                                    In a cross-over trial of 24 healthy volunteers, a single dose of 500 mg of BOSULIF was either administered alone or in combination with six daily doses of 600 mg of rifampin under fed conditions. Rifampin decreased bosutinib Cmax and AUC by 86% and 94%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

                                    An in vitro study suggests that BOSULIF has the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of drugs that are P-gp substrates. The estimated I/IC50 was 0.19, when considering the Cmax at the 500 mg dose of BOSULIF.

                                    BOSULIF displays pH-dependent aqueous solubility, in vitro. In a cross-over trial in 24 healthy volunteers, a single oral dose of 400 mg of BOSULIF was either administered alone or in combination with multiple-oral doses of 60 mg of lansoprazole under fasting conditions. Lansoprazole decreased bosutinib Cmax and AUC by 46% and 26%, respectively.
