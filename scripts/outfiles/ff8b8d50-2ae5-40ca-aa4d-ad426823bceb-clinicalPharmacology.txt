                  Mechanism of Action:

                  Fexofenadine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist activity. Both enantiomers of fexofenadine hydrochloride displayed approximately equipotent antihistaminic effects. Fexofenadine inhibited histamine release from peritoneal mast cells in rats. In laboratory animals, no anticholinergic, alpha1-adrenergic or beta-adrenergic-receptor blocking effects were observed. No sedative or other central nervous system effects were observed. Radiolabeled tissue distribution studies in rats indicated that fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier.
