                  Natural substances that have vitamin B6 activity are                            pyridoxine in plants and pyridoxal or pyridoxamine in animals.  All                            3 are converted to pyridoxal phosphate by the enzyme pyridoxal                            kinase.  The physiologically active forms of vitamin B6                            are pyridoxal phosphate (codecarboxylase) and pyridoxamine                            phosphate.  Riboflavin is required for the conversion of pyridoxine                            phosphate to pyridoxal phosphate.
                  Vitamin B6 acts as a coenzyme in the metabolism of                            protein, carbohydrate, and fat.  In protein metabolism, it                            participates in the decarboxylation of amino acids, conversion of                            tryptophan to niacin or to serotonin (5-hydroxtryptamine), deamination,                            and transamination and transulfuration of amino acids.  In                            carbohydrate metabolism, it is responsible for the breakdown of glycogen                            to glucose-1-phosphate.
                  The total adult body pool consists of 16 to 25 mg of                            pyridoxine.  Its half-life appears to be 15 to 20 days.                             Vitamin B6 is degraded to 4-pyridoxic acid in the                            liver.  This metabolite is excreted in the urine.
                  The need for pyridoxine increases with the amount of protein in                            the diet.  The tryptophan load test appears to uncover early                            vitamin B6 deficiency by detecting xanthinurea.  The                            average adult minimum daily requirement is about 1.25 mg.  The                            ‘‘Recommended Dietary Allowance’’ of the                            National Academy of Sciences is estimated to be as much as 2.2 mg for                            adults and 2.5 mg for pregnant and lactating women.  The                            requirements are more in persons having certain genetic defects or those                            being treated with isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INHJ) or oral                            contraceptives.
