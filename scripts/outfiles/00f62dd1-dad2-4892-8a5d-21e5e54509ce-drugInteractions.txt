                           Beta-adrenergic blocking agents
                           
                              Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and BetimolÂ® should be observed for a potential additive effect either on the intraocular pressure or on the known systemic effects of beta-blockade.
                              Patients should not usually receive two topical ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents concurrently.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Catecholamine-depleting drugs
                           
                              Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Calcium antagonists
                           
                              Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists, because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Digitalis and calcium antagonists
                           
                              The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time.
