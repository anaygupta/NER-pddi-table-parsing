                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown.

                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Systemic exposure of adapalene following a topical application of DIFFERIN Lotion was studied in one clinical study. Fourteen subjects at 18-29 years of age with severe acne were treated with 2 g of DIFFERIN Lotion once daily for 30 days to approximately 1000 cm2 of acne involved skin. Serial plasma samples were collected for 24 or 72 hours following application on days 1, 15 and 30. All plasma concentrations for 12 out of 14 patients were below the limit of quantification (LOQ=0.1 ng/mL). One patient had one sample above LOQ at day 30 and the other patient had four plasma samples above LOQ on both days 1 and 15, which ranged from 0.102 and 0.131 ng/mL. Due to the limited number of available data points, PK analysis was not undertaken.
