                  The ioflupane within DaTscan binds to the dopamine transporter. Drugs that bind to the dopamine transporter with high affinity may interfere with the image obtained following DaTscan administration. These potentially interfering drugs consist of: amoxapine, amphetamine, benztropine, bupropion, buspirone, cocaine, mazindol, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, norephedrine, phentermine, phenylpropanolamine, selegiline, and sertraline. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (paroxetine and citalopram) may increase or decrease ioflupane binding to the dopamine transporter. Whether discontinuation of these drugs prior to DaTscan administration may minimize the interference with a DaTscan image is unknown. 
                  The impact of dopamine agonists and antagonists upon DaTscan imaging results has not been established.
