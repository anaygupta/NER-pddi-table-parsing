                  The mechanism for the pharmacologic action of allergenic extracts used diagnostically is based on the liberation of histamine and other substances when the allergen reacts with IgE antibody attached to mast cells. The mechanism of the therapeutic effect is not well understood and further research is required to substantiate current hypotheses.

	Mites belonging to the genus Dermatophagoides are found in approximately 80% of house dust samples throughout the world2,3. D. farinae is common in much of the United States3, although D. pteronyssinus is predominant in certain coastal regions and both species are commonly found in homes 4,5.

	The diagnosis of mite allergy is established by the allergy history and skin test reactivity 6,7.

	Immunotherapy with mite extract has been studied by several investigators. It is generally believed that hyposensitization with this product is helpful in reducing symptoms associated with house dust allergy 8,9.
