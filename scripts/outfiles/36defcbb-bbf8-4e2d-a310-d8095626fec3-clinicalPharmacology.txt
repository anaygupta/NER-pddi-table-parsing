                         12.1  Mechanism of Action 

                     
                     
                        Morphine sulfate, an opioid agonist, is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can interact with other opioid receptors at higher doses. In addition to analgesia, the widely diverse effects of morphine sulfate include analgesia, dysphoria, euphoria, somnolence, respiratory depression, diminished gastrointestinal motility, altered circulatory dynamics, histamine release, physical dependence, and alterations of the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems.
                        Morphine produces both its therapeutic and its adverse effects by interaction with one or more classes of specific opioid receptors located throughout the body. Morphine acts as a full agonist, binding with and activating opioid receptors at sites in the peri-aqueductal and peri-ventricular grey matter, the ventro-medial medulla and the spinal cord to produce analgesia.
                        
                           Effects on the Central Nervous System 
                        
                        The principal actions of therapeutic value of morphine are analgesia and sedation. Specific CNS opiate receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are likely to play a role in the expression of analgesic effects.
                        Morphine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brainstem respiratory centers.  The mechanism of respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brainstem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension, and to electrical stimulation.
                        Morphine depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla.  Morphine causes miosis, even in total darkness.  Pinpoint pupils are a sign of narcotic overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings).  Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with worsening hypoxia.
                        
                           Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle
                        
                        Morphine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and in the duodenum.  Digestion of food is delayed in the small intestine and propulsive contractions are decreased.  Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm.  The end result is constipation.  Morphine can cause a marked reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.
                        
                           Effects on the Cardiovascular System 
                        
                        Morphine produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension.  Release of histamine can occur and may contribute to opioid-induced hypotension.  Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating.
                        
                           Effects on the Endocrine System
                        
                        Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans.  They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.
                        
                           Effects on the Immune System 
                        
                        Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models.  The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.  Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.

                           Plasma Level-Analgesia Relationships
                        
                        While plasma morphine-efficacy relationships can be demonstrated in non-tolerant individuals, they are influenced by a wide variety of factors and are not generally useful as a guide to the clinical use of morphine.  Dosages of morphine should be chosen and must be titrated on the basis of clinical evaluation of the patient and the balance between therapeutic and adverse effects.
                        
                           CNS Depressant/Alcohol Interaction
                        
                        Additive pharmacodynamic effects may be expected when morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                         12.3  Pharmacokinetics 

                     
                     
                        Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are a controlled-release tablet containing morphine sulfate. Morphine is released from morphine sulfate extended-release tablets somewhat more slowly than from immediate-release oral preparations.  Following oral administration of a given dose of morphine, the amount ultimately absorbed is essentially the same whether the source is morphine sulfate extended-release tablets or an immediate-release formulation.  Because of pre-systemic elimination (i.e., metabolism in the gut wall and liver) only about 40% of the administered dose reaches the central compartment.
                        
                           Absorption
                        
                        The oral bioavailability of morphine is approximately 20 to 40%.  When morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are given on a fixed dosing regimen, steady-state is achieved in about a day.
                        
                           Food Effect 
                        
                        The effect of food upon the systemic bioavailability of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets has not been systematically evaluated for all strengths.  One study, conducted with the 30 mg morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, showed no significant differences in Cmax and AUC (0-24h) values, whether the tablet was taken while fasting or with a high-fat breakfast.
                        
                           Distribution
                        
                        Once absorbed, morphine is distributed to skeletal muscle, kidneys, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain.  Morphine also crosses placental membranes and has been found in breast milk. The volume of distribution (Vd) for morphine is approximately 3 to 4 liters per kilogram and morphine is 30 to 35% reversibly bound to plasma proteins.
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        The major pathways of morphine metabolism include glucuronidation to produce metabolites including morphine-3-glucuronide, M3G (about 50%) and morphine-6-glucuronide, M6G (about 5 to 15%) and sulfation in the liver to produce morphine-3-etheral sulfate. A small fraction (less than 5%) of morphine is demethylated.   M6G has been shown to have analgesic activity but crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, while M3G has no significant analgesic activity.
                        
                           Excretion
                        
                        The elimination of morphine occurs primarily as renal excretion of M3G and its effective half-life after intravenous administration is normally 2 to 4 hours.  Approximately 10% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. In some studies involving longer periods of plasma sampling, a longer terminal half-life of about 15 hours was reported.  A small amount of the glucuronide conjugate is excreted in the bile, and there is some minor enterohepatic recycling.
                        
                           Special Populations
                        
                        
                           Geriatric Patients
                        
                        The pharmacokinetics of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets have not been studied in elderly patients.
                        
                           Pediatric Patients
                        
                        The pharmacokinetics of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets has not been studied in pediatric patients below the age of 18.
                        
                           Gender
                        
                        A gender analysis of pharmacokinetic data from healthy subjects taking morphine sulfate extended-release tablets indicated that morphine concentrations were similar in males and females.
                        
                           Race
                        
                        Chinese subjects given intravenous morphine had a higher clearance when compared to Caucasian subjects (1852 +/- 116 mL/min compared to 1495 +/- 80 mL/min).
                        
                           Hepatic Impairment
                        
                        Morphine pharmacokinetics are altered in individuals with cirrhosis. Clearance was found to decrease with a corresponding increase in half-life. The M3G and M6G to morphine plasma AUC ratios also decreased in these subjects, indicating diminished metabolic activity.  Adequate studies of the pharmacokinetics of morphine in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been conducted.
                        
                           Renal Impairment
                        
                        Morphine pharmacokinetics are altered in patients with renal failure. The AUC is increased and clearance is decreased and the metabolites, M3G and M6G, may accumulate to much higher plasma levels in patients with renal failure as compared to patients with normal renal function. Adequate studies of the pharmacokinetics of morphine in patients with severe renal impairment have not been conducted.
