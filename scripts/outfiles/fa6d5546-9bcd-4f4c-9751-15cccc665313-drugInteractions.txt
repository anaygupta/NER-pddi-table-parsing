                  The risks of using olanzapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies.

                     7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Olanzapine
                     
                        — The coadministration of diazepam with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine .   — Single doses of cimetidine (800 mg) or aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids did not affect the oral bioavailability of olanzapine.   — Carbamazepine therapy (200 mg bid) causes an approximately 50% increase in the clearance of olanzapine. This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 activity. Higher daily doses of carbamazepine may cause an even greater increase in olanzapine clearance.   — Ethanol (45 mg/70 kg single dose) did not have an effect on olanzapine pharmacokinetics. The coadministration of alcohol (i.e., ethanol) with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine .     Fluvoxamine, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, decreases the clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean increase in olanzapine C following fluvoxamine of 54% in female nonsmokers and 77% in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC is 52% and 108%, respectively. Lower doses of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving concomitant treatment with fluvoxamine.     Fluoxetine (60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily dose for 8 days) causes a small (mean 16%) increase in the maximum concentration of olanzapine and a small (mean 16%) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of the impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals, and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended. When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax*.   — Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics .   — Omeprazole and rifampin may cause an increase in olanzapine clearance.   — The administration of activated charcoal (1 g) reduced the C and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60%. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine overdose.

                     7.2 Potential for Olanzapine to Affect Other Drugs
                     
                        — Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when olanzapine is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol.   — Olanzapine, because of its potential for inducing hypotension, may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.   — Olanzapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.   — Multiple doses of olanzapine (10 mg for 8 days) did not influence the kinetics of lithium. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of lithium .   — Olanzapine (10 mg daily for 2 weeks) did not affect the steady state plasma concentrations of valproate. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of valproate .   — studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes.   — Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of imipramine or its active metabolite desipramine.   — Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin .   — Olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam or its active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam. However, diazepam coadministered with olanzapine increased the orthostatic hypotension observed with either drug given alone .   — Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of ethanol .   — Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of biperiden.   — Multiple doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline or its metabolites.
