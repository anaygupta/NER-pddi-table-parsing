                     7.1 Anticholinergics
                     
                        There is potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medicines. Therefore, avoid coadministration of INCRUSE ELLIPTA with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5), Adverse Reactions (6)].
