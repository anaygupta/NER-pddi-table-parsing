                  ProcalAmine® provides a physiological ratio of biologically utilizable essential and nonessential amino acids, a nonprotein energy source, and a balanced pattern of maintenance electrolytes.
                  The amino acids provide substrates for protein synthesis as well as sparing body protein and muscle mass. Glycerin USP (glycerol), a utilizable energy substrate, is also provided which serves to preserve body protein. Glycerol participates as an active energy substrate through its phosphorylation to α-glycerophosphate and subsequent conversion to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, one of the two key trioses in the metabolism of glucose for energy generation.
                  The metabolism of glycerol has been investigated in both animals and humans. The liver is chiefly responsible for the high potential of glycerol utilization for gluconeogenesis, accounting for at least three-fourths of the total capacity of the body to utilize glycerol. Further, the kidney accounts for up to one-fifth of this total capacity. Among other kinds of cells and tissues shown to utilize glycerol at various rates are the brain, intestine, muscle, leukocytes, lungs and spermatozoa.
                  In a multicenter clinical study, mildly catabolic post-surgical patients receiving ProcalAmine® (3% Amino Acid and 3% Glycerin Injection with Electrolytes) showed a significant improvement in nitrogen balance when compared with patients receiving isonitrogenous amino acids.
