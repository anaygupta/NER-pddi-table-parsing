                           CNS depressants: Increased  risk of respiratory depression (7.1)

                           Muscle relaxants: May enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce respiratory depression (7.2)

                           Mixed agonist/antagonist opioid analgesics: May reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms (7.3)

                           Cimetidine: May increase respiratory and CNS depression (7.4)

                           Anticholinergics: May increase the risk of urinary retention, severe constipation, or paralytic ileus (7.6)

                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants

                     
                        Central nervous system depressants including other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, antiemetics or alcohol increase the risks of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation and coma if given concomitantly with morphine sulfate injection.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Muscle Relaxants

                     
                        Morphine sulfate may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics

                     
                        Do not administer mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine and butorphanol) to patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as Morphine Sulfate Injection USP. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Cimetidine

                     
                        Concomitant administration of morphine sulfate and cimetidine has been reported to precipitate apnea, confusion and muscle twitching in an isolated report.  Monitor patients for increased respiratory and CNS depression when receiving cimetidine concomitantly with Morphine Sulfate Injection USP.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

                     
                        MAOIs markedly potentiate the action of Morphine Sulfate Injection USP. Allow at least 14 days after stopping treatment with MAOIs before initiating treatment with Morphine Sulfate Injection USP.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6 Anticholinergics

                     
                        Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention, severe constipation or paralytic ileus.
