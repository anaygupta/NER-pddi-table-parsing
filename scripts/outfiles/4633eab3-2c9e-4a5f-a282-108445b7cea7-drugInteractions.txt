                  Other AntihypertensivesIndapamide may add to or potentiate the action of other 
antihypertensive drugs. In limited controlled trials that compared the effect of 
indapamide combined with other antihypertensive drugs with the effect of the 
other drugs administered alone, there was no notable change in the nature or 
frequency of adverse reactions associated with the combined therapy.

                  Post-Sympathectomy PatientThe antihypertensive effect of the drug may be enhanced in the 
post-sympathectomized patient.
                  
                  
                  NorepinephrineIndapamide, like the thiazides, may decrease arterial 
responsiveness to norepinephrine, but this diminution is not sufficient to 
preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.
                  
                  
                  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
FertilityBoth mouse and rat lifetime carcinogenicity studies were 
conducted. There was no significant difference in the incidence of tumors 
between the indapamide-treated animals and the control groups.
