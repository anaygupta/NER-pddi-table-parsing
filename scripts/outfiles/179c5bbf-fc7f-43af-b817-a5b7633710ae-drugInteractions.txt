                           Aminoglutethimide
                           
                              Aminoglutethimide may lead to a loss of corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents
                           
                              When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents (i.e., amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Antibiotics
                           
                              Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Anticholinesterases
                           
                              Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Anticoagulants, oral
                           
                              Coadministration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect. 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Antidiabetics
                           
                              Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Antitubercular drugs
                           
                              Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Cholestyramine
                           
                              Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Cyclosporine
                           
                              Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Digitalis glycosides
                           
                              Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Estrogens, including oral contraceptives
                           
                              Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Hepatic Enzyme Inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin)
                           
                              Drugs which induce hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme activity may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Ketoconazole
                           
                              Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)
                           
                              Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Skin tests
                           
                              Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Vaccines
                           
                              Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines. Routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible (see
