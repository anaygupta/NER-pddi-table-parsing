                  OSPHENA is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. CYP2C19 and other pathways contribute to the metabolism of ospemifene.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Do not use estrogens or estrogen agonist/antagonist concomitantly with OSPHENA (7.1,12.3)
                           Do not use fluconazole concomitantly with OSPHENA. Fluconazole increases serum concentrations of OSPHENA (7.2, 12.3) 
                           Do not use rifampin concomitantly with OSPHENA. Rifampin decreases serum concentration of OSPHENA (7.2, 12.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Estrogens and estrogen agonist/antagonist
                     
                        OSPHENA should not be used concomitantly with estrogens and estrogen agonists/antagonists. The safety of concomitant use of OSPHENA with estrogens and estrogen agonists/antagonists has not been studied.  
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Fluconazole  
                     
                        Fluconazole, a moderate CYP3A / strong CYP2C9 / moderate CYP2C19 inhibitor, should not be used with OSPHENA.  Fluconazole increases the systemic exposure of ospemifene by 2.7-fold. Administration of fluconazole with ospemifene may increase the risk of OSPHENA-related adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Rifampin  
                     
                        Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 / moderate CYP2C9 / moderate CYP2C19 inducer, decreases the systemic exposure of ospemifene by 58%. Therefore, co-administration of OSPHENA with drugs such as rifampin which induce CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and/or CYP2C19 activity would be expected to decrease the systemic exposure of ospemifene, which may decrease the clinical effect [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Ketoconazole	
                     
                        Ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases the systemic exposure of ospemifene by 1.4-fold. Administration of ketoconazole chronically with ospemifene may increase the risk of OSPHENA-related adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Warfarin
                     
                        Repeated administration of ospemifene had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. No study was conducted with multiple doses of warfarin. The effect of ospemifene on clotting time such as the International Normalized Ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) was not studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6 Highly Protein-Bound Drugs
                     
                        Ospemifene is more than 99% bound to serum proteins and might affect the protein binding of other drugs. Use of OSPHENA with other drug products that are highly protein bound may lead to increased exposure of either that drug or ospemifene [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.7 Multiple Enzyme Inhibition
                     
                        Co-administration of OSPHENA with a drug known to inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes may increase the risk of OSPHENA-related adverse reactions.
