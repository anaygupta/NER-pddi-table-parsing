                  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYEach nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals capsule contains 
two forms of nitrofurantoin. Twenty-five percent is macrocrystalline 
nitrofurantoin, which has slower dissolution and absorption than nitrofurantoin 
monohydrate. The remaining 75 percent is nitrofurantoin monohydrate contained in a 
powder blend which, upon exposure to gastric and intestinal fluids, forms a gel 
matrix that releases nitrofurantoin over time. Based on urinary pharmacokinetic 
data, the extent and rate of urinary excretion of nitrofurantoin from the 100 mg 
nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals capsule are similar to those of the 50 
mg or 100 mg nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsule. Approximately 20 to 25 percent of a 
single dose of nitrofurantoin is recovered from the urine unchanged over 24 
hours.
                  Plasma nitrofurantoin concentrations after a single oral dose of the 100 mg 
nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals capsule are low, with peak levels 
usually less than 1 mcg/mL. Nitrofurantoin is highly soluble in urine, to which 
it may impart a brown color. When nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals is 
administered with food, the bioavailability of nitrofurantoin is increased by 
approximately 40 percent.
