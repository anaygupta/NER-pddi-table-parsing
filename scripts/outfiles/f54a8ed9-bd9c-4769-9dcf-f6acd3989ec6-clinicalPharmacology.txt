                  Parenteral administration of PONTOCAINE stabilizes the neuronal membrane and prevents initiation and transmission of nerve impulses thereby effecting local anesthesia.
                  The onset of action is rapid, and the duration prolonged (up to two or three hours or longer of surgical anesthesia).
                  PONTOCAINE is detoxified by plasma esterases to aminobenzoic acid and diethylaminoethanol.
