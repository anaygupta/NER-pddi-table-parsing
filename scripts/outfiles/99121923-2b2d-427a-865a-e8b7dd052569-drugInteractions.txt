                        Pyridoxine supplements should not be given to patients receiving the drug levodopa, because the action of levodopa is antagonized by pyridoxine. However, pyridoxine may be used concurrently in patients recieving a a preparation containing both carbidopa and levodopa. Concurrent use of phenytoin and folacin (folic acid) may result in decreased phenytoin effectiveness.
