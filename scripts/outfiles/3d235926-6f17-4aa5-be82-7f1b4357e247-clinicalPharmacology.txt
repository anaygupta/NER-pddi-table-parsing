                     Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate 
                     
                        Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream has been shown to be at least as effective as clotrimazole alone in a different cream vehicle. Use of corticosteroids in the treatment of fungal infection may lead to suppression of host inflammation leading to worsening or decreased cure rate.

                        Skin penetration and systemic absorption of clotrimazole following topical application of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream have not been studied. The following information was obtained using 1% clotrimazole cream and solution formulations. Six hours after the application of radioactive clotrimazole 1% cream and 1% solution onto intact and acutely inflamed skin, the concentration of clotrimazole varied from 100 mcg/cm3 in the stratum corneum, to 0.5 to 1 mcg/cm3 in the reticular dermis, and 0.1 mcg/cm3 in the subcutis. No measurable amount of radioactivity (<0.001 mcg/mL) was found in the serum within 48 hours after application under occlusive dressing of 0.5 mL of the solution or 0.8 g of the cream. Only 0.5% or less of the applied radioactivity was excreted in the urine.

                        Mechanism of Action: Clotrimazole is an imidazole antifungal agent. Imidazoles inhibit 14-(-demethylation of lanosterol in fungi by binding to one of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes. This leads to the accumulation of 14-(-methylsterols and reduced concentrations of ergosterol, a sterol essential for a normal fungal cytoplasmic membrane. The methylsterols may affect the electron transport system, thereby inhibiting growth of fungi.
                        Activity In Vivo: Clotrimazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following dermatophytes, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE  section: Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum.
                        Activity In Vitro: In vitro, clotrimazole has been shown to have activity against many dermatophytes, 
                              but the clinical significance of this information is unknown.
                        
                        Drug Resistance: Strains of dermatophytes having a natural resistance to clotrimazole have not been reported. Resistance to azoles including clotrimazole has been reported in some Candida species.
                        No single-step or multiple-step resistance to clotrimazole has developed during successive passages of Trichophyton mentagrophytes.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Betamethasone Dipropionate 
                     
                        Betamethasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, has been shown to have topical (dermatologic) and systemic pharmacologic and metabolic effects characteristic of this class of drugs.
                        
                           Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier and the use of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  section).  Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  section).
                        Once absorbed through the skin, the pharmacokinetics of topical corticosteroids are similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.
                        Studies performed with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream indicate that this topical combination antifungal/corticosteroid may have vasoconstrictor potencies in a range that is comparable to high potency topical corticosteroids. Therefore, use is not recommended in patients less than 17 years of age, in diaper dermatitis, and under occlusion.
