                        Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].

                        The pharmacodynamics of Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) Oral Granules is unknown. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics in children 4 to 8 years of age with tinea capitis was investigated in a pharmacokinetic study after single and repeated (for 42 days) oral administration of Lamisil Oral Granules (N=16), once daily, using the body weight groups and doses described in Section 2. The systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24) of terbinafine in children had a relatively high interindividual variability (ranging from 36% to 64%). At steady state the AUC0-24 increased by a mean factor of 1.9 to 2.1 across doses. The mean (SD) effective half-life obtained from the observed accumulation was 26.7 (13.8) hours and 30.5 (9.3) hours for the 125 mg and 187.5 mg doses, respectively.  
                        Systemic exposure to terbinafine in the children did not exceed the highest values of the systemic exposure in adults receiving repeated once daily doses of 250 mg Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) Tablets. A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of oral terbinafine that included children 4-12 years of age and adults 18-45 years of age (N=113) found that clearance (CL/F) of terbinafine is dependent on body weight in a nonlinear manner. For a typical child of 25 kg CL/F was predicted to be 19 L/h and for a typical adult of 70 kg body weight it was predicted to be 27 L/h. Over the weight range for pediatric patients included in the analysis (14.1 kg-68 kg), the predicted CL/F ranged between 15.6-26.7 L/hr. In plasma, terbinafine is >99% bound to plasma proteins. Prior to excretion, terbinafine is rapidly and extensively metabolized by at least 7 CYP isoenzymes with major contributions from CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19. No metabolites have been identified that have antifungal activity similar to terbinafine. Approximately 70% of the administered dose is eliminated in the urine. In adult patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤50 mL/min) or hepatic cirrhosis, the clearance of terbinafine is decreased by approximately 50% compared to normal volunteers.
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.4     Microbiology
                     
                        Terbinafine, an allylamine antifungal, inhibits biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membrane, via inhibition of squalene epoxidase enzyme. This results in fungal cell death primarily due to the increased membrane permeability mediated by the accumulation of high concentrations of squalene but not due to ergosterol deficiency. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species tested in vitro, terbinafine may be fungicidal.  However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown.
                        Lamisil Oral Granules has been studied in tinea capitis [see Clinical Studies (14)].
