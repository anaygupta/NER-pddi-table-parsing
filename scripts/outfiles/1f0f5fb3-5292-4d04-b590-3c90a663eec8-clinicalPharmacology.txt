CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY




General

                                Propranolol
                                    is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent
                                    possessing no other autonomic nervous system activity. It
                                    specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating
                                    agents for available receptor sites. When access to
                                    beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, chronotropic,
                                    inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic
                                    stimulation are decreased proportionately. At doses greater than
                                    required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a
                                    quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects
                                    the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane
                                    action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.
                            






Mechanism of Action

                                The effects
                                    of propranolol are due to selective blockade of beta-adrenergic
                                    receptors, leaving alpha-adrenergic responses intact. There are
                                    two well-characterized subtypes of beta receptors (beta
                                    1 and beta2); propranolol interacts with
                                    both subtypes equally. Beta1-adrenergic receptors are
                                    found primarily in the heart. Blockade of cardiac
                                    beta1-adrenergic receptors leads to a decrease in the
                                    activity of both normal and ectopic pacemaker cells and a
                                    decrease in A-V nodal conduction velocity. All of these actions
                                    can contribute to antiarrhythmic activity and control of
                                    ventricular rate during arrhythmias. Blockade of cardiac
                                        beta1-adrenergic receptors also decreases the
                                    myocardial force of contraction and may provoke cardiac
                                    decompensation in patients with minimal cardiac reserve.
                                Beta2-adrenergic receptors are found predominantly in
                                    smooth muscle—vascular, bronchial, gastrointestinal
                                    and genitourinary. Blockade of these receptors results in
                                    constriction. Clinically, propranolol may exacerbate respiratory
                                    symptoms in patients with obstructive pulmonary diseases such as
                                    asthma and emphysema (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).
                                Propranolol’s beta blocking effects are attributable
                                    to its S(-) enantiomer.
                            






Pharmacokinetics
                                And Drug Metabolism




Distribution

                                        Propranolol has a distribution half-life (T½ alpha) of 5-10 minutes and a
                                            volume of distribution of about 4 to 5 L/kg.
                                            Approximately 90% of circulating propranolol is bound to
                                            plasma proteins. The binding is enantiomer-selective.
                                            The S-isomer is preferentially bound to
                                            alpha1 glycoprotein and the R-isomer is
                                            preferentially bound to albumin.
                                    






Metabolism
                                        and Elimination

                                        The
                                            elimination half-life (T½ beta) is
                                            between 2 and 5.5 hours. Propranolol is extensively
                                            metabolized with most metabolites appearing in the
                                            urine. The major metabolites include propranolol
                                            glucuronide, naphthyloxylactic acid, and glucuronic acid
                                            and sulfate conjugates of 4-hydroxy propranolol.
                                            Following single-dose intravenous administration,
                                            side-chain oxidative products account for approximately
                                            40% of the metabolites, direct conjugation products
                                            account for approximately 45-50% of metabolites, and
                                            ring oxidative products account for approximately 10-15%
                                            of metabolites. Of these, only the primary ring
                                            oxidative product (4-hydroxypropranolol) possesses
                                            beta-adrenergic receptor blocking activity.
                                        In
                                            vitro studies have indicated that the aromatic
                                            hydroxylation of propranolol is catalyzed mainly by
                                            polymorphic CYP2D6. Side-chain oxidation is mediated
                                            mainly by CYP1A2 and to some extent by CYP2D6. 4-hydroxy
                                            propranolol is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6.
                                    








Pharmacodynamics

                                As
                                    propranolol concentration increases, so does its beta-blocking
                                    effect, as evidenced by a reduction in exercise-induced
                                    tachycardia (n=6 normal volunteers).
                            






Special Populations




Pediatric

                                        The
                                            pharmacokinetics of propranolol have not been
                                            investigated in patients under 18 years of age.
                                            Propranolol injection is not recommended for treatment
                                            of cardiac arrhythmias in pediatric
                                        patients.
                                    






Geriatric

                                        Elevated propranolol plasma concentrations, a longer
                                            mean elimination half-life (254 vs. 152 minutes), and
                                            decreased systemic clearance (8 vs. 13 mL/kg/min) have
                                            been observed in elderly subjects when compared to young
                                            subjects. However, the apparent volume of distribution
                                            seems to be similar in elderly and young subjects. These
                                            findings suggest that dose adjustment of propranolol
                                            injection may be required for elderly patients (see
                                                PRECAUTIONS).
                                    






Gender

                                        Intravenously administered propranolol was evaluated in
                                            5 women and 6 men. When adjusted for weight, there were
                                            no gender-related differences in elimination half-life,
                                            volume of distribution, protein binding, or systemic
                                            clearance.
                                    






Obesity

                                        In
                                            a study of intravenously administered propranolol, obese
                                            subjects had a higher AUC (161 versus 109
                                            hr·µg/L) and lower total clearance
                                            than did non-obese subjects. Propranolol plasma protein
                                            binding was similar in both groups.
                                    






Renal
                                        Insufficiency

                                        The
                                            pharmacokinetics of propranolol and its metabolites were
                                            evaluated in 15 subjects with varying degrees of renal
                                            function after propranolol administration via the
                                            intravenous and oral routes. When compared with normal
                                            subjects, an increase in fecal excretion of propranolol
                                            conjugates was observed in patients with increased renal
                                            impairment. Propranolol was also evaluated in 5 patients
                                            with chronic renal failure, 6 patients on regular
                                            dialysis, and 5 healthy subjects, following a single
                                            oral dose of 40 mg of propranolol. The peak plasma
                                            concentrations (Cmax) of propranolol in the
                                            chronic renal failure group were 2- to 3-fold higher
                                            (161 ng/mL) than those observed in the dialysis patients
                                            (47 ng/mL) and in the healthy subjects (26 ng/mL).
                                            Propranolol plasma clearance was also reduced in the
                                            patients with chronic renal failure.
                                        Chronic renal failure has been associated with a
                                            decrease in drug metabolism via downregulation of
                                            hepatic cytochrome P450 activity.
                                    






Hepatic
                                        Insufficiency

                                        Propranolol is extensively metabolized by the liver. In
                                            a study conducted in 6 normal subjects and 20 patients
                                            with chronic liver disease, including hepatic cirrhosis,
                                            40 mg of R-propranolol was administered intravenously.
                                            Compared to normal subjects, patients with chronic liver
                                            disease had decreased clearance of propranolol,
                                            increased volume of distribution, decreased
                                            protein-binding, and considerable variation in
                                            half-life. Caution should be exercised when propranolol
                                            is used in this population. Consideration should be
                                            given to lowering the dose of intravenous propranolol in
                                            patients with hepatic insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS).
                                    






Thyroid
                                        Dysfunction

                                        No
                                            pharmacokinetic changes were observed in hyperthyroid or
                                            hypothyroid patients when compared to their
                                            corresponding euthyroid state. Dosage adjustment does
                                            not seem necessary in either patient population based on
                                            pharmacokinetic findings.

                                        Because propranolol’s metabolism involves
                                            multiple pathways in the cytochrome P-450 system
                                            (CYP2D6, 1A2, 2C19), administration of propranolol with

                                        Blood levels of propranolol may be decreased by
                                            administration of propranolol with inducers such as
                                            rifampin and ethanol. Cigarette smoking also induces
                                            hepatic metabolism and has been shown to increase up to
                                            100% the clearance of propranolol, resulting in
                                            decreased plasma concentrations.
                                    






Cardiovascular Drugs




Antiarrhythmics

                                                The AUC of propafenone is increased by more
                                                  than 200% with co-administration of propranolol.
                                                The metabolism of propranolol is reduced by
                                                  co-administration of quinidine, leading to a 2-
                                                  to 3-fold increased blood concentrations and
                                                  greater beta-blockade.
                                                The metabolism of lidocaine is inhibited by
                                                  co-administration of propranolol, resulting in a

Benzodiazepines

                                                Propranolol can inhibit the metabolism of
                                                  diazepam, resulting in increased concentrations
                                                  of diazepam and its metabolites. Diazepam does
                                                  not alter the pharmacokinetics of propranolol.
