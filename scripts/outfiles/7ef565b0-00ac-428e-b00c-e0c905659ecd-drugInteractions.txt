                        Careful observation is required when amantadine hydrochloride is administered concurrently with central nervous system stimulants.
                        Agents with anticholinergic properties may potentiate the anticholinergic-like side effects of amantadine.
                        Coadministration of thioridazine has been reported to worsen the tremor in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease, however, it is not known if other phenothiazines produce a similar response.
                        Coadministration of Dyazide (triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide) resulted in a higher plasma amantadine concentration in a 61-year-old man receiving amantadine hydrochloride, USP 100 mg TID for Parkinson's disease.1 It is not known which of the components of Dyazide contributed to the observation or if related drugs produce a similar response.
                        Coadministration of quinine or quinidine with amantadine was shown to reduce the renal clearance of amantadine by about 30%.
                        The concurrent use of amantadine hydrochloride with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) intranasal has not been evaluated. However, because of the potential for interference between these products, LAIV should not be administered within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after administration of amantadine hydrochloride, unless medically indicated. The concern about possible interference arises from the potential for antiviral drugs to inhibit replication of live vaccine virus. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can be administered at any time relative to use of amantadine hydrochloride.
