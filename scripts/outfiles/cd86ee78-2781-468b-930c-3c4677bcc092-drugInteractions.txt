                           Coumarin-derivative anticoagulants: Prolongation of prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio (INR) have been observed with concomitant use. Monitor INR frequently. (7.1)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Coumarin-Derivative Anticoagulants
                     
                        Prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were observed in patients receiving ZOLINZA concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants. Physicians should monitor PT and INR more frequently in patients concurrently administered ZOLINZA and coumarin derivatives.

                        Severe thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported with concomitant use of ZOLINZA and other HDAC inhibitors (e.g., valproic acid). Monitor platelet count every 2 weeks for the first 2 months.
