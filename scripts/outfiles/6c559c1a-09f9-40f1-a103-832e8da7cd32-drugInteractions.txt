                  Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release should not be used in patients being treated (currently or within the preceding 2 weeks) with MAO Inhibitors [see Contraindications (4.5)].
                  Because of possible effects on blood pressure, dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release should be used cautiously with pressor agents.
                  Methylphenidate may decrease the effectiveness of drugs used to treat hypertension.
                  Dexmethylphenidate is metabolized primarily to d-ritalinic acid by de-esterification and not through oxidative pathways.
                  The effects of gastrointestinal pH alterations on the absorption of dexmethylphenidate from dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release have not been studied. Since the modified release characteristics of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release are pH dependent, the coadministration of antacids or acid suppressants could alter the release of dexmethylphenidate.
                  Human pharmacologic studies have shown that racemic methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone), and tricyclic drugs (e.g., imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine). Downward dose adjustments of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with methylphenidate. It may be necessary to adjust the dosage and monitor plasma drug concentration (or, in the case of coumarin, coagulation times), when initiating or discontinuing methylphenidate.
