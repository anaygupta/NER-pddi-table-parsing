                        The mechanism of action of ketoconazole in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis is unknown.

                        Pharmacodynamic markers for seborrheic dermatitis have not been identified.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        In a pharmacokinetic absorption trial, eighteen subjects, both males and females, with severe seborrheic dermatitis (range 1-14% of body surface area) applied XOLEGEL once daily for 2 weeks. The median total amount of gel applied was 4.6 g (range 1.65–46.3 g). Daily doses ranged from 0.05 to 3.47 g. Mean (± standard deviation [SD]) peak plasma levels were 1.35 (± 3.18) ng/mL on Day 7 (range from <0.1 ng/mL, to 13.9 ng/mL), and 0.80 (± 1.22) ng/mL on Day 14 (range from <0.1 ng/mL to 5.4 ng/mL). Median Tmax was 8 hours on Day 7 and 7 hours on Day 14. Mean (± SD) AUC0-24 values were 20.8 (± 44.7) ng∙h/mL and 15.6 (± 26.4) ng∙h/mL on Day 7 and 14, respectively.
                        The plasma levels from an oral dose of 200 mg ketoconazole taken with a meal are approximately 250 times higher than the resulting plasma levels of ketoconazole following topical application of XOLEGEL.
