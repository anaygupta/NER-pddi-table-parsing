                  Following injection, ABLAVAR binds to blood albumin and has the potential to alter the binding of other drugs that also bind to albumin. No drug interaction reactions were observed in clinical trials. Consider the possibility of ABLAVAR interaction with concomitantly administered medications that bind to albumin. An interaction may enhance or decrease the activity of the concomitant medication [

                     7.1  Warfarin
                     
                        In a clinical trial of 10 patients receiving a stable dose of warfarin, a single dose of ABLAVAR (0.05 mmol/kg) did not alter the anticoagulant activity of warfarin as measured by the International Normalized Ratio (INR).
