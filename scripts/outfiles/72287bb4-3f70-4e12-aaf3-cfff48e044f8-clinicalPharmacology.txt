                  A placebo-controlled study in 38 normal volunteers yielded data for 36 subjects who showed a mean log10 reduction of 3.05 log10 units in total aerobes at 10 minutes following prepping the skin with BETADINEÂ® 5% Sterile Ophthalmic Prep Solution compared with reduction of 1.58 log10 units after prepping with vehicle free of the iodine complex. This placebo-controlled study indicates a mean log10 reduction by the iodine complex compared with the control solution of 1.47 log10 units at 10 minutes and 1.79 log10 units at 45 minutes. The base-line mean aerobic bacterial count was 7,586 organisms per square cm.
