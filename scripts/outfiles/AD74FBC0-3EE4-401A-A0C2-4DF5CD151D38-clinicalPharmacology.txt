CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY





Thallous Chloride Tl 201 Injection with no carrier added has been found to accumulate in viable myocardium in a manner analogous to that of potassium. Experiments employing labeled microspheres in human volunteers have shown that the myocardial distribution of Thallous Chloride Tl 201 Injection correlates well with regional perfusion.In clinical studies, thallium images have been found to visualize areas of infarction as "cold" or nonlabeled regions which are confirmed by electrocardiographic and enzyme changes. Regions of transient myocardial ischemia corresponding to areas perfused by coronary arteries with partial stenoses have been visualized when thallium was administered in conjunction with an exercise stress test.Intravenous administration of Thallous Chloride Tl 201 Injection is characterized by rapid biexponential clearance from the blood with about 91.5% of blood radioactivity disappearing with a half-life of approximately 5 minutes and the remainder with a half-life of about 40 hours. Maximal concentration by normal myocardium occurs at about ten minutes with sustained myocardial retention and adequate concentration in heart muscle to permit gated imaging. In addition, localization occurs in parathyroid adenomas and to a lesser extent in sites of parathyroid hyperplasia and other abnormal tissues such as thyroid adenoma, neoplasia (e.g. parathyroid carcinoma) and sarcoid. Biodistribution is generally proportional to organ blood flow at the time of injection. Blood clearance of Thallous Chloride Tl 201 Injection is primarily by the myocardium, kidneys, thyroid, liver and stomach with the remainder distributing fairly uniformly throughout the body. The dosimetry data in Table 4 reflect this distribution pattern and are based on a biological half-life of 11 days and an effective half-life of 2.4 days. Thallous Chloride Tl 201 Injection is excreted slowly and to an equal extent in both feces and urine.
