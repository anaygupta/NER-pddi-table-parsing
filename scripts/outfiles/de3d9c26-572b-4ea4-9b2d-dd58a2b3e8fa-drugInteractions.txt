                        Avoid coadministration of JEVTANA with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If patients require co-administration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, consider a 25% JEVTANA dose reduction.

                        Cabazitaxel is primarily metabolized through CYP3A [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) may increase plasma concentrations of cabazitaxel. Avoid the co-administration of JEVTANA with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If patients require co-administration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, consider a 25% JEVTANA dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
