                        Propofol Injectable Emulsion is an intravenous                                     sedative-hypnotic agent for use in the induction and maintenance                                     of anesthesia or sedation.  Intravenous injection of a                                     therapeutic dose of propofol induces hypnosis, with minimal                                     excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of                                     injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation).  As                                     with other rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agents, the                                     half-time of the blood-brain equilibration is approximately                                     1 to 3 minutes, accounting for the rate of induction of                                     anesthesia.  The mechanism of action, like all general                                     anesthetics, is poorly understood.  However, propofol                                     is thought to produce its sedative/anesthetic effects by the                                     positive mondulation of the inhibitory function of the                                     neurotransmitter GABA through the ligand-gated GABAA                                     receptors.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Pharmacodynamic properties of propofol are dependent upon                                     the therapeutic blood propofol concentrations.                                      Steady-state propofol blood concentrations are generally                                     proportional to infusion rates.  Undesirable side                                     effects, such as cardiorespiratory depression, are likely to                                     occur at higher blood concentrations which result from bolus                                     dosing or rapid increases in infusion rates.  An                                     adequate interval (3 to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose                                     adjustments in order to assess clinical effects.
                        The hemodynamic effects of Propofol Injectable Emulsion                                     during induction of anesthesia vary.  If spontaneous                                     ventilation is maintained, the major cardiovascular effect is                                     arterial hypotension (sometimes greater than a 30%                                     decrease) with little or no change in heart rate and no                                     appreciable decrease in cardiac output.  If ventilation                                     is assisted or controlled (positive pressure ventilation), there                                     is an increase in the incidence and the degree of depression of                                     cardiac output.  Addition of an opioid, used as a                                     premedicant, further decreases cardiac output and respiratory                                     drive.
                        If anesthesia is continued by infusion of Propofol                                     Injectable Emulsion, the stimulation of endotracheal intubation                                     and surgery may return arterial pressure towards                                     normal.  However, cardiac output may remain                                     depressed.  Comparative clinical studies have shown                                     that the hemodynamic effects of Propofol Injectable Emulsion                                     during induction of anesthesia are generally more pronounced                                     than with other intravenous (IV) induction agents.
                        Induction of anesthesia with Propofol Injectable Emulsion                                     is frequently associated with apnea in both adults and pediatric                                     patients.  In adult patients who received Propofol                                     Injectable Emulsion (2 to 2.5 mg/kg), apnea lasted less than 30                                     seconds in 7% of patients, 30 to 60 seconds in                                     24% of patients, and more than 60 seconds in 12%                                     of patients.  In pediatric patients from birth through                                     16 years of age assessable for apnea who received bolus doses of                                     Propofol Injectable Emulsion (1 to 3.6 mg/kg), apnea lasted less                                     than 30 seconds in 12% of patients, 30 to 60 seconds in                                     10% of patients, and more than 60 seconds in 5%                                     of patients.
                        During maintenance of general anesthesia, Propofol                                     Injectable Emulsion causes a decrease in spontaneous minute                                     ventilation usually associated with an increase in carbon                                     dioxide tension which may be marked depending upon the rate of                                     administration and concurrent use of other medications (e.g.,                                     opioids, sedatives, etc.). 
                        During monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation,                                     attention must be given to the cardiorespiratory effects of                                     Propofol Injectable Emulsion.  Hypotension,                                     oxyhemoglobin desaturation, apnea, and airway obstruction can                                     occur, especially following a rapid bolus of Propofol Injectable                                     Emulsion.  During initiation of MAC sedation, slow                                     infusion or slow injection techniques are preferable over rapid                                     bolus administration. During maintenance of MAC                                     sedation, a variable rate infusion is preferable over                                     intermittent bolus administration in order to minimize                                     undesirable cardiorespiratory effects.  In the elderly,                                     debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or                                     repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC                                     sedation (see

                           ).
                        Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that Propofol                                     Injectable Emulsion is rarely associated with elevation of                                     plasma histamine levels.
                        Preliminary findings in patients with normal intraocular                                     pressure indicate that Propofol Injectable Emulsion produces a                                     decrease in intraocular pressure which may be associated with a                                     concomitant decrease in systemic vascular resistance.
                        Clinical studies indicate that Propofol Injectable                                     Emulsion when used in combination with hypocarbia increases                                     cerebrovascular resistance and decreases cerebral blood flow,                                     cerebral metabolic oxygen consumption, and intracranial                                     pressure.  Propofol Injectable Emulsion does not affect                                     cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in arterial carbon dioxide                                     tension (see

                        Clinical studies indicate that Propofol Injectable                                     Emulsion does not suppress the adrenal response to ACTH. 
                        Animal studies and limited experience in susceptible                                     patients have not indicated any propensity of Propofol                                     Injectable Emulsion to induce malignant hyperthermia.
                        Hemosiderin deposits have been observed in the livers of                                     dogs receiving Propofol Injectable Emulsion containing                                     0.005% disodium edetate over a four-week period; the                                     clinical significance of this is unknown.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of propofol are well described by a                                     three compartment linear model with compartments representing                                     the plasma, rapidly equilibrating tissues, and slowly                                     equilibrating tissues.
                        Following an IV bolus dose, there is rapid equilibration                                     between the plasma and the brain, accounting for the rapid onset                                     of anesthesia.  Plasma levels initially decline rapidly                                     as a result of both distribution and metabolic                                     clearance.  Distribution accounts for about half of                                     this decline following a bolus of propofol.  However,                                     distribution is not constant over time, but decreases as body                                     tissues equilibrate with plasma and become saturated.                                      The rate at which equilibration occurs is a function of the rate                                     and duration of the infusion.  When equilibration                                     occurs there is no longer a net transfer of propofol between                                     tissues and plasma.
                        Discontinuation of the recommended doses of Propofol                                     Injectable Emulsion after the maintenance of anesthesia for                                     approximately one hour, or for sedation in the ICU for one day,                                     results in a prompt decrease in blood propofol concentrations                                     and rapid awakening.  Longer infusions (10 days of ICU                                     sedation) result in accumulation of significant tissue stores of                                     propofol, such that the reduction in circulating propofol is                                     slowed and the time to awakening is increased.
                        By daily titration of Propofol Injectable Emulsion dosage                                     to achieve only the minimum effective therapeutic concentration,                                     rapid awakening within 10 to 15 minutes can occur even after                                     long-term administration.  If, however, higher than                                     necessary infusion levels have been maintained for a long time,                                     propofol redistribution from fat and muscle to the plasma can be                                     significant and slow recovery.
                        The figure below illustrates the fall of plasma propofol                                     levels following infusions of various durations to provide ICU                                     sedation. 
                        
                            
                        The large contribution of distribution (about                                     50%) to the fall of propofol plasma levels following                                     brief infusions means that after very long infusions a reduction                                     in the infusion rate is appropriate by as much as half the                                     initial infusion rate in order to maintain a constant plasma                                     level.  Therefore, failure to reduce the infusion rate                                     in patients receiving Propofol Injectable Emulsion for extended                                     periods may result in excessively high blood concentrations of                                     the drug.  Thus, titration to clinical response and                                     daily evaluation of sedation levels are important during use of                                     Propofol Injectable Emulsion infusion for ICU sedation.

                        Propofol clearance ranges from 23 to 50 mL/kg/min (1.6 to                                     3.4 L/min in 70 kg adults).  It is chiefly eliminated                                     by hepatic conjugation to inactive metabolites which are                                     excreted by the kidney.  A glucuronide conjugate                                     accounts for about 50% of the administered                                     dose.  Propofol has a steady-state volume of                                     distribution (10-day infusion) approaching 60 L/kg in healthy                                     adults.  A difference in pharmacokinetics due to gender                                     has not been observed.  The terminal half-life of                                     propofol after a 10-day infusion is 1 to 3 days.

                        With increasing patient age, the dose of propofol needed                                     to achieve a defined anesthetic end point (dose-requirement)                                     decreases.  This does not appear to be an age-related                                     change in pharmacodynamics or brain sensitivity, as measured by                                     EEG burst suppression.  With increasing patient age,                                     pharmacokinetic changes are such that, for a given IV bolus                                     dose, higher peak plasma concentrations occur, which can explain                                     the decreased dose requirement.  These higher peak                                     plasma concentrations in the elderly can predispose patients to                                     cardiorespiratory effects including hypotension, apnea, airway                                     obstruction, and/or arterial oxygen desaturation.  The                                     higher plasma levels reflect an age-related decrease in volume                                     of distribution and intercompartmental clearance.                                      Lower doses are therefore recommended for initiation and                                     maintenance of sedation and anesthesia in elderly patients (see

                        The pharmacokinetics of propofol were studied in children                                     between 3 and 12 years of age who received Propofol Injectable                                     Emulsion for periods of approximately 1 to 2 hours.                                      The observed distribution and clearance of propofol in these                                     children were similar to adults.

                        Propofol Injectable Emulsion was studied in patients                                     undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial tumors in two clinical                                     trials.  The mean lesion size (anterior/posterior x                                     lateral) was 31 mm x 32 mm in one trial and 55 mm x 42 mm in the                                     other trial respectively.  Anesthesia was induced with                                     a median Propofol dose of 1.4 mg/kg (range: 0.9 to 6.9 mg/kg)                                     and maintained with a median maintenance Propofol dose of 146                                     mcg/kg/min (range: 68 to 425 mcg/kg/min).  The median                                     duration of the Propofol maintenance infusion was 285 minutes                                     (range: 48 to 622 minutes).
                        Propofol Injectable Emulsion was administered by infusion                                     in a controlled clinical trial to evaluate its effect on                                     cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP).  The mean arterial                                     pressure was maintained relatively constant over 25 minutes with                                     a change from baseline of -4% ± 17%                                     (mean ± SD).  The change in CSFP was                                     -46% ± 14%.  As CSFP is an                                     indirect measure of intracranial pressure (ICP), Propofol                                     Injectable Emulsion, when given by infusion or slow bolus in                                     combination with hypocarbia, is capable of decreasing ICP                                     independent of changes in arterial pressure.

                        Propofol Injectable Emulsion was compared to                                     benzodiazepines and opioids in clinical trials involving ICU                                     patients.  Of these, 302 received Propofol Injectable                                     Emulsion and comprise the overall safety database for ICU                                     sedation.  
                        Across all clinical studies, the mean infusion                                     maintenance rate for all Propofol Injectable Emulsion patients                                     was 27 ± 21 mcg/kg/min.  The maintenance                                     infusion rates required to maintain adequate sedation ranged                                     from 2.8 mcg/kg/min to 130 mcg/kg/min.  The infusion                                     rate was lower in patients over 55 years of age (approximately                                     20 mcg/kg/min) compared to patients under 55 years of age                                     (approximately 38 mcg/kg/min).  Although there are                                     reports of reduced analgesic requirements, most patients                                     received opioids for analgesia during maintenance of ICU                                     sedation.  In these studies, morphine or fentanyl was                                     used as needed for analgesia.  Some patients also                                     received benzodiazepines and/or neuromuscular blocking                                     agents.  During long-term maintenance of sedation, some                                     ICU patients were awakened once or twice every 24 hours for                                     assessment of neurologic or respiratory function. 
                        In Medical and Postsurgical ICU studies comparing                                     Propofol Injectable Emulsion to benzodiazepine infusion or                                     bolus, there were no apparent differences in maintenance of                                     adequate sedation, mean arterial pressure, or laboratory                                     findings.  Like the comparators, Propofol Injectable                                     Emulsion reduced blood cortisol during sedation while                                     maintaining responsivity to challenges with adrenocorticotropic                                     hormone (ACTH).  Case reports from the published                                     literature generally reflect that Propofol Injectable Emulsion                                     has been used safely in patients with a history of porphyria or                                     malignant hyperthermia.
                        In hemodynamically stable head trauma patients ranging in                                     age from 19 to 43 years, adequate sedation was maintained with                                     Propofol Injectable Emulsion or morphine.  There were                                     no apparent differences in adequacy of sedation, intracranial                                     pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, or neurologic recovery                                     between the treatment groups.  In literature reports of                                     severely head‑injured patients in Neurosurgical ICUs,                                     Propofol Injectable Emulsion infusion and hyperventilation, both                                     with and without diuretics, controlled intracranial pressure                                     while maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure.  In some                                     patients, bolus doses resulted in decreased blood pressure and                                     compromised cerebral perfusion pressure. 
                        Propofol Injectable Emulsion was found to be effective in                                     status epilepticus which was refractory to the standard                                     anticonvulsant therapies.  For these patients, as well                                     as for ARDS/respiratory failure and tetanus patients, sedation                                     maintenance dosages were generally higher than those for other                                     critically ill patient populations.

Patients were randomized to receive either                                     Propofol 2%, (113 patients), Propofol 1%, (109                                     patients), or an SSA (eg, lorazepam, chloral hydrate, fentanyl,                                     ketamine, morphine, or phenobarbital).  Propofol                                     therapy was initiated at an infusion rate of 5.5 mg/kg/hr and                                     titrated as needed to maintain sedation at a standardized level.                                      The results of the study showed an increase in the                                     number of deaths in patients treated with Propofol as compared                                     to SSAs.  Of the 25 patients who died during the trial                                     or within the 28-day follow-up period: 12 (11% were) in                                     the Propofol 2% treatment group, 9 (8% were) in                                     the Propofol 1% treatment group, and 4% were                                     (4%) in the SSA treatment group.  The                                     differences in mortality rate between the groups were not                                     statistically significant.  Review of the deaths failed                                     to reveal a correlation with underlying disease status or a                                     correlation to the drug or a definitive pattern to the causes of                                     death.

                        Propofol Injectable Emulsion was evaluated in clinical                                     trials involving patients undergoing coronary artery bypass                                     graft (CABG).  
                        In post-CABG (coronary artery bypass graft) patients, the                                     maintenance rate of propofol administration was usually low                                     (median 11 mcg/kg/min) due to the intraoperative administration                                     of high opioid doses.  Patients receiving Propofol                                     Injectable Emulsion required 35% less nitroprusside than                                     midazolam patients.  During initiation of sedation in                                     post-CABG patients, a 15% to 20% decrease in                                     blood pressure was seen in the first 60 minutes.  It                                     was not possible to determine cardiovascular effects in patients                                     with severely compromised ventricular function.
