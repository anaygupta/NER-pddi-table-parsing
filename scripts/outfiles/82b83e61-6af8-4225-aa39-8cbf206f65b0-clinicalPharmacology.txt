                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Gadoterate is a paramagnetic molecule that develops a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field. The magnetic moment enhances the relaxation rates of water protons in its vicinity, leading to an increase in signal intensity (brightness) of tissues. 
                        In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occurs with:
                        
                           differences in proton density
                           differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1)
                           differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T2)
                        
                        When placed in a magnetic field, gadoterate shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in target tissues. At recommended doses, the effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in the T1-weighted sequences.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
              
                     
                        Gadoterate affects proton relaxation times and consequently the MR signal, and the contrast obtained is characterized by the relaxivity of the gadoterate molecule. The relaxivity values for gadoterate are similar across the spectrum of magnetic field strengths used in clinical MRI (0.2 - 1.5 T).
                        Gadoterate does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier and, therefore, does not enhance normal brain or lesions that have a normal blood-brain barrier, e.g. cysts, mature post-operative scars. However, disruption of the blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity allows distribution of gadoterate in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and infarcts.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
              
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of total gadolinium following an intravenously administered 0.1 mmol/kg dose of DOTAREM in normal subjects conform to a one-compartment open-model with a mean elimination half-life (reported as mean ± SD) of about 1.4 ± 0.2 hr and 2.0 ± 0.7 hr in female and male subjects, respectively. Similar pharmacokinetic profile and elimination half-life values were observed after intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of DOTAREM followed 20 minutes later by a second injection of 0.2 mmol/kg (1.7 ± 0.3 hr and 1.9 ± 0.2 hr in female and male subjects, respectively).
                        
                           Distribution
                        
                        The volume of distribution at steady state of total gadolinium in normal subjects is 179 ± 26 and 211 ± 35 mL/kg in female and male subjects respectively, roughly equivalent to that of extracellular water.
                        Gadoterate does not undergo protein binding in vitro. The extent of blood cell partitioning of gadoterate is not known. 
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        Gadoterate is not known to be metabolized.
                        
                           Elimination
                        
                        Following a 0.1 mmol/kg dose of DOTAREM, total gadolinium is excreted primarily in the urine with 72.9 ± 17.0 % and 85.4 ± 9.7 % (mean ± SD) eliminated within 48 hours, in female and male subjects, respectively. Similar values were achieved after a cumulative dose of 0.3 mmol/kg (0.1 + 0.2 mmol/kg, 20 minutes later), with 85.5 ± 13.2 % and 92.0 ± 12.0 % recovered in urine within 48 hrs in female and male subjects respectively.
                        In healthy subjects, the renal and total clearance rates of total gadolinium are comparable (1.27 ± 0.32 and 1.74 ± 0.12 mL/min/kg in females; and 1.40 ± 0.31 and 1.64 ± 0.35 mL/min/kg in males, respectively) indicating that the drug is primarily cleared through the kidneys. Within the studied dose range (0.1 to 0.3 mmol/kg), the kinetics of total gadolinium appear to be linear.

                           Renal Impairment
                        
                        A single intravenous dose of 0.1 mmol/kg of DOTAREM was administered to 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) with impaired renal function (mean serum creatinine of 498 ± 98 µmol/L in the 10 - 30 mL/min creatinine clearance group and 192 ± 62 µmol/L in the 30-60 mL/min creatinine clearance group). Renal impairment delayed the elimination of total gadolinium. Total clearance decreased as a function of the degree of renal impairment. The distribution volume was unaffected by the severity of renal impairment (Table 5). No changes in renal function test parameters were observed after DOTAREM injection. The mean cumulative urinary excretion of total gadolinium was approximately 76.9 ± 4.5% in 48 hrs in patients with moderate renal impairment, 68.4 ± 3.5% in 72 hrs in patients with severe renal impairment and 93.3 ± 4.7% in 24 hrs for subjects with normal renal function.
