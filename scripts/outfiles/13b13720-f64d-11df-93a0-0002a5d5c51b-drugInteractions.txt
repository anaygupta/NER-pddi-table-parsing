                           Beta Blockers
                        
                        In most patients, Cardene ® I.V. can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, titrate slowly when using Cardene ® I.V. in combination with a beta-blocker in heart failure patients. 
                        
                           Cimetidine
                        
                        Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Frequently monitor response in patients receiving both drugs. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available. 
                        
                           Cyclosporine
                        
                        Concomitant administration of oral nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during Cardene ® I.V. administration, and reduce the dose of cyclosporine accordingly. 
                        
                           In Vitro Interaction
                        
                        The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro.
