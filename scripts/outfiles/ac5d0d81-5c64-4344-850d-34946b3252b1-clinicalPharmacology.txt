                  Choline Magnesium Trisalicylate Liquid contains salicylate with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic action. On ingestion of Choline Magnesium Trisalicylate Liquid, the salicylate moiety is absorbed rapidly and reaches peak blood levels within an average of one to two hours after single dose of the liquid. The primary route of excretion is renal: the excretion products are chiefly the glycine and glucuronide conjugates. At higher serum salicylate concentrations, the glycine conjugation pathway becomes rapidly saturated. Thus, the slower glucuronide conjugation pathway becomes the rate limiting step for salicylate excretion. In addition, salicylate excreted in the bile as glucuronide conjugate may be reabsorbed. These factors account for the prolongation of salicylate half-life and the nonlinear increase in plasma salicylate level as the salicylate dose is increased. The serum concentration of salicylate is increased by conditions that decrease glomerular filtration rate or proximal tubular secretion.
                  Unlike aspirin and certain other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as arylpropionic acid derivatives and arylacetic acid derivatives, choline magnesium trisalicylate at therapeutic dosage levels does not affect platelet aggregation, as shown by in-vitro and in-vivo studies.
