                  12.1 Mechanism of ActionCodeine sulfate is an opioid analgesic, related to morphine, but 
with less potent analgesic properties. Codeine is selective for the mu receptor, 
but with a much weaker affinity than morphine. The analgesic properties of 
codeine have been speculated to come from its conversion to morphine, although 
the exact mechanism of analgesic action remains unknown.
                  
                  
                  Effects of the Central Nervous System (CNS)The principal therapeutic action of codeine sulfate is analgesia. 
Although the precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown, specific CNS 
opiate receptors and endogenous compounds with morphine-like activity have been 
identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are likely to play a role in 
the expression and perception of analgesic effects. Some other CNS effects of 
codeine include anxiolysis, euphoria, and feelings of relaxation. Codeine 
sulfate causes respiratory depression, in part by a direct effect on the 
brainstem respiratory centers. Codeine sulfate and other related opioids depress 
the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Codeine 
sulfate may also cause miosis. 
                  
                  
                  Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and on Other 
Smooth MuscleGastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions may be decreased by 
codeine. Codeine also causes a reduction in motility and is associated with an 
increase in tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in 
the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. 
Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased 
to the point of spasm. The end result may be constipation. Codeine can cause a 
marked increase in biliary tract pressure as a result of the spasm of the 
sphincter of Oddi. Codeine may also cause spasms of the sphincter of the urinary 
bladder. 
                  
                  
                  Effects on the Cardiovascular SystemCodeine produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in 
orthostatic hypotension and fainting. Release of histamine can occur, which may 
play a role in opioid-induced hypotension. Manifestations of histamine release 
and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and 
sweating. 
                  
                  
                  Endocrine SystemOpioid agonists such as codeine sulfate have been shown to have a 
variety of effects on the secretion of hormones. Opioids inhibit the secretion 
of ACTH, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate 
prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin 
and glucagons in humans and other species, rats and dogs. Thyroid stimulating 
hormone (TSH) has been shown to be both inhibited and stimulated by 
opioids.
                  
                  
                  Immune SystemCodeine has been shown to have a variety of effects on components 
of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. 
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.
                  
                  
                  12.2 PharmacodynamicsCodeine concentrations do not correlate with brain concentration 
or relief of pain.
                  The minimum effective concentration varies widely and is influenced by a 
variety of factors, including the extent of previous opioid use, age and general 
medical condition. Effective doses in tolerant patients may be significantly 
higher than in opioid-na√Øve patients.
                  
                  
                  12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                  
                  AbsorptionCodeine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with maximum 
plasma concentration occurring 60 minutes post administration. 
                  
                  
                  Food EffectsWhen 60 mg codeine sulfate was administered 30 minutes after 
ingesting a high fat/high calorie meal, there was no significant change in the 
rate and extent of absorption of codeine. 
                  
                  
                  Steady-stateAdministration of 15 mg codeine sulfate every four hours for 5 
days resulted in steady-state concentrations of codeine, morphine, 
morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) within 48 
hours.
                  
                  
                  DistributionCodeine has been reported to have an apparent volume of 
distribution of approximately 3-6 L/kg, indicating extensive distribution of the 
drug into tissues. Codeine has low plasma protein binding with about 7-25% of 
codeine bound to plasma proteins.
                  
                  
                  MetabolismAbout 70-80% of the administered dose of codeine is metabolized 
by conjugation with glucuronic acid to codeine-6-glucuronide (C6G) and via O-demethylation to morphine (about 5-10%) and N-demethylation to norcodeine (about 10%) respectively. 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B4 are the major enzymes mediating 
glucurodination of codeine to C6G. Cytochrome P450 2D6 is the major enzyme 
responsible for conversion of codeine to morphine and P450 3A4 is the major 
enzyme mediating conversion of codeine to norcodeine. Morphine and norcodeine 
are further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. The glucuronide 
metabolites of morphine are morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and 
morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). Morphine and M6G are known to have analgesic 
activity in humans. The analgesic activity of C6G in humans is unknown. 
Norcodeine and M3G are generally not considered to possess analgesic properties. 

                  
                  
                  EliminationApproximately 90% of the total dose of codeine is excreted 
through the kidneys, of which approximately 10% is unchanged codeine. Plasma 
half-lives of codeine and its metabolites have been reported to be approximately 
3 hours.
