<tr>
<td>Drugs that Affect Renal Function</td>
<td>A decline in GFR or tubular secretion, as from ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS], COX-2 inhibitors may impair the excretion of digoxin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Antiarrthymics</td>
<td>Dofetilide</td>
<td>Concomitant administration with digoxin was associated with a higher rate of torsades de pointes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>Sotalol</td>
<td>Proarrhythmic events were more common in patients receiving sotalol and digoxin than on either alone; it is not clear whether this represents an interaction or is related to the presence of CHF, a known risk factor for proarrhythmia, in patients receiving digoxin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>Dronedarone</td>
<td>Sudden death was more common in patients receiving digoxin with dronedarone than on either alone; it is not clear whether this represents an interaction or is related to the presence of advanced heart disease, a known risk factor for sudden death in patients receiving digoxin. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Parathyroid Hormone Analog</td>
<td>Teriparatide</td>
<td>Sporadic case reports have suggested that hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Teriparatide transiently increases serum calcium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thyroid supplement</td>
<td>Thyroid</td>
<td>Treatment of hypothyroidism in patients taking digoxin may increase the dose requirements of digoxin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sympathomimetics</td>
<td>Epinephrine<br/>Norepinephrine     <br/>Dopamine</td>
<td>Can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Neuromuscular Blocking Agents     </td>
<td>Succinylcholine</td>
<td>May cause sudden extrusion of potassium from muscle cells causing arrhythmias in patients taking digoxin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Supplements</td>
<td>Calcium</td>
<td>If administered rapidly by intravenous route, can produce serious arrhythmias in digitalized patients.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers</td>
<td> </td>
<td>Additive effects on AV node conduction can result in bradycardia and advanced or complete heart block.</td>
