                     7.1 Warfarin
                     
                        Concomitant administration of econazole and warfarin has resulted in enhancement of anticoagulant effect. Most cases reported product application with use under occlusion, genital application, or application to a large body surface area which may increase the systemic absorption of econazole nitrate. Monitoring of International Normalized Ratio (INR) and/or prothrombin time may be indicated especially for patients who apply econazole to large body surface areas, in the genital area, or under occlusion.
