                        Concominant use with metoclopramide, beta-blockers, or cholinomimetics and anticholinergic medications is not recommended. (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.1 Metoclopramide 
                     
                     
                        Due to the risk of additive extra-pyramidal adverse reactions, the concomitant use of metoclopramide and Rivastigmine Patch is not recommended.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.2 Cholinomimetic and Anticholinergic 
                        Medications
                     
                     
                        Rivastigmine Patch may increase the cholinergic effects of other cholinomimetic medications and may also interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (e.g., oxybutynin, tolterodine). Concomitant use of Rivastigmine Patch with medications having these pharmacologic effects is not recommended unless deemed clinically necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.3 Beta-blockers 
                     
                     
                        Additive bradycardic effects resulting in syncope may occur when rivastigmine is used concomitantly with beta-blockers, especially cardioselective beta-blockers (including atenolol). Concomitant use is not recommended when signs of bradycardia including syncope are present.
