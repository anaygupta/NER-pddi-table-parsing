                     12.1	Mechanism of Action 
                     
                        The active ingredient of Asclera is polidocanol.
                        Polidocanol is a sclerosing agent that locally damages the endothelium of blood vessels. When injected intravenously, polidocanol induces endothelial damage. Platelets then aggregate at the site of damage and attach to the venous wall. Eventually, a dense network of platelets, cellular debris, and fibrin occludes the vessel. Finally, the occluded vein is replaced with connective fibrous tissue.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Polidocanol has a concentration- and volume-dependent damaging effect on the endothelium of blood vessels.

                        During the major effectiveness study (EASI-trial), scheduled blood samples were taken from a sub-group of 22 patients to measure plasma levels of polidocanol after Asclera treatment of spider and reticular veins. Low systemic blood levels of polidocanol were seen in some patients.
                        The mean t1/2 of polidocanol in 4 patients with evaluable data receiving 4.5 -18.0 mg was 1.5 h.
