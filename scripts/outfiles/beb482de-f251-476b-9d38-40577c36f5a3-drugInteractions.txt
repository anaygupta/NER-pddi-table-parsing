                           Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit RANEXA to 500 mg twice daily. (
          
  
     7.1)
         
 
    
                           P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate RANEXA based on clinical response. (
          
  
     7.1)
         
 
    
                           CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with RANEXA.  Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with RANEXA. (
          
  
     7.2)
         
 
    
                           OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with RANEXA 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. (
          
  
     7.2)
         
 
    
                           Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with RANEXA. (

                              In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of RANEXA 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When RANEXA 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with RANEXA 500 mg twice daily
