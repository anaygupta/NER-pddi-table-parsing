                        ISOPLATE SOLUTION contains the following key components to maintain platelet function:
                        
                           Sodium chloride for osmolarity
                           Acetate to fuel platelet metabolism
                           Gluconate or phosphate for buffering
                           Magnesium and potassium to reduce platelet activation1,2
                           
                        
                        This solution has no pharmacological effect; the solution provides the appropriate components for platelet function while allowing for a lower volume of plasma in the platelet product during storage.
