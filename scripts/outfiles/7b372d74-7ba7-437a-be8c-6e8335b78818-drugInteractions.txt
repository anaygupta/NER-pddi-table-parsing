                        Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine. Use cautiously with pressor agents.
                        Human pharmacologic studies have shown that Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, primidone), phenylbutazone, and tricyclic drugs (imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine). Downward dosage adjustments of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution.
