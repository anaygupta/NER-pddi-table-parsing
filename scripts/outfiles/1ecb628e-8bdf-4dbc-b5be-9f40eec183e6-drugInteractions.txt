                           Oral Anticoagulants
                           
                              
                                 CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN COUMARIN ANTICOAGULANTS
ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH TRICOR.  THE DOSAGE OF THE ANTICOAGULANTS
SHOULD BE REDUCED TO MAINTAIN THE PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR AT THE DESIRED
LEVEL TO PREVENT BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS.  FREQUENT PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR
DETERMINATIONS ARE ADVISABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY DETERMINED
THAT THE PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR HAS STABILIZED.
                              
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors
                           
                              The combined use
of TRICOR and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be avoided unless
the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh
the increased risk of this drug combination (see WARNINGS).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Resins
                           
                              Since bile acid
sequestrants may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should
take TRICOR at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a bile acid
binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Cyclosporine
                           
                              Because cyclosporine
can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance
and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the
primary elimination route of fibrate drugs including TRICOR, there
is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration.  The benefits
and risks of using TRICOR (fenofibrate tablets) with immunosuppressants
and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered,
and the lowest effective dose employed.
