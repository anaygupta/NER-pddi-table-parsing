                     7.1  Rifampin/Rifabutin
                     
                        Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin and MEPRON suspension is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant administration of MEPRON suspension and rifampin or rifabutin is not recommended.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2  Tetracycline
                     
                        Concomitant administration of tetracycline and MEPRON suspension has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be used when prescribing tetracycline concomitantly with MEPRON suspension. Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of MEPRON if coadministration is necessary.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3  Metoclopramide
                     
                        Metoclopramide may reduce the bioavailability of atovaquone and should be used only if other antiemetics are not available [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4  Indinavir
                     
                        Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised when prescribing MEPRON suspension with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir. Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of indinavir if coadministration with MEPRON suspension is necessary.
