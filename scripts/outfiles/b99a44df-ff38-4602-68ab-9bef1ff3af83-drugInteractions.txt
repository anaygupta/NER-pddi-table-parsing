                                 Potentially Arrhythmogenic
Agents:
                              
                            Any drug known to have the potential to prolong the QT interval
should not be used together with droperidol. Possible pharmacodynamic interactions
can occur between droperidol and potentially arrhythmogenic agents such as
class I or III antiarrhythmics, antihistamines that prolong the QT interval,
antimalarials, calcium channel blockers, neuroleptics that prolong the QT
interval, and antidepressants.
                        Caution should be used
when patients are taking concomitant drugs known to induce hypokalemia or
hypomagnesemia as they may precipitate QT prolongation and interact with droperidol.
These would include diuretics, laxatives and supraphysiological use of steroid
hormones with mineralocorticoid potential.
                        
                           
                              
                                 CNS Depressant Drugs:
                              
                            Other CNS depressant
drugs (e.g., barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids and general anesthetics)
have additive or potentiating effects with droperidol. Following the administration
of droperidol, the dose of other CNS depressant drugs should be reduced.
