                        Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. and data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions.

                           CYP3A Inhibitors
                           
                              CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (azithromycin, although structurally related to to the class of macrolide antibiotic, is void of clinically relevant CYP3A inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications.

                              Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See ).

                                          Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A . Coadministraion of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased C and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine.

                                          Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding C values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered.

A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril.

                                          studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics.

                                          No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected.

                                    Nifedipine extended-release tablet was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended, and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered.
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                          Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol.

                                          Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and C of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and C of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine and dose reduction of nifedipine considered.

                                          The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentration of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablet, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablet to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.

                                          Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The C values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine bycimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored, and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered.

                                          drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and C for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered.

                                          Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced C and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively.

                                          Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus . Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus, the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered.

                                          Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for C and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

                                          A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin C and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. T and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin.

                                          In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministered of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and C by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 × 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and C of nifedipine by a factor of 2.0. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine.

                                          St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary.

                                          In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6.
