                  No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with TAZORAC® Cream.

                  In a trial of 27 healthy female subjects between the ages of 20–55 years receiving a combination oral contraceptive tablet containing 1 mg norethindrone and 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol, concomitant use of tazarotene administered as 1.1 mg orally (mean ± SD Cmax and AUC0-24 of tazarotenic acid were 28.9 ± 9.4 ng/mL and 120.6 ± 28.5 ng∙hr/mL) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol over a complete cycle.

                  The impact of tazarotene on the pharmacokinetics of progestin only oral contraceptives (i.e., minipills) has not been evaluated.
