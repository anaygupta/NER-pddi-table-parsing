                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The active ingredients of Edarbyclor target two separate mechanisms involved in blood pressure regulation. Azilsartan blocks the vasoconstriction and sodium retaining effects of angiotensin II on cardiac, vascular smooth muscle, adrenal and renal cells. Chlorthalidone produces diuresis with increased excretion of sodium and chloride at the cortical diluting segment of the ascending limb of Henle's loop of the nephron.
                        
                           Azilsartan
                           
                           medoxomil
                        
                        Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE, kinase II). Angiotensin II is the principle pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Azilsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1  receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathway for angiotensin II synthesis.
                        An AT2  receptor is also found in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Azilsartan has more than a 10,000-fold greater affinity for the AT1  receptor than for the AT2  receptor.
                        Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction catalyzed by ACE. Because azilsartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase II), it should not affect bradykinin levels. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Azilsartan does not bind to or block other receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.
                        Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of azilsartan on blood pressure.
                        
                           Chlorthalidone
                        
                        Chlorthalidone produces diuresis with increased excretion of sodium and chloride. The site of action appears to be the cortical diluting segment of the ascending limb of Henle's loop of the nephron. The diuretic effects of chlorthalildone lead to decreased extracellular fluid volume, plasma volume, cardiac output, total exchangeable sodium, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow. Although the mechanism of action of chlorthalidone and related drugs is not wholly clear, sodium and water depletion appear to provide a basis for its antihypertensive effect.

                           Edarbyclor
                        
                        Edarbyclor tablets have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. Both azilsartan medoxomil and chlorthalidone lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance but through complementary mechanisms. 
                        
                           Azilsartan
                           
                           medoxomil
                        
                        Azilsartan inhibits the pressor effects of an angiotensin II infusion in a dose-related manner. An azilsartan single dose equivalent to 32 mg azilsartan medoxomil inhibited the maximal pressor effect by approximately 90% at peak, and approximately 60% at 24 hours. Plasma angiotensin I and II concentrations and plasma renin activity increased while plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased after single and repeated administration of azilsartan medoxomil to healthy subjects; no clinically significant effects on serum potassium or sodium were observed.
                        
                           Chlorthalidone
                        
                        The diuretic effect of chlorthalidone occurs in approximately 2.6 hours and continues for up to 72 hours.

                           Edarbyclor
                        
                        Following oral administration of Edarbyclor, peak plasma concentrations of azilsartan and chlorthalidone are reached at 3 and 1 hours, respectively. The rate (Cmax  and Tmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption of azilsartan are similar when it is administered alone or with chlorthalidone. The extent (AUC) of absorption of chlorthalidone is similar when it is administered alone or with azilsartan medoxomil; however, the Cmax  of chlorthalidone from Edarbyclor was 47% higher. The elimination half-lives of azilsartan and chlorthalidone are approximately 12 hours and 45 hours, respectively. 
                        There is no clinically significant effect of food on the bioavailability of Edarbyclor.
                        
                           Azilsartan
                           
                           medoxomil
                        
                        
                           Absorption: Azilsartan medoxomil is rapidly hydrolyzed to azilsartan, the active metabolite, in the gastrointestinal tract during absorption. Azilsartan medoxomil is not detected in plasma after oral administration. Dose proportionality in exposure was established for azilsartan in the azilsartan medoxomil dose range of 20 mg to 320 mg after single or multiple dosing. 
                        The estimated absolute bioavailability of azilsartan following administration of azilsartan medoxomil is approximately 60%. After oral administration of azilsartan medoxomil, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of azilsartan are reached within 1.5 to 3 hours. Food does not affect the bioavailability of azilsartan.

                           medoxomil
                           : The volume of distribution of azilsartan is approximately 16L. Azilsartan is highly bound to human plasma proteins (>99%), mainly serum albumin. Protein binding is constant at azilsartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. 
                        In rats, minimal azilsartan-associated radioactivity crossed the blood-brain barrier. Azilsartan passed across the placental barrier in pregnant rats and was distributed to the fetus.
                        
                           Chlorthalidone
                           :  In whole blood, chlorthalidone is predominantly bound to erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase. In the plasma, approximately 75% of chlorthalidone is bound to plasma proteins, 58% of the drug being bound to albumin.

                           Azilsartan
                           
                           medoxomil
                           :  Azilsartan is metabolized to two primary metabolites. The major metabolite in plasma is formed by O-dealkylation, referred to as metabolite M-II, and the minor metabolite is formed by decarboxylation, referred to as metabolite M-I. Systemic exposures to the major and minor metabolites in humans were approximately 50% and less than 1% of azilsartan, respectively. M-I and M-II do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of azilsartan medoxomil. The major enzyme responsible for azilsartan metabolism is CYP2C9.
                        Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled azilsartan medoxomil, approximately 55% of radioactivity was recovered in feces and approximately 42% in urine, with 15% of the dose excreted in urine as azilsartan. The elimination half-life of azilsartan is approximately 11 hours and renal clearance is approximately 2.3 mL/min. Steady-state levels of azilsartan are achieved within 5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with repeated once-daily dosing.
                        
                           Chlorthalidone
                           :  The major portion of the drug is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Nonrenal routes of elimination have yet to be clarified. Data are not available regarding percentage of dose as unchanged drug and metabolites, concentration of the drug in body fluids, degree of uptake by a particular organ or in the fetus, or passage across the blood-brain barrier.
