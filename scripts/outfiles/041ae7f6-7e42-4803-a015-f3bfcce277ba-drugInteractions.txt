                  Alprazolam is primarily eliminated by metabolism via cytochrome 
P450 3A (CYP3A). Most of the interactions that have been documented with 
alprazolam are with drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A4.
                  Compounds that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A would be expected to increase 
plasma alprazolam concentrations. Drug products that have been studied in vivo, along with their effect on increasing alprazolam 
AUC, are as follows: ketoconazole, 3.98 fold; itraconazole, 2.7 fold; 
nefazodone, 1.98 fold; fluvoxamine, 1.96 fold; and erythromycin, 1.61 fold (see 

                        CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and 
                        PRECAUTIONS: Drug 
Interactions
                     ).
                  CYP3A inducers would be expected to decrease alprazolam concentrations and 
this has been observed in vivo. The oral clearance of 
alprazolam (given in a 0.8 mg single dose) was increased from 0.9±0.21 mL/min/kg 
to 2.13±0.54 mL/min/kg and the elimination t1/2 was 
shortened (from 17.1±4.9 to 7.7 ±1.7 h) following administration of 300 mg/day 
carbamazepine for 10 days (see 
                        PRECAUTIONS: Drug 
Interactions
                     ). However, the carbamazepine dose used in this study was 
fairly low compared to the recommended doses (1000 to 1200 mg/day); the effect 
at usual carbamazepine doses is unknown.
                  The ability of alprazolam to induce human hepatic enzyme systems has not yet 
been determined. However, this is not a property of benzodiazepines in general. 
Further, alprazolam did not affect the prothrombin or plasma warfarin levels in 
male volunteers administered sodium warfarin orally.
