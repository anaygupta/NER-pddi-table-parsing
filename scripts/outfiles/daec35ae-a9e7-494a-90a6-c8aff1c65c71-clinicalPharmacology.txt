                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The mechanism of action of quetiapine fumarate is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of quetiapine fumarate in schizophrenia and its mood stabilizing properties in bipolar depression and mania are mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D ) and serotonin type 2 (5HT ) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of quetiapine fumarate.

                        Quetiapine fumarate is an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain: serotonin 5HT and 5HT (IC = 717 & 148nM, respectively), dopamine D and D (IC = 1268 & 329nM, respectively), histamine H (IC = 30nM), and adrenergic α and α receptors (IC = 94 & 271nM, respectively). Quetiapine fumarate has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors (IC > 5000 nM).

                        Effect on QT Interval
                        In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval.

                        Adults
                        Quetiapine fumarate activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are dose-proportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and quetiapine accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of about 6 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steady-state concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.
                        Children and Adolescents
                        At steady-state the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound, in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age), were similar to adults. However, when adjusted for dose and weight, AUC and C of the parent compound were 41% and 39% lower, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. For the active metabolite, norquetiapine, AUC and C were 45% and 31% higher, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. When adjusted for dose and weight, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite, norquetiapine, was similar between children and adolescents and adults

                        Quetiapine fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100% bioavailable relative to solution. The bioavailability of quetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with C and AUC values increased by 25% and 15%, respectively.

                        Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 10 ± 4 L/kg. It is 83% bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. , quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin. In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine.

                        Following a single oral dose of C-quetiapine, less than 1% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 73% and 20% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.

                        Quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver. The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation to the sulfoxide metabolite and oxidation to the parent acid metabolite; both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. studies using human liver microsomes revealed that the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of quetiapine to its major, but inactive, sulfoxide metabolite and in the metabolism of its active metabolite N-desalkyl quetiapine.
