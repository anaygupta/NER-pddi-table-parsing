                                 Effects of Telavancin on Coagulation Test Parameters
                              
                              Telavancin binds to the artificial phospholipid surfaces added to common anticoagulation tests, thereby interfering with the ability of the coagulation complexes to assemble on the surface of the phospholipids and promote clotting in vitro. These effects appear to depend on the type of reagents used in commercially available assays. Thus, when measured shortly after completion of an infusion of VIBATIV, increases in the PT, INR, aPTT, and ACT have been observed. These effects dissipate over time, as plasma concentrations of telavancin decrease.

                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Urine Protein Tests
                              
                              Telavancin interferes with urine qualitative dipstick protein assays, as well as quantitative dye methods (e.g., pyrogallol red-molybdate). However, microalbumin assays are not affected and can be used to monitor urinary protein excretion during VIBATIV treatment.
