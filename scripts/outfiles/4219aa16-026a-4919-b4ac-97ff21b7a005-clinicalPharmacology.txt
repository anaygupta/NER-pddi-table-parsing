                     Lidocaine is a topical anesthetic and stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.
                  
                     Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it also acts as a weak kappa (κ) opioid receptor agonist.  Menthol acts to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM-8 receptors in the skin  - responsible for the well-known cooling sensation it stimulates when applied directly to the skin. Menthol's analgesic properties are not fully understood, however they are mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue.
