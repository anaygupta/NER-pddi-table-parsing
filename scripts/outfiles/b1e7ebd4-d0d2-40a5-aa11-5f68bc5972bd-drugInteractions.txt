                      7.1	Anti-hypertensives / Cardiac Glycosides 
                     
                        Alpha-2 agonists, as a class, may reduce blood pressure.  Caution in using drugs such as beta-blockers (ophthalmic and systemic), anti-hypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides is advised.

                        Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with Brimonidine Tartrate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.15%, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                      7.3	Tricyclic Antidepressants 
                     
                        Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine.  It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with Brimonidine Tartrate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.15% in humans can lead to resulting interference with its IOP-lowering effect.  Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants, which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                      7.4	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors 
                     
                        Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension.  Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines
