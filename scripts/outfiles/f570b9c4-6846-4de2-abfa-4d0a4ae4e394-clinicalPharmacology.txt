                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was studied in patients over a dose range of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg administered as a single dose or as multiple doses of OPDIVO every 2 or 3 weeks. Based on a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis using data from 909 patients, the geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) clearance (CL) is 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) is 8.0 L (30.4%), and geometric mean elimination half-life (t1/2) is 26.7 days (101%). Steady-state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 12 weeks when administered at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic accumulation was approximately 3-fold. The exposure to nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks.
                        
                           Specific Populations: Based on a population PK analysis using data from 909 patients, the clearance of nivolumab increased with increasing body weight supporting a weight-based dose. The population PK analysis suggested that the following factors had no clinically important effect on the clearance of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), gender, race, baseline LDH, PD-L1 expression, tumor type, tumor size, renal impairment, and mild hepatic impairment.
                        
                           Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the clearance of nivolumab was evaluated by a population PK analysis in patients with mild (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=313), moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=140), or severe (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=3) renal impairment. No clinically important differences in the clearance of nivolumab were found between patients with renal impairment and patients with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
                        
                           Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of nivolumab was evaluated by population PK analyses in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin [TB] less than or equal to the upper limit of normal [ULN] and AST greater than ULN or TB less than 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST; n=92). No clinically important differences in the clearance of nivolumab were found between patients with mild hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function. Nivolumab has not been studied in patients with moderate (TB greater than 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (TB greater than 3 times ULN and any AST) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].
