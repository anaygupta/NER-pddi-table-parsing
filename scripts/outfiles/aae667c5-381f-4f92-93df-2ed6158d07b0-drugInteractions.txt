                        Digoxin: Use FORTEO with caution in patients receiving digoxin. Transient hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity (5.8, 
                           7.1, 
                           12.3)

                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Digoxin

                     
                        A single FORTEO dose did not alter the effect of digoxin on the systolic time interval (from electrocardiographic Q-wave onset to aortic valve closure, a measure of digoxin's calcium-mediated cardiac effect). However, because FORTEO may transiently increase serum calcium, FORTEO should be used with caution in patients taking digoxin [see Warnings and Precaution (5.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Hydrochlorothiazide

                     
                        The coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg with teriparatide did not affect the serum calcium response to teriparatide 40 mcg. The effect of coadministration of a higher dose of hydrochlorothiazide with teriparatide on serum calcium levels has not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Furosemide

                     
                        Coadministration of intravenous furosemide (20 to 100 mg) with teriparatide 40 mcg in healthy people and patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (CrCl 13 to 72 mL/min) resulted in small increases in the serum calcium (2%) and 24-hour urine calcium (37%) responses to teriparatide that did not appear to be clinically important [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
