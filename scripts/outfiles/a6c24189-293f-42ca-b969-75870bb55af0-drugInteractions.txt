                        In a Phase I trial using escalating doses of paclitaxel
                                    (110 to 200 mg/m2) and cisplatin (50 or 75
                                        mg/m2) given as sequential infusions,
                                    myelosuppression was more profound when paclitaxel was given
                                    after cisplatin than with the alternate sequence (i.e.,
                                    paclitaxel before cisplatin). Pharmacokinetic data from these
                                    patients demonstrated a decrease in paclitaxel clearance of
                                    approximately 33% when paclitaxel was administered
                                    following cisplatin.
                        The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalyzed by
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Caution should be exercised when
paclitaxel is concomitantly administered with known substrates (eg, midazolam,
buspirone, felodipine, lovastatin, eletriptan, sildenafil, simvastatin, and
triazolam), inhibitors (eg, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir,
itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and
telithromycin), and inducers (eg, rifampin and carbamazepine) of CYP3A4.(see

                           ).
                              
                           
                        
                        Caution should also be exercised when paclitaxel
is concomitantly administered with known substrates (eg, repaglinide and
rosiglitazone), inhibitors (eg, gemfibrozil), and inducers (eg, rifampin) of
CYP2C8. (see 
                              
                                 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
                              
                           ).
                              
                           
                        
                        Potential interactions between paclitaxel, a substrate of
                                    CYP3A4, and protease inhibitors (ritonavir, saquinavir,
                                    indinavir, and nelfinavir), which are substrates and/or
                                    inhibitors of CYP3A4, have not been evaluated in clinical
                                    trials.
                        Reports in the literature suggest that plasma levels of
                                    doxorubicin (and its active metabolite doxorubicinol) may be
                                    increased when paclitaxel and doxorubicin are used in
                                    combination.
