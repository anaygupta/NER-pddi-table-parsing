                        Physical incompatibilities 
                        INFUVITE Pediatric (Multiple Vitamins for Infusion) is not physically compatible with alkaline solutions or moderately alkaline drugs such as acetazolamide, and chlorothiazide sodium, aminopylline or sodium bicarbonate. INFUVITE Pediatric is not physically compatible with ampicillin and it may not be physically compatible with tetracycline HCl. It has also been reported that folic acid is unstable in the presence of calcium salts such as calcium gluconate. Direct addition to intravenous fat emulsions is not recommended. Consult appropriate references for listings of physical compatibility of solutions and drugs with the vitamin infusion. In such circumstances, admixture or Y-site administration with vitamin solutions should be avoided. 
                        Some of the vitamins in INFUVITE Pediatric may react with vitamin K bisulfite or sodium bisulfite; if bisulfite solutions are necessary, patients should be monitored for Vitamin A, thiamine, and ascorbic acid deficiencies.
