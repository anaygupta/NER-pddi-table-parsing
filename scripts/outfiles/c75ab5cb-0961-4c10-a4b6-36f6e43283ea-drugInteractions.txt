               drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factorsynthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and altered physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditaryresistance). Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzymeinhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than onemechanism.The following factors, alone or in combination, may be responsible for INCREASED PT/INR response:Endogenous Factors: blood dyscrasias-see CONTRAINDICATIONS hepatic disorders: infectious hepatitis cancer jaundice collagen vascular disease hyperthyroidism congestive heart failure poor nutritional state diarrhea steatorrhea elevated temperature vitamin K deficiency Exogenous Factors:Potential drug interactions with warfarin sodium are listed below by drug class and by specific drugs.Classes of Drugs 5-lipoxygenase Inhibitor Antiplatelet Drugs/Effects Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist Adrenergic Stimulants, Central Antithyroid Drugs* Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Alcohol
