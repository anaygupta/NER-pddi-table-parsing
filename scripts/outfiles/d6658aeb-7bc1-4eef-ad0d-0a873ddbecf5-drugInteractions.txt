                     In vitro and animal metabolism studies showed that miltefosine did not markedly induce or inhibit the activity of the major human cytochrome P450 enzymes [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  The potential of miltefosine to interact with drug transporters has not been evaluated.  
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              •IMPAVIDO did not inhibit human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro.
                           
                              •IMPAVIDO did not induce cytochrome 3A activity in rats (7, 12.3).
