                        Bile acid sequestering agents, such as cholestyramine and colestipol, may interfere with the action of Chenodiol by reducing its absorption. Aluminum-based antacids have been shown to absorb bile acids in vitro and may be expected to interfere with Chenodiol in the same manner as the sequestering agents. Estrogen, oral contraceptive and collaborate (and perhaps other lipid-lowering drugs) increase biliary cholesterol secretion, and the incidence of cholesterol gallstones hence may counteract the effectiveness of Chenodiol.
                        Due to its hepatotoxicity, chenodiol can affect the pharmacodynamics of coumarin and its derivatives, causing unexpected prolongation of the prothrombin time and hemorrahages.  Patients on concommitant therapy with chenodiol and coumarin or its derivatives should be monitored carefully.  If prolongation of prothrombin time is observed, the coumarin dosage should be readjusted to give a prothrombin time 1Â½ to 2 times normal. If necessary chenodiol should be discontinued.
