Clinical Pharmacology
Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic originally
isolated from Streptomyces venezuelae.
It is primarily bacteriostatic and acts by inhibition of protein synthesis
by interfering with the transfer of activated amino acids from soluble RNA
to ribosomes. It has been noted that chloramphenicol is found in measurable
amounts in the aqueous humor following local application to the eye. Development
of resistance to chloramphenicol can be regarded as minimal for staphylococci
and many other species of bacteria.Streptomyces venezuelae.
