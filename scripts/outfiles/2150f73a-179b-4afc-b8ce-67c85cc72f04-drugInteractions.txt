                  Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4, and also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the multidrug efflux pump PgP. In vitro, everolimus is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a mixed inhibitor of CYP2D6.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Strong CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use. (2.2, 2.5, 5.9, 7.1)

                           
                           Moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors: If combination is required, use caution and reduce dose of AFINITOR. (2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 5.9, 7.1)

                           
                           Strong CYP3A4/PgP inducers: Avoid concomitant use. If combination cannot be avoided, increase dose of AFINITOR. (2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 5.9, 7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1     Agents That May Increase Everolimus Blood Concentrations
                     
                        
                           CYP3A4 Inhibitors and PgP Inhibitors 
                        
                        In healthy subjects, compared to AFINITOR treatment alone there were significant increases in everolimus exposure when AFINITOR was coadministered with:
                        
                           ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a PgP inhibitor) - Cmax and AUC increased by 3.9- and 15.0-fold, respectively.

                           
                           erythromycin (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a PgP inhibitor) - Cmax and AUC increased by 2.0- and 4.4-fold, respectively.

                           
                           verapamil (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a PgP inhibitor) - Cmax and AUC increased by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively.
                        
                        Concomitant strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/PgP should not be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
                        Use caution when AFINITOR is used in combination with moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors. If alternative treatment cannot be administered reduce the AFINITOR dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2     Agents That May Decrease Everolimus Blood Concentrations
                     
                        
                           CYP3A4/PgP Inducers
                        
                        In healthy subjects, co-administration of AFINITOR with rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and an inducer of PgP, decreased everolimus AUC and Cmax by 63% and 58% respectively, compared to everolimus treatment alone. Consider a dose increase of AFINITOR when co-administered with strong CYP3A4/PgP inducers if alternative treatment cannot be administered. St. John’s Wort may decrease everolimus exposure unpredictably and should be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3     Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by Everolimus
                     
                        Studies in healthy subjects indicate that there are no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions between AFINITOR and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) and pravastatin (a non-CYP3A4 substrate) and population pharmacokinetic analyses also detected no influence of simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) on the clearance of AFINITOR.
                        A study in healthy subjects demonstrated that co-administration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with everolimus resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam Cmax and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC(0-inf). 
                        Coadministration of everolimus and exemestane increased exemestane Cmin by 45% and C2h by 64%. However, the corresponding estradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different between the 2 treatment arms. No increase in adverse events related to exemestane was observed in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. 
                        Coadministration of everolimus and depot octreotide increased octreotide Cmin by approximately 50%.
