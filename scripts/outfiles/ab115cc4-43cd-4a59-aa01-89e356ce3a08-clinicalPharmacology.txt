                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Epirubicin hydrochloride is an anthracycline cytotoxic agent. Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of Epirubicin hydrochloride’s cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. 
                        Epirubicin hydrochloride forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. 
                        Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin hydrochloride also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin hydrochloride is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of Epirubicin hydrochloride is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. 
                        Epirubicin hydrochloride is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Epirubicin hydrochloride pharmacokinetics are linear over the dose range of 60 to 150 mg/m2 and plasma clearance is not affected by the duration of infusion or administration schedule. Pharmacokinetic parameters for Epirubicin hydrochloride following 6- to 10-minute, single-dose intravenous infusions of EPIRUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE at doses of 60 to 150 mg/m2 in patients with solid tumors are shown in Table 4. The plasma concentration declined in a triphasic manner with mean half-lives for the alpha, beta, and gamma phases of about 3 minutes, 2.5 hours, and 33 hours, respectively. 
                        


                        



                           Distribution
                        
                        Following intravenous administration, Epirubicin hydrochloride is rapidly and widely distributed into the tissues. Binding of Epirubicin hydrochloride to plasma proteins, predominantly albumin, is about 77% and is not affected by drug concentration. Epirubicin hydrochloride also appears to concentrate in red blood cells; whole blood concentrations are approximately twice those of plasma. 
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        Epirubicin hydrochloride is extensively and rapidly metabolized by the liver and is also metabolized by other organs and cells, including red blood cells. Four main metabolic routes have been identified: 
                        (1) reduction of the C-13 keto-group with the formation of the 13(S)-dihydro derivative, Epirubicin hydrochlorideol; (2) conjugation of both the unchanged drug and Epirubicin hydrochlorideol with glucuronic acid; (3) loss of the amino sugar moiety through a hydrolytic process with the formation of the doxorubicin and doxorubicinol aglycones; and (4) loss of the amino sugar moiety through a redox process with the formation of the 7-deoxy-doxorubicin aglycone and 7-deoxy-doxorubicinol aglycone. Epirubicin hydrochlorideol has in vitro cytotoxic activity one-tenth that of Epirubicin hydrochloride. As plasma levels of Epirubicin hydrochlorideol are lower than those of the unchanged drug, they are unlikely to reach in vivo concentrations sufficient for cytotoxicity. No significant activity or toxicity has been reported for the other metabolites. 
                        
                           Excretion
                        
                        Epirubicin hydrochloride and its major metabolites are eliminated through biliary excretion and, to a lesser extent, by urinary excretion. Mass-balance data from 1 patient found about 60% of the total radioactive dose in feces (34%) and urine (27%). These data are consistent with those from 3 patients with extrahepatic obstruction and percutaneous drainage, in whom approximately 35% and 20% of the administered dose were recovered as Epirubicin hydrochloride or its major metabolites in bile and urine, respectively, in the 4 days after treatment. 
                        
                           Effect of Age
                        
                        A population analysis of plasma data from 36 cancer patients (13 males and 23 females, 20 to 73 years) showed that age affects plasma clearance of Epirubicin hydrochloride in female patients. The predicted plasma clearance for a female patient of 70 years of age was about 35% lower than that for a female patient of 25 years of age. An insufficient number of males > 50 years of age were included in the study to draw conclusions about age-related alterations in clearance in males. Although a lower EPIRUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE starting dose does not appear necessary in elderly female patients, and was not used in clinical trials, particular care should be taken in monitoring toxicity when EPIRUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE is administered to female patients > 70 years of age [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 
                        
                        
                           Effect of Gender
                        
                        In patients ≤ 50 years of age, mean clearance values in adult male and female patients were similar. The clearance of Epirubicin hydrochloride is decreased in elderly women. 
                        
                           Effect of Race 
                        
                        The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of Epirubicin hydrochloride has not been evaluated. 
                        
                           Effect of Hepatic Impairment
                        
                        Epirubicin hydrochloride is eliminated by both hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion and clearance is reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction. In a study of the effect of hepatic dysfunction, patients with solid tumors were classified into 3 groups. Patients in Group 1 (n=22) had serum AST (SGOT) levels above the upper limit of normal (median: 93 IU/L) and normal serum bilirubin levels (median: 0.5 mg/dL) and were given EPIRUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE doses of 12.5 to 90 mg/m2. Patients in Group 2 had alterations in both serum AST (median: 175 IU/L) and bilirubin levels (median: 2.7 mg/dL) and were treated with an EPIRUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE dose of 25 mg/m2 (n=8). Their pharmacokinetics were compared to those of patients with normal serum AST and bilirubin values, who received EPIRUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE doses of 12.5 to 120 mg/m2. The median plasma clearance of Epirubicin hydrochloride was decreased compared to patients with normal hepatic function by about 30% in patients in Group 1 and by 50% in patients in Group 2. Patients with more severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 
                        
                        
                           Effect of Renal Impairment
                        
                        No significant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of Epirubicin hydrochloride or its major metabolite, Epirubicin hydrochlorideol, have been observed in patients with serum creatinine < 5 mg/dL. A 50% reduction in plasma clearance was reported in four patients with serum creatinine ≥ 5 mg/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Dosing and Administration (2.2)]. Patients on dialysis have not been studied. 
                        
                        
                           Effect of Paclitaxel
                        
                        The administration of paclitaxel (175-225 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion) immediately before or after Epirubicin hydrochloride (90 mg/m2 as bolus) caused variable increases in the systemic exposure (mean AUC) of Epirubicin hydrochloride ranging from 5% to 109%. At same doses of Epirubicin hydrochloride and paclitaxel, the mean AUC of the inactive metabolites of Epirubicin hydrochloride (Epirubicin hydrochlorideol and 7-deoxy-aglycone) increased by 120% and 70%, respectively, when paclitaxel was immediately administered after Epirubicin hydrochloride. Epirubicin hydrochloride had no effect on the exposure of paclitaxel whether it was administered before or after paclitaxel. 
                        
                           Effect of Docetaxel
                        
                        The administration of docetaxel (70 mg/m2 as 1-hour infusion) immediately before or after Epirubicin hydrochloride (90 mg/m2 as bolus) had no effect on the systemic exposure (mean AUC) of Epirubicin hydrochloride. However, the mean AUC of Epirubicin hydrochlorideol and 7-deoxy-aglycone increased by 22.5% and 95%, respectively, when docetaxel was immediately administered after Epirubicin hydrochloride compared to Epirubicin hydrochloride alone . Epirubicin hydrochloride had no effect on the exposure of docetaxel whether it was administered before or after docetaxel. 
                        
                        
                           Effect of Cimetidine
                        
                        Coadministration of cimetidine (400 mg twice daily for 7 days starting 5 days before chemotherapy) increased the mean AUC of Epirubicin hydrochloride (100 mg/m2) by 50% and decreased its plasma clearance by 30% 
                        
                           Drug metabolized by cutochrome P-450 enzymes
                        
                        No systematic in vitro or in vivo evaluation has been performed to examine the potential for inhibition or induction by Epirubicin hydrochloride of oxidative cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes.
