                        Drugs can interfere with the performance of skin tests in general, and specifically with histamine1.
                        Antihistamines: Response to histamine is suppressed by antihistamines.  The length of suppression varies, and is dependent on individual patient, type of antihistamine and length of time the patient has been on antihistamines.  The duration of this suppression may be as little as 24 hours (chlorpheniramine), and can be as long as 40 days (astemizole).
                        Tricyclic Antidepressants: These exert a potent and sustained decrease of skin reactivity to histamine, which may last for a few weeks.
                        Beta2 Agonists: Oral terbutaline and parenteral ephedrine, in general, have been shown to decrease allergen induced wheal. Theoretically, this may also reduce whealing capacity to histamine.
                        Dopamine: Intravenous infusion of dopamine has been shown to inhibit skin test responses to histamine.
                        Beta Blocking Agents: Propranolol can significantly increase skin test reactivity, including histamine.
                        Other Drugs: Short acting steroids, inhaled beta agonists, theophylline and cromolyn do not seem to affect skin test response.
