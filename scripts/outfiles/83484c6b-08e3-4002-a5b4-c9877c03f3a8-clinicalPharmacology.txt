                     12.3 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Dicyclomine relieves smooth muscle spasm of the gastrointestinal tract. Animal studies indicate that this action is achieved via a dual mechanism:
                            • a specific anticholinergic  effect (antimuscarinic) at  the acetylcholine-receptor sites with approximately 1/8 the milligram potency of atropine (in
                           vitro, guinea pig ileum); and
                            • a direct effect upon smooth muscle (musculotropic) as evidenced by dicyclomine's antagonism of bradykinin- and histamine-induced spasms ot the isolated guinea pig ileum.
                        Atropine did not affect responses to these two agonists. In vivo studies in cats and dogs showed dicyclomine to be equally potent against acetylcholine (ACh)-or barium chloride (BaCI2) induced intestinal spasm while atropine was at least 200 times more potent against effects of ACh than BaCI2. Tests for mydriatic effects in mice showed that dicyclomine was approximately 1/500 as potent as atropine; antisialagogue tests in rabbits showed dicyclomine to be 1/300 as potent as atropine.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.4 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Dicyclomine hydrochloride can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function

                           Absorption and Distribution
                        
                        In man, dicyclomine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak values within 60-90 minutes. Mean volume of distribution for a 20 mg oral dose is approximately 3.65 L/kg suggesting extensive distribution in tissues 
                        
                           Elimination
                        
                        The metabolism of dicyclomine was not studied the principal route of excretion is via the urine (79.5% of the dose). Excretion also occurs in the feces, but to a lesser extent (8.4%). Mean half-life of plasma elimination in one study was determined to be approximately 1.8 hours when plasma concentrations were measured for 9 hours after a single dose. In subsequent studies, plasma concentrations were followed for up to 24 hours after a single dose, showing a secondary phase of elimination with a somewhat longer half-life.
