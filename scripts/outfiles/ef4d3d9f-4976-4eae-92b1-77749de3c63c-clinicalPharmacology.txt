CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
In isolated nerve-muscle preparation, Dantrium has been shown to produce relaxation by affecting the contractile response of the muscle at a site beyond the myoneural junction.  In skeletal muscle, Dantrium dissociates the excitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the release of Ca++ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  The administration of intravenous Dantrium to human volunteers is associated with loss of grip strength and weakness in the legs, as well as subjective CNS complaints (see also PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients).  Information concerning the passage of Dantrium across the blood-brain barrier is not available.Dantrium has been shown to produce relaxation by affecting the contractile response of the muscle at a site beyond the myoneural junction.  In skeletal muscle, In the anesthetic-induced malignant hyperthermia syndrome, evidence points to an intrinsic abnormality of skeletal muscle tissue.  In affected humans, it has been postulated that “triggering agents” (e.g., general anesthetics and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents) produce a change within the cell which results in an elevated myoplasmic calcium.  This elevated myoplasmic calcium activates acute cellular catabolic processes that cascade to the malignant hyperthermia crisis.It is hypothesized that addition of Dantrium to the “triggered” malignant hyperthermic muscle cell reestablishes a normal level of ionized calcium in the myoplasm.  Inhibition of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by Dantrium reestablishes the myoplasmic calcium equilibrium, increasing the percentage of bound calcium.  In this way, physiologic, metabolic, and biochemical changes associated with the malignant hyperthermia crisis may be reversed or attenuated.  Experimental results in malignant hyperthermia susceptible swine show that prophylactic administration of intravenous or oral dantrolene prevents or attenuates the development of vital sign and blood gas changes characteristic of malignant hyperthermia in a dose related manner.  The efficacy of intravenous dantrolene in the treatment of human and porcine malignant hyperthermia crisis, when considered along with prophylactic experiments in malignant hyperthermia susceptible swine, lends support to prophylactic use of oral or intravenous dantrolene in malignant hyperthermia susceptible humans.  When prophylactic intravenous dantrolene is administered as directed, whole blood concentrations remain at a near steady state level for 3 or more hours after the infusion is completed.  Clinical experience has shown that early vital sign and/or blood gas changes characteristic of malignant hyperthermia may appear during or after anesthesia and surgery despite the prophylactic use of dantrolene and adherence to currently accepted patient management practices.  These signs are compatible with attenuated malignant hyperthermia and respond to the administration of additional i.v. dantrolene (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).  The administration of the recommended prophylactic dose of intravenous dantrolene to healthy volunteers was not associated with clinically significant cardiorespiratory changes.Dantrium to the “triggered” malignant hyperthermic muscle cell reestablishes a normal level of ionized calcium in the myoplasm.  Inhibition of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by Specific metabolic pathways for the degradation and elimination of Dantrium in humans have been established.  Dantrolene is found in measurable amounts in blood and urine.  Its major metabolites in body fluids are 5-hydroxy dantrolene and an acetylamino metabolite of dantrolene.  Another metabolite with an unknown structure appears related to the latter.  Dantrium may also undergo hydrolysis and subsequent oxidation forming nitrophenylfuroic acid.Dantrium in humans have been established.  Dantrolene is found in measurable amounts in blood and urine.  Its major metabolites in body fluids are 5-hydroxy dantrolene and an acetylamino metabolite of dantrolene.  Another metabolite with an unknown structure appears related to the latter.  The mean biologic half-life of Dantrium after intravenous administration is variable, between 4 to 8 hours under most experimental conditions.  Based on assays of whole blood and plasma, slightly greater amounts of dantrolene are associated with red blood cells than with the plasma fraction of blood.  Significant amounts of dantrolene are bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin, and this binding is readily reversible.Dantrium after intravenous administration is variable, between 4 to 8 hours under most experimental conditions.

This is twice the amount needed to maximally diminish twitch response to single supramaximal peripheral nerve stimulation (95% inhibition).  A transient, inconsistent, depressant effect on gastrointestinal smooth muscles has been observed at high doses.
