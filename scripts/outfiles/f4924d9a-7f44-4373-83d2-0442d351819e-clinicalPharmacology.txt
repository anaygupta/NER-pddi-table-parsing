                  Topical application of hydroquinone produces a reversible depigmentation of the skin by inhibition of the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) (Denton, C. et al., 1952)1 and suppression of other melanocyte metabolic processes (Jimbow, K. et al., 1974)2. Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light will cause repigmentation of the bleached areas (Parrish, J.A. et al., 1978)3.
