                        No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with AVONEX®.  In the placebo-controlled studies in multiple sclerosis, corticosteroids or ACTH were administered for treatment of exacerbations in some patients concurrently receiving AVONEX®.  In addition, some patients receiving AVONEX® were also treated with anti-depressant therapy and/or oral contraceptive therapy.  No unexpected adverse events were associated with these concomitant therapies.  However, the potential for hepatic injury should be considered when AVONEX® is used in combination with other products associated with hepatic injury, or when new agents are added to the regimen of patients already on AVONEX® (see WARNINGS: Hepatic Injury).
