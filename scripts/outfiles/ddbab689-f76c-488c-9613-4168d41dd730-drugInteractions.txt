                     7.1 Drug Interactions with Empagliflozin
                     
                        
                           Diuretics
                           
Coadministration
of empagliflozin with diuretics resulted in increased urine volume
and frequency of voids, which might enhance the potential for volume
depletion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
                        
                           Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues
                           
Coadministration of empagliflozin with insulin or insulin
secretagogues increases the risk for hypoglycemia [see Warnings
and Precautions (5.4)].
                        
                           Positive Urine Glucose
Test
                           
Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose
tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2
inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive
urine glucose tests.  Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic
control.
                        
                           Interference
with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay
                           
Monitoring
glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements
of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients
taking SGLT2 inhibitors.  Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic
control.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Drug Interactions with Linagliptin
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Inducers of P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 Enzymes
                              
                              Rifampin decreased linagliptin
exposure, suggesting that the efficacy of linagliptin may be reduced
when administered in combination with a strong P-gp or CYP3A4 inducer.
 Therefore, use of alternative treatments is strongly recommended
when linagliptin is to be administered with a strong P-gp or CYP3A4
inducer [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
