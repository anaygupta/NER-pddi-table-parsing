                        Ciprofloxacin is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterial agents [see Microbiology (12.4)].

                           Absorption
                           
                              Following 60-minute intravenous infusions of 200 mg and 400 mg CIPRO IV to normal volunteers, the mean maximum serum concentrations achieved were 2.1 and 4.6 mcg/mL, respectively; the concentrations at 12 hours were 0.1 and 0.2 mcg/mL, respectively (Table 9).
                              


                              


The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin are linear over the dose range of 200 mg to 400 mg administered intravenously. Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters following the 1st and 5th intravenous dose on an every 12 hour regimen indicates no evidence of drug accumulation.
                              The absolute bioavailability of oral ciprofloxacin is within a range of 70–80% with no substantial loss by first pass metabolism. An intravenous infusion of 400-mg ciprofloxacin given over 60 minutes every 12 hours has been shown to produce an area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) equivalent to that produced by a 500-mg oral dose given every 12 hours. An intravenous infusion of 400 mg ciprofloxacin given over 60 minutes every 8 hours has been shown to produce an AUC at steady-state equivalent to that produced by a 750-mg oral dose given every 12 hours. A 400-mg intravenous dose results in a Cmax similar to that observed with a 750-mg oral dose. An infusion of 200 mg CIPRO given every 12 hours produces an AUC equivalent to that produced by a 250-mg oral dose given every 12 hours (Table 10).
                              


                           



                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Distribution
                           
                              After intravenous administration, ciprofloxacin is widely distributed throughout the body. Tissue concentrations often exceed serum concentrations in both men and women, particularly in genital tissue including the prostate. Ciprofloxacin is present in active form in the saliva, nasal and bronchial secretions, mucosa of the sinuses, sputum, skin blister fluid, lymph, peritoneal fluid, bile, and prostatic secretions. Ciprofloxacin has also been detected in lung, skin, fat, muscle, cartilage, and bone. The drug diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, CSF concentrations are generally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations. Low levels of the drug have been detected in the aqueous and vitreous humors of the eye. 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Metabolism
                           
                              After intravenous administration, three metabolites of ciprofloxacin have been identified in human urine which together account for approximately 10% of the intravenous dose. The metabolites have antimicrobial activity, but are less active than unchanged. Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the co-administered drug [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.15) Drug Interactions (7)].
                              
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Excretion
                           
                              The serum elimination half-life is approximately 5–6 hours and the total clearance is around 35 L/hr. After intravenous administration, approximately 50% to 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Following a 200-mg intravenous dose, concentrations in the urine usually exceed 200 mcg/mL 0–2 hours after dosing and are generally greater than 15 mcg/mL 8–12 hours after dosing. Following a 400 mg intravenous dose, urine concentrations generally exceed 400 mcg/mL 0–2 hours after dosing and are usually greater than 30 mcg/mL 8–12 hours after dosing. The renal clearance is approximately 22 L/hr. The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually complete by 24 hours after dosing.
                              Although bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum concentrations after intravenous dosing, only a small amount of the administered dose (

A report of “Susceptible” indicates that the antimicrobial is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations at the site of infection necessary to inhibit growth of the pathogen. A report of “Intermediate” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of “Resistant” indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected.

For the diffusion technique using the ciprofloxacin 5 mcg disk the criteria in Table 12 should be achieved.
