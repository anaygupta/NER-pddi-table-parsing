                           Blood pressure lowering drugs (e.g., diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or vasodilators): Risk of hypotension (7.1)
                           When co-administered with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors the initial dose is 0.125 mg BID with 0.125 mg BID dose increments every 3 to 4 days.

                        Treprostinil inhibits platelet aggregation; there is increased risk of bleeding, particularly among patients receiving anticoagulants.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Effect of CYP2C8 Inhibitors
                     
                        Co-administration of Orenitram and the CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil in healthy adult volunteers increases exposure to treprostinil. Reduce the starting dose of Orenitram to 0.125 mg BID and use 0.125 mg BID increments every 3 to 4 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
