CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Edetate Disodium Injection, USP forms chelates with the cations
of calcium and many divalent and trivalent metals. Because of its affinity
for calcium, edetate disodium will produce a lowering of the serum calcium
level during intravenous infusion. Slow infusion over a protracted period
may cause mobilization of extracirculatory calcium stores. Edetate disodiumexerts a negative inotropic effect upon the heart.After
intravenous administration, the chelate formed is excreted in the urine with
50% appearing in 1 hour and over 95% in 24 hours.Edetate
disodium likewise forms chelates with other polyvalent metals and produces
increases in urinary excretion of magnesium, zinc and other trace elements.
It does not form a chelate with potassium but may reduce the serum level and
increase urinary loss of potassium.
