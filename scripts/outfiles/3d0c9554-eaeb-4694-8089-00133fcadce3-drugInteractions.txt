                           Carbamazepine: May need dose adjustment for APTIOM or carbamazepine. (2.3, 5.6, 7.2, 7.3)

                           Phenytoin: Higher dosage of APTIOM may be necessary and dose adjustment may be needed for phenytoin. (2.3, 7.2, 7.3)

                           Phenobarbital or Primidone:  Higher dosage of APTIOM may be necessary. (2.3, 7.2)

                           Hormonal Contraceptives:  APTIOM may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. (7.3, 7.4, 8.9)

                        Several AEDs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) can induce enzymes that metabolize APTIOM and can cause decreased plasma concentrations of eslicarbazepine (see Figure 1).

                        APTIOM can inhibit CYP2C19, which can cause increased plasma concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme (e.g., phenytoin, clobazam, and omeprazole). In vivo studies suggest that APTIOM can induce CYP3A4, decreasing plasma concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme (e.g., simvastatin) (see Figure 2).

                        The potential impact of other AEDs on the systemic exposure (area under the curve, AUC) of eslicarbazepine, the active metabolite of APTIOM, is shown in Figure 1:

                        The potential impact of APTIOM on the systemic exposure (AUC) of other drugs (including AEDs) is shown in Figures 2a and 2b:

                        Because concomitant use of APTIOM and ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel is associated with lower plasma levels of these hormones, females of reproductive potential should use additional or alternative non-hormonal birth control.
