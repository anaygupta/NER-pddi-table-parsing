                  Mechanism of Action
                  Fexofenadine hydrochloride, the major active metabolite of 
terfenadine, is an antihistamine with selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist activity. Fexofenadine hydrochloride 
inhibited antigen-induced bronchospasm in sensitized guinea pigs and histamine 
release from peritoneal mast cells in rats. In laboratory animals, no 
anticholinergic or alpha1-adrenergic-receptor blocking 
effects were observed. Moreover, no sedative or other central nervous system 
effects were observed. Radiolabeled tissue distribution studies in rats 
indicated that fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier.
                  Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is an orally active sympathomimetic amine and 
exerts a decongestant action on the nasal mucosa. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride 
is recognized as an effective agent for the relief of nasal congestion due to 
allergic rhinitis. Pseudoephedrine produces peripheral effects similar to those 
of ephedrine and central effects similar to, but less intense than, 
amphetamines. It has the potential for excitatory side effects. At the 
recommended oral dose, it has little or no pressor effect in normotensive 
adults.
