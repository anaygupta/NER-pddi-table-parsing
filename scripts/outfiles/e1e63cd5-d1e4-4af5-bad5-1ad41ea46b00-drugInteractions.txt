                     7.1	Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors
                     
                        BiDil is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), PDE5 inhibitors   such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Do not use BiDil in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator riociguat. Comcomitant use can cause hypotension [see Contraindications (4)].
