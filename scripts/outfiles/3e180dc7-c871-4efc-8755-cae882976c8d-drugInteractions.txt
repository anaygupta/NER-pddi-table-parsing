                        Using other agents known to affect cardiac conduction or contractility with diltiazem may increase the risk of bradycardia, AV block, and heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2Interactions with Cytochrome P-450 3A4 Substrates, Inhibitors and Inducers
                     
                        Diltiazem is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 3A4 enzyme system. 
                        
                           Simvastatin: Limit daily dose of simvastatin 10 mg and diltiazem to 240 mg, if co-administration of both drugs are required [see Drug Interactions (12.4)].
                        
                        
                           Rifampin: Avoid co-administration of rifampin with diltiazem [see Drug Interactions (12.4)].
