Drug Interactions
Although mivacurium chloride (a mixture of three stereoisomers) has been administered safely following succinylcholine-facilitated tracheal intubation, the interaction between mivacurium chloride and succinylcholine has not been systematically studied. Prior administration of succinylcholine can potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing agents. Evidence of spontaneous recovery from succinylcholine should be observed before the administration of mivacurium chloride.The use of mivacurium chloride before succinylcholine to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine has not been studied.There are no clinical data on the use of mivacurium chloride with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.Isoflurane and enflurane (administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC) decrease the ED50 of mivacurium by as much as 25% (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Individualization of Dosages). These agents may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement of mivacurium by as much as 35% to 40%. A greater potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effects of mivacurium may be expected with higher concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane. Halothane has little or no effect on the ED50, but may prolong the duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement by as much as 20%.50 of mivacurium by as much as 25% (see Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as mivacurium chloride include certain antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine. The neuromuscular blocking effect of mivacurium chloride may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase (see PRECAUTIONS: Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity subsection).PRECAUTIONS: Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity subsection).Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine. While the effects of chronic phenytoin or carbamazepine therapy on the action of mivacurium chloride are unknown, slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher.
