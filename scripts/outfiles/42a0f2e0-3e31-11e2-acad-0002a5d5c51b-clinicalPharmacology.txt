                  Peritoneal dialysis is the process of filtering excess water and toxins from the bloodstream through a semi-permeable membrane. This process does not cure the disease, but prevents progression of symptoms. Dialysis for chronic kidney failure is essential to maintain life, unless the patient receives a kidney transplant. A peritoneal dialysis procedure utilizes the peritoneum (lining of the abdomen) as the semi-permeable membrane. The procedure is conducted by instilling peritoneal dialysis solution through a catheter in the abdomen into the peritoneal cavity. 
							Since the peritoneum is heavily supplied with blood vessels, the contact of the solution with the peritoneum causes excess water and toxins in the bloodstream to be drawn across the membrane into the solution. This osmosis and diffusion occurs between the plasma of the patient and the peritoneal dialysis solution. After a period of time called "dwell time," the solution is then drained from the patient.
                  This solution does not contain potassium. In situations in which there is a normal serum potassium level or hypokalemia, the addition of potassium chloride (up to a concentration of 4 mEq/L) may be indicated to prevent severe hypokalemia. Addition of potassium chloride should be made after careful evaluation of serum and total body potassium and only under the direction of a physician.
                  
                  Clinical studies have demonstrated that the use of low magnesium solutions resulted in significant increases in serum CO2 and decreases in serum magnesium levels. The decrease in magnesium levels did not cause clinically significant hypomagnesemia.
