                  Following a single dose of two MINOCIN® 100 mg pellet-filled capsules administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 μg/mL (average 3.5 μg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours).
                  When MINOCIN® Pellet-Filled Capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of MINOCIN® Pellet-Filled Capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions.  The mean Tmax was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. MINOCIN®   Pellet-Filled Capsules may be administered with or without food.
                  In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines.
