                                    CYP 3A Inhibitors
                                    Tolvaptan is a substrate of CYP 3A. CYP 3A inhibitors can lead to a marked increase in tolvaptan concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Do not use SAMSCA with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A [see Contraindications (4.4)] and avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP 3A inhibitors.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    CYP 3A Inducers
                                    Avoid co-administration of CYP 3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's Wort) with SAMSCA, as this can lead to a reduction in the plasma concentration of tolvaptan and decreased effectiveness of SAMSCA treatment. If co-administered with CYP 3A inducers, the dose of SAMSCA may need to be increased [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
                                    
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    P-gp Inhibitors
                                    The dose of SAMSCA may have to be reduced when SAMSCA is co-administered with P-gp inhibitors, e.g., cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
