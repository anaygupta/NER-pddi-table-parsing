                  Carbinoxamine maleate is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative properties. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for receptor sites on effector cells.
                  The pharmacological effects of carbinoxamine maleate after oral absorption have been shown to last approximately 4 hours.
                  Interactions of carbinoxamine maleate with food or with other drugs and the possibility of cardiac conduction effects on the QT interval have not been studied.
