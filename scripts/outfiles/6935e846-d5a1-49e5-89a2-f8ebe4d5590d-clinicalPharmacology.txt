                        Enfuvirtide is an antiviral drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetic properties of enfuvirtide were evaluated in HIV-1 infected adult and pediatric subjects.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Absorption
                              
                              Following a 90-mg single subcutaneous injection of FUZEON into the abdomen in 12 HIV-1 infected subjects, the mean (±SD) Cmax was 4.59 ± 1.5 µg/mL, AUC was 55.8 ± 12.1 µg∙h/mL and the median Tmax was 8 hours (ranged from 3 to 12 h). The absolute bioavailability (using a 90-mg intravenous dose as a reference) was 84.3% ± 15.5%. Following 90-mg twice daily dosing of FUZEON subcutaneously in combination with other antiretroviral agents in 11 HIV-1 infected subjects, the mean (±SD) steady-state Cmax was 5.0 ± 1.7 µg/mL, Ctrough was 3.3 ± 1.6 µg/mL, AUC0-12h was 48.7 ± 19.1 µg∙h/mL, and the median Tmax was 4 hours (ranged from 4 to 8 h).
                              Absorption of the 90-mg dose was comparable when injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen, thigh or arm.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Distribution
                              
                              The mean (±SD) steady-state volume of distribution after intravenous administration of a 90-mg dose of FUZEON (N=12) was 5.5 ± 1.1 L.
                              Enfuvirtide is approximately 92% bound to plasma proteins in HIV-infected plasma over a concentration range of 2 to 10 µg/mL. It is bound predominantly to albumin and to a lower extent to α-1 acid glycoprotein.
                              The CSF levels of enfuvirtide (measured from 2 hours to 18 hours after administration of enfuvirtide) in 4 HIV-infected subjects were below the limit of quantification (0.025 µg/mL).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Metabolism/Elimination
                              
                              As a peptide, enfuvirtide is expected to undergo catabolism to its constituent amino acids, with subsequent recycling of the amino acids in the body pool.
                              Mass balance studies to determine elimination pathway(s) of enfuvirtide have not been performed in humans.
                              
                                 In vitro studies with human microsomes and hepatocytes indicate that enfuvirtide undergoes hydrolysis to form a deamidated metabolite at the C-terminal phenylalanine residue, M3. The hydrolysis reaction is not NADPH dependent. The M3 metabolite is detected in human plasma following administration of enfuvirtide, with an AUC ranging from 2.4% to 15% of the enfuvirtide AUC.
                              Following a 90-mg single subcutaneous dose of enfuvirtide (N=12) the mean ±SD elimination half-life of enfuvirtide is 3.8 ± 0.6 h and the mean ±SD apparent clearance was 24.8 ± 4.1 mL/h/kg. Following 90-mg twice daily dosing of FUZEON subcutaneously in combination with other antiretroviral agents in 11 HIV-1 infected subjects, the mean ±SD apparent clearance was 30.6 ± 10.6 mL/h/kg.

                                          Formal pharmacokinetic studies of enfuvirtide have not been conducted in subjects with hepatic impairment.
                                       
                                       
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                          
                                             Renal Impairment
                                          
                                          Analysis of plasma concentration data from subjects in clinical trials indicated that the clearance of enfuvirtide is not affected in patients with creatinine clearance greater than 35 mL/min.  The results of a renal impairment study indicate clearance of enfuvirtide was reduced by 38% in subjects with severe renal impairment (CL = 11 – 35 mL/min; n = 4) and by 14 - 28% in subjects with end-stage renal disease maintained on dialysis (n = 8) compared to subjects with normal renal function (CL >80 mL/min; n = 8).  Hemodialysis did not significantly alter enfuvirtide clearance.
                                          No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with impaired renal function.
                                       
                                       
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                          
                                             Gender and Weight
                                          
                                          Analysis of plasma concentration data from subjects in clinical trials indicated that the clearance of enfuvirtide is 20% lower in females than males after adjusting for body weight.
                                          Enfuvirtide clearance decreases with decreased body weight irrespective of gender. Relative to the clearance of a 70-kg male, a 40-kg male will have 20% lower clearance and a 110-kg male will have a 26% higher clearance. Relative to a 70-kg male, a 40-kg female will have a 36% lower clearance and a 110-kg female will have the same clearance.
                                          No dose adjustment is recommended for weight or gender.

                                          Analysis of plasma concentration data from subjects in clinical trials indicated that the clearance of enfuvirtide was not different in Blacks compared to Caucasians. Other pharmacokinetic studies suggest no difference between Asians and Caucasians after adjusting for body weight.

                                          The pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide have been studied in 23 pediatric subjects aged 6 through 16 years at a dose of 2 mg/kg. Enfuvirtide pharmacokinetics were determined in the presence of concomitant medications including antiretroviral agents. A dose of 2 mg/kg twice daily (maximum 90 mg twice daily) provided enfuvirtide plasma concentrations similar to those obtained in adult subjects receiving 90 mg twice daily.
                                          In the 23 pediatric subjects receiving the 2 mg/kg twice daily dose, the mean ±SD steady-state AUC was 56.3 ± 22.3 µg∙h/mL, Cmax was 6.3 ± 2.4 µg/mL, Ctrough was 3.1 ± 1.5 µg/mL, and apparent clearance was 40 ± 17 mL/h/kg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

                              Enfuvirtide interferes with the entry of HIV-1 into cells by inhibiting fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Enfuvirtide binds to the first heptad-repeat (HR1) in the gp41 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein and prevents the conformational changes required for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture
                              
                              The antiviral activity of enfuvirtide was assessed by infecting different CD4 cell types with laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1. The median EC50 value for baseline clinical isolates was 4.10 nM (ranged from 0.089 to 107 nM; 0.4 to 480 ng/mL) by the cMAGI assay (n=130) and was 55.9 nM (1.56 to 1675 nM; 7 to 7526 ng/mL) by a recombinant phenotypic entry assay (n=627). Enfuvirtide was similarly active in cell culture against clades A, AE, C, D, F, and G (median EC50 value was 7.01 nM; range 3.78 to 27.9 nM; 17-126 ng/mL), and R5, X4, and dual tropic viruses. Enfuvirtide has no activity against HIV-2.
                              Enfuvirtide exhibited additive to synergistic effects in cell culture assays when combined with individual members of various antiretroviral classes, including lamivudine, zidovudine, indinavir, nelfinavir, and efavirenz.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Drug Resistance
                              
                              HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to enfuvirtide have been selected in cell culture. Genotypic analysis of these resistant isolates showed mutations that resulted in amino acid substitutions at the enfuvirtide binding HR1 domain positions 36 to 38 of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41. Phenotypic analysis of site-directed mutants in positions 36 to 38 in an HIV-1 molecular clone showed a 5-fold to 684-fold decrease in susceptibility to enfuvirtide.
                              In clinical trials, HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to enfuvirtide have been recovered from subjects failing a FUZEON containing regimen. Posttreatment HIV-1 virus from 277 subjects experiencing protocol defined virological failure at 48 weeks exhibited a median decrease in susceptibility to enfuvirtide of 33.4-fold (range 0.4-6318-fold) relative to their respective baseline virus. Of these, 249 had decreases in susceptibility to enfuvirtide of greater than 4-fold and all but 3 of those 249 exhibited genotypic changes in the codons encoding gp41 HR1 domain amino acids 36 to 45. Substitutions in this region were observed with decreasing frequency at amino acid positions 38, 43, 36, 40, 42, and 45. Mutations or polymorphisms in other regions of the envelope (e.g., the HR2 region or those yet to be identified) as well as co-receptor usage and density may affect susceptibility to enfuvirtide.

                              HIV-1 clinical isolates resistant to nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and protease inhibitors (PI) were susceptible to enfuvirtide in cell culture.
