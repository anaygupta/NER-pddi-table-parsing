                     Otic Care Otic Solution combines the
properties of acetic acid, policosanol and aluminum acetate with the
analgesic action of antipyrine and the local anesthetic action of
benzocaine to relieve pressure, reduce inflammation and congestion, and
alleviate pain and discomfort in acute otitis media. Does not blanch
the tympanic membrane or mask the landmarks and therefore, does not
distort the otoscopic picture.
