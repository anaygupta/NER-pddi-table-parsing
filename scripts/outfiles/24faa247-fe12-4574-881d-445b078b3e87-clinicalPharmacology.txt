                  Cocaine blocks the initiation or conduction of the nerve impulse following local application, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.
                  Cocaine is absorbed from all sites of application, including mucous membranes and the gastrointestinal mucosa. Cocaine is degraded by plasma esterses, with the half-life in the plasma being approximately one hour.
