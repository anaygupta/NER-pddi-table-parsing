                        Atovaquone is highly bound to plasma protein (>99.9%). Therefore, caution should be used when administering Atovaquone concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur. The extent of plasma protein binding of atovaquone in human plasma is not affected by the presence of therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin (15Â mcg/mL), nor is the binding of phenytoin affected by the presence of atovaquone.

                              Coadministration of rifampin and Atovaquone Suspension results in a significant decrease in average steady-state plasma atovaquone concentrations (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions). Alternatives to rifampin should be considered during the course of PCP treatment with Atovaquone.
                              Rifabutin, another rifamycin, is structurally similar to rifampin and may possibly have some of the same drug interactions as rifampin. No interaction trials have been conducted with Atovaquone and rifabutin.
