                  None of the components of BSS PLUS solution are foreign to the eye, and BSS PLUS solution has no pharmacological action. Human perfused cornea studies have shown BSS PLUS solution to be an effective irrigation solution for providing corneal detumescence and maintaining corneal endothelial integrity during intraocular perfusion. An in vivo study in rabbits has shown the BSS PLUS solution is more suitable than normal saline or Balanced Salt Solution for intravitreal irrigation because BSS PLUS solution contains the appropriate bicarbonate, pH, and ionic composition necessary for the maintenance of normal retinal electrical activity. Human in vivo studies have demonstrated BSS PLUS solution to be safe and effective when used during surgical procedures such as pars plana vitrectomy, phacoemulsification, cataract extraction/lens aspiration, anterior segment reconstruction. No differences have been observed between adults and pediatric patients following use of this drug product.
