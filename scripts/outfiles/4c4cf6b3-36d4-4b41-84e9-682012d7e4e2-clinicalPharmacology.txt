                     12.1 Mechanism of Action

                     
                        Activation of beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3´, 5´-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP).  The increase in cyclic AMP is associated with the activation of protein kinase A, which in turn inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in muscle relaxation.  Levalbuterol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles.  Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway.  Levalbuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges.  While it is recognized that beta2-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there are beta-receptors in the human heart, 10% to 50% of which are beta2-adrenergic receptors.  The precise function of these receptors has not been established [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].  However, all beta-adrenergic agonist drugs can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes.

                                 Adults and Adolescents ≥12 Years Old
                              
                              In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 20 adults with mild-to-moderate asthma received single doses of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution (0.31 mg, 0.63 mg, and 1.25 mg) and racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution (2.5 mg).  All doses of active treatment produced a significantly greater degree of bronchodilation (as measured by percent change from pre-dose mean FEV1) than placebo, and there were no significant differences between any of the active treatment arms.  The bronchodilator responses to 1.25 mg of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution and 2.5 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution were clinically comparable over the 6-hour evaluation period, except for a slightly longer duration of action (>15% increase in FEV1 from baseline) after administration of 1.25 mg of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution.  Systemic beta-adrenergic adverse effects were observed with all active doses and were generally dose-related for (R)-albuterol.  XOPENEX Inhalation Solution at a dose of 1.25 mg produced a slightly higher rate of systemic beta-adrenergic adverse effects than the 2.5 mg dose of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution.

                              In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 12 adults with mild-to-moderate asthma were challenged with inhaled methacholine chloride 20 and 180 minutes following administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate, 1.25 mg of XOPENEX, 1.25 mg of (S)-albuterol, or placebo using a Pari LC Jet™ nebulizer.  Racemic albuterol sulfate, XOPENEX, and (S)-albuterol had a protective effect against methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction 20 minutes after administration, although the effect of (S)-albuterol was minimal.  At 180 minutes after administration, the bronchoprotective effect of 1.25 mg of XOPENEX was comparable to that of 2.5 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate.  At 180 minutes after administration, 1.25 mg of (S)-albuterol had no bronchoprotective effect.

                              In a clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate asthma, comparable efficacy (as measured by change from baseline FEV1) and safety (as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, serum potassium, and tremor) were demonstrated after a cumulative dose of 5 mg of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution (four consecutive doses of 1.25 mg administered every 30 minutes) and 10 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution (four consecutive doses of 2.5 mg administered every 30 minutes).

                                 Adults and Adolescents ≥12 Years Old
                              
                              The inhalation pharmacokinetics of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution were investigated in a randomized cross-over study in 30 healthy adults following administration of a single dose of 1.25 mg and a cumulative dose of 5 mg of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution and a single dose of 2.5 mg and a cumulative dose of 10 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution by nebulization using a PARI LC Jet™ nebulizer with a Dura-Neb® 2000 compressor.

                              Following administration of a single 1.25 mg dose of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution, exposure to (R)-albuterol (AUC of 3.3 ng•hr/mL) was approximately 2-fold higher than following administration of a single 2.5 mg dose of racemic albuterol inhalation solution (AUC of 1.7 ng•hr/mL) (see Table 5).  Following administration of a cumulative 5 mg dose of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution (1.25 mg given every 30 minutes for a total of four doses) or a cumulative 10 mg dose of racemic albuterol inhalation solution (2.5 mg given every 30 minutes for a total of four doses), Cmax and AUC of (R)-albuterol were comparable (see Table 5).

                              


                           



                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Children 6-11 Years Old
                              
                              The pharmacokinetic parameters of (R)- and (S)-albuterol in children with asthma were obtained using population pharmacokinetic analysis.  These data are presented in Table 6.  For comparison, adult data obtained by conventional pharmacokinetic analysis from a different study also are presented in Table 6.

                              In children, AUC and Cmax of (R)-albuterol following administration of 0.63 mg XOPENEX Inhalation Solution were comparable to those following administration of 1.25 mg racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution.

                              When the same dose of 0.63 mg of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution was given to children and adults, the predicted Cmax of (R)-albuterol in children was similar to that in adults (0.52 vs. 0.56 ng/mL), while predicted AUC in children (2.55 ng•hr/mL) was about 1.5-fold higher than that in adults (1.65 ng•hr/mL).  These data support lower doses for children 6-11 years old compared with the adult doses [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

                              Information available in the published literature suggests that the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of albuterol enantiomers in humans is SULT1A3 (sulfotransferase).  When racemic albuterol was administered either intravenously or via inhalation after oral charcoal administration, there was a 3- to 4-fold difference in the area under the concentration-time curves between the (R)- and (S)-albuterol enantiomers, with (S)-albuterol concentrations being consistently higher.  However, without charcoal pretreatment, after either oral or inhalation administration the differences were 8- to 24-fold, suggesting that (R)-albuterol is preferentially metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract, presumably by SULT1A3.

                              The primary route of elimination of albuterol enantiomers is through renal excretion (80% to 100%) of either the parent compound or the primary metabolite.  Less than 20% of the drug is detected in the feces.  Following intravenous administration of racemic albuterol, between 25% and 46% of the (R)-albuterol fraction of the dose was excreted as unchanged (R)-albuterol in the urine.

                                    The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution has not been evaluated.

                                    The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of racemic albuterol was evaluated in 5 subjects with creatinine clearance of 7 to 53 mL/min, and the results were compared with those from healthy volunteers.  Renal disease had no effect on the half-life, but there was a 67% decline in racemic albuterol clearance.  Caution should be used when administering high doses of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution  to patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
