                  12.1 Mechanism of Action

                  
                  
Simvastatin is a prodrug and is hydrolyzed to its activeform, simvastatin acid, after administration. Simvastatin is a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. In addition, simvastatin reduces VLDL and TG and increases HDL-C.

                  12.2 Pharmacodynamics

                  
                  
Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total-C, LDL-C, as well as decreased levels of HDL-C are associated with the development of atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk. Lowering LDL-C decreases this risk. However, the independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

                  12.3 Pharmacokinetics

                  
                  
Simvastatin is a lactone that is readily hydrolyzed in vivo to the correspondinga potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase is the basis for an assay in pharmacokinetic studies of themetabolites (active inhibitors) and, following base hydrolysis, active plus latent inhibitors (total inhibitors) in plasma following administration of simvastatin.

                  
Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled simvastatin in man, 13% of the dose was excreted in urine and 60% in feces. Plasma concentrations of total radioactivity (simvastatin plus 14C-metabolites) peaked at 4 hours and declined rapidly to about 10% of peak by 12 hours postdose. Since simvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction in the liver, the availability of the drug to the general circulation is low (<5%).

                  
Both simvastatin and itsmetabolite are highly bound (approximately 95%) to human plasma proteins. Rat studies indicate that when radiolabeled simvastatin was administered, simvastatinradioactivity crossed the blood-brain barrier.

                  
The major active metabolites of simvastatin present in human plasma are theof simvastatin and its 6'-hydroxy, 6'-hydroxymethyl, and 6'-exomethylene derivatives. Peak plasma concentrations of both active and total inhibitors were attained within 1.3 to 2.4 hours postdose. While the recommended therapeutic dose range is 5 to 80 mg/day, there was no substantial deviation from linearity of AUC of inhibitors in the general circulation with an increase in dose to as high as 120 mg. Relative to the fasting state, the plasma profile of inhibitors was not affected when simvastatin was administered immediately before an American Heart Association recommended low-fat meal.

                  
In a study including 16 elderly patients between 70 and 78 years of age who received simvastatin 40 mg/day, the mean plasma level of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity was increased approximately 45% compared with 18 patients between 18 to 30 years of age. Clinical study experience in the elderly (n=1522), suggests that there were no overall differences in safety between elderly and younger patients [seeUse in Specific Populations (8.5)].

                  
Kinetic studies with another statin, having a similar principal route of elimination, have suggested that for a given dose level higher systemic exposure may be achieved in patients with severe renal insufficiency (as measured by creatinine clearance).

                  
Although the mechanism is not fully understood, cyclosporine has been shown to increase the AUC of statins. The increase in AUC for simvastatin acid is presumably due, in part, to inhibition of CYP3A4.

                  
The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 can raise the plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity and increase the risk of myopathy [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)andDrug Interactions (7.1)].

Grapefruit juice was administered with breakfast for 3 days, and simvastatin was administered in the evening on Day 3.Because Chinese patients have an increased risk for myopathy with simvastatin coadministered with lipid-modifying doses (1 gram/day niacin) of niacin-containing products, and the risk is dose-related, Chinese patients should not receive simvastatin 80 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)andDrug Interactions (7.5)].Avoid taking with simvastatin [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)]Telithromycin200 mg QD for 4 days80 mgsimvastatin acidsimvastatin12 8.915 5.3Nelfinavir1250 mg BID for 14 days20 mg QD for 28 dayssimvastatin acidsimvastatin66.2Itraconazole200 mg QD for 4 days80 mgsimvastatin acidsimvastatin13.1 13.1Avoid >1 quart of grapefruit juice with simvastatin [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)]Grapefruit Juice(high dose)200 mL of double-strength TID60 mg single dosesimvastatin acid simvastatin7 16Grapefruit Juice(low dose)8 oz (about 237 mL) of single-strength#20 mg single dosesimvastatin acid simvastatin1.3 1.9Avoid taking with >10 mg simvastatin, based on clinical and/or post-marketing experience [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)]Gemfibrozil600 mg BID for 3 days40 mgsimvastatin acid simvastatin2.85 1.352.18 0.91Avoid taking with >20 mg simvastatin, based on clinical and/or post-marketing experience [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)]Verapamil SR240 mg QD Days 1 to 7 then 240 mg BID on Days 8 to 1080 mg on Day 10simvastatin acid simvastatin2.3 2.52.4 2.1Avoid taking with >40 mg simvastatin, based on clinical and/or post-marketing experience [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)]Diltiazem120 mg BID for 10 days80 mg on Day 10simvastatin acid simvastatin2.69 3.12.69 2.88Diltiazem120 mg BID for 14 days20 mg on Day 14simvastatin4.63.6No dosing adjustments required for the following:Fenofibrate160 mg QD x 14 days80 mg QD on Days 8 to 14simvastatin acid simvastatin0.64 0.890.89 0.83Niacin extended-release2 g single dose20 mg single dosesimvastatin acid simvastatin1.6 1.41.84 1.08Amlodipine10 mg QD x 10 days80 mg on Day 10simvastatin acid simvastatin1.58  1.771.56 1.47Propranolol80 mg single dose80 mg single dosetotal inhibitor     active inhibitor0.79     0.79from 33.6 to 21.1 ngfrom 7 to 4.7 ng
In a study of 12 healthy volunteers, simvastatin at the 80 mg dose had no effect on the metabolism of the probe cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates midazolam and erythromycin. This indicates that simvastatin is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and, therefore, is not expected to affect the plasma levels of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.

                  
Coadministration of simvastatin (40 mg QD for 10 days) resulted in an increase in the maximum mean levels of cardioactive digoxin (given as a single 0.4 mg dose on day 10) by approximately 0.3 ng/mL.
