                              •Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase guanfacine exposure. Decrease guanfacine to 50% of target dosage when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (2.7).
                           
                              •Strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease guanfacine exposure.Based on patient response, consider titrating guanfacine dosage up to double the target dosage over 1 to 2 weeks (2.7).
