                  No formal clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme-mediated drug interactions with trametinib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              •Avoid concurrent administration of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib. (7.1)
                           
                              •Avoid concurrent administration of strong inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib. (7.1)
                           
                              •Concomitant use with agents that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6 may result in loss of efficacy of these agents when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib. (7.1)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Dabrafenib
                     
                        Coadministration of MEKINIST 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily resulted in no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug interactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib for further details on the drug interaction potential of dabrafenib. Avoid concurrent administration of strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 with dabrafenib. If concomitant use of strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 is unavoidable, monitor patients closely for adverse reactions when taking strong inhibitors or loss of efficacy when taking strong inducers. Concomitant use of dabrafenib with agents that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6 may result in loss of efficacy of these agents. Substitute for these medications or monitor patients for loss of efficacy if use of these medications is unavoidable.
