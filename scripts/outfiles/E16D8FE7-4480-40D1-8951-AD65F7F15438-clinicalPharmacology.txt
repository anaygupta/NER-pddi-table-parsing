CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Sodium Iodide is readily absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Following absorption, the iodide is distributed primarily within the extracellular fluid of the body. It is concentrated and organically bound by the thyroid and concentrated by the stomach, choroid plexus, and salivary glands. It is also promptly excreted by the kidneys. The normal range of urinary excretion in 24 hours is reported to be 37-75% of the administered dose, varying with thyroid and renal function. The iodide concentrating mechanism of the thyroid, variously termed the iodide "trap" or "pump," accounts for an iodide concentration some 25 times that of the plasma level, but may increase to as much as 500 times under certain conditions."Trapped" iodide is oxidized to iodine and organically incorporated so rapidly that the trap contains less than 0.2% free iodide in comparison to organically bound iodine. This process results in a further concentration of iodine in the thyroid gland to about 500 fold that of blood. The iodinated organic compounds consist chiefly of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which are bound to thyroglobulin in the follicular colloid. The T4 and T3 are released by enzymatic proteolysis of thyroglobulin into the blood, where they are specifically bound and transported by plasma thyroid binding proteins. These reactions are mostly under the control of anterior-pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and hypothalamic thyroid releasing factor (TRF). Thyroid uptake is usually increased in hyperthyroidism and in goiter with impaired hormone synthesis. Uptake is usually decreased in hypothyroidism and normal or decreased in hyperthyroidism treated with iodide. It should be noted that the uptake of tracer iodine is a function of stable iodide concentration in the serum as well as of alterations in thyroid physiology.4) and triiodothyronine (T
