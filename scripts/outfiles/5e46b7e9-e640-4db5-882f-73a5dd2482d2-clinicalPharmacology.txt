                  PharmacodynamicsFlector® Patch applied to intact skin provides local analgesia by 
releasing diclofenac epolamine from the patch into the skin.  Diclofenac is a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  In pharmacologic studies, 
diclofenac has shown anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity.  As 
with other NSAIDs, its mode of action is not known; its ability to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis, however, may be involved in its anti-inflammatory 
activity, as well as contribute to its efficacy in relieving pain associated 
with inflammation.

                        Absorption
                     
                  
                  Following a single application of the Flector Patch on the upper inner arm, 
peak plasma concentrations of diclofenac (range 0.7 – 6 ng/mL) were noted 
between 10 – 20 hours of application.  Plasma concentrations of diclofenac in 
the range of 1.3 – 8.8 ng/mL were noted after five days with twice-a-day Flector 
Patch application.
                  Systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentrations of diclofenac, 
after repeated dosing for four days with Flector® Patch, were lower (less than 1%) 
than after a single oral 50 mg diclofenac sodium tablet.
                  The pharmacokinetics of Flector® Patch has been tested in healthy volunteers 
at rest or undergoing moderate exercise (cycling 20 min/h for 12 h at a mean HR 
of 100.3 bpm).  No clinically relevant differences in systemic absorption were 
observed, with peak plasma concentrations in the range of 2.2 – 8.1 ng/m while 
resting, and 2.7 – 7.2 ng/mL during exercise.
                  
                     
                        Distribution
                     
                  
                  Diclofenac has a very high affinity (greater than 99%) for human serum albumin.
                  
                     
                        Metabolism and Excretion
                     
                  
                  The plasma elimination half-life of diclofenac after application of Flector 
Patch is approximately 12 hours.  Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism 
and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate 
conjugates of the metabolites.
