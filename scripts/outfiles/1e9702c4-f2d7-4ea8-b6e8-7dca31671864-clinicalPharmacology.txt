                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level. 
                        The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.
                        Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. 
                        Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

                           Absorption
                           
                              Transdermal administration of Climara produces mean serum concentrations of estradiol comparable to those produced by premenopausal women in the early follicular phase of the ovulatory cycle. The pharmacokinetics of estradiol following application of the Climara transdermal system were investigated in 197 healthy postmenopausal women in six studies. In five of the studies, the Climara transdermal system was applied to the abdomen, and in a sixth study, application to the buttocks and abdomen were compared. 
                              The Climara transdermal delivery system continuously releases estradiol which is transported across intact skin leading to sustained circulating levels of estradiol during a 7-day treatment period. The systemic availability of estradiol after transdermal administration is about 20 times higher than that after oral administration. This difference is due to the absence of first pass metabolism when estradiol is given by the transdermal route.
                              In a bioavailability study, the Climara 6.5 cm2 was studied with the Climara 12.5 cm2 as reference. The mean estradiol levels in serum from the two sizes are shown in Figure 1.

                              Dose proportionality was demonstrated for the Climara 6.5 cm2 transdermal system as compared to the Climara 12.5 cm2 transdermal system in a 2-week crossover study with a 1-week washout period between the two-transdermal systems in 24 postmenopausal women. 
                              Dose proportionality was also demonstrated for the Climara transdermal system (12.5 cm2 and 25 cm2) in a 1-week study conducted in 54 postmenopausal women. The mean steady state levels (Cavg) of the estradiol during the application of Climara 25 cm2 and 12.5 cm2 on the abdomen were about 80 and 40 pg/mL, respectively. 
                              In a 3-week multiple application study in 24 postmenopausal women, the 25 cm2 Climara transdermal system produced average peak estradiol concentrations (Cmax) of approximately 100 pg/mL. Trough values at the end of each wear interval (Cmin) were approximately 35 pg/mL. Nearly identical serum curves were seen each week, indicating little or no accumulation of estradiol in the body. Serum estrone peak and trough levels were 60 and 40 pg/mL, respectively. 
                              In a single dose, randomized, crossover study conducted to compare the effect of site of application, 38 postmenopausal women wore a single Climara 25 cm2 transdermal system for 1 week on the abdomen and buttocks. The estradiol serum concentration profiles are shown in Figure 2. Values of Cmax and Cavg were, respectively, 25 percent and 17 percent higher with the buttock application than with the abdomen application.

The relative standard deviation of each pharmacokinetic parameter after application to the abdomen averaged 50 percent, which is indicative of the considerable intersubject variability associated with transdermal drug delivery. The relative standard deviation of each pharmacokinetic parameter after application to the buttock was lower than that after application to the abdomen (for example, for Cmax 39 percent versus 62 percent, and for Cavg 35 percent versus 48 percent).

                           Distribution 
                           
                              The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin. 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Metabolism
                           
                              Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.

                           Adhesion 
                           
                              An open-label study of adhesion potentials of placebo transdermal systems that correspond to the 6.5 cm2 and 12.5 cm2 sizes of Climara was conducted in 112 healthy women of 45 to 75 years of age. Each woman applied both transdermal systems weekly, on the upper outer abdomen, for 3 consecutive weeks. It should be noted that lower abdomen and upper quadrant of the buttock are the approved sites of application for Climara.
                              The adhesion assessment was done visually on Days 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 of each week of transdermal system wear. A total of 1,654 adhesion observations were conducted for 333 transdermal systems of each size. 
                              Of these observations, approximately 90 percent showed essentially no lift for both the 6.5 cm2 and 12.5 cm2 transdermal systems. Of the total number of transdermal systems applied, approximately 5 percent showed complete detachment for each size. Adhesion potentials of the 18.75 cm2 and 25 cm2 sizes of transdermal systems (0.075 mg per day and 0.1 mg per day) have not been studied.
