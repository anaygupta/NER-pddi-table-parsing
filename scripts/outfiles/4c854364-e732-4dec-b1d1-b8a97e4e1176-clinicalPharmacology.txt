                  Sodium fluoride acts systemically (before tooth eruption) and topically (post-eruption) by increasing tooth resistance to acid dissolution, by promoting remineralization, and by inhibiting the cariogenic microbial process. Xylitol is a five-carbon polyol that is noncariogenic and may reduce the risk of dental caries. Xylitol is a white, odorless, sweet tasting, crystalline powder.
