                        Androgens may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Dosage of the anticoagulant may require reduction in order to maintain satisfactory therapeutic hypoprothrombinemia.
                        Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.
                        In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and, therefore, insulin requirements.

                              Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxineÂ­binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.
