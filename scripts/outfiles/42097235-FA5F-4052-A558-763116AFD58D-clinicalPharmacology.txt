Mechanism of Action
Tizanidine is an agonist at α2-adrenergic receptor sites and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons.  In animal models, tizanidine has no direct effect on skeletal muscle fibers or the neuromuscular junction, and no major effect on monosynaptic spinal reflexes.  The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways.  The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons.2-adrenergic receptor sites and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons.

The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways.  The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons.The imidazoline chemical structure of tizanidine is related to that of the antihypertensive drug clonidine and other α2-adrenergic agonists.  Pharmacological studies in animals show similarities between the two compounds, but tizanidine was found to have one-tenth to one-fiftieth (1/50) of the potency of clonidine in lowering blood pressure.2-adrenergic agonists.

Pharmacokinetics
A single dose of two 4 mg tablets was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis.Following oral administration of the tablet (in the fasted state), tizanidine has peak plasma concentrations occurring 1.0 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours.When two 4 mg tablets are administered with food the mean maximal plasma concentration is increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration is increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes.Food also increases the extent of absorption of the tablets (See Figures 1 and 2).







Special Populations





Age Effects
No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects.  Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects.  Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children (see PRECAUTIONS).PRECAUTIONS).







Hepatic Impairment
Pharmacokinetic differences due to hepatic impairment have not been studied (see WARNINGS).WARNINGS).







Renal Impairment
Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect.  Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients (see PRECAUTIONS).PRECAUTIONS).







Gender Effects
No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects.  Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.







Race Effects
Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.







Drug Interactions - Oral Contraceptives
No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine.  Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS).PRECAUTIONS).
