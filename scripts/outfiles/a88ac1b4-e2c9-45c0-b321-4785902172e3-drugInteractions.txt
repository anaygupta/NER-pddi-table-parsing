                           Phenytoin

                           Although phenytoin dose adjustments are not routinely required, dose adjustment of phenytoin should be considered if clinically indicated, since SABRIL may cause a moderate reduction in total phenytoin plasma levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                        
                           Clonazepam

                           SABRIL may moderately increase the Cmax of clonazepam resulting in an increase of clonazepam-associated adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                           There are no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions between SABRIL and either phenobarbital or sodium valproate. Based on population pharmacokinetics, carbamazepine, clorazepate, primidone, and sodium valproate appear to have no effect on plasma concentrations of vigabatrin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                        SABRIL is unlikely to affect the efficacy of steroid oral contraceptives [see

                        SABRIL decreases alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) plasma activity in up to 90% of patients. In some patients, these enzymes become undetectable. The suppression of ALT and AST activity by SABRIL may preclude the use of these markers, especially ALT, to detect early hepatic injury. 
                        SABRIL may increase the amount of amino acids in the urine, possibly leading to a false positive test for certain rare genetic metabolic diseases (e.g., alpha aminoadipic aciduria).
