                                    other antimalarials, and with other antibiotics. However, the
                                    concomitant use of other antifolic drugs or agents associated
                                    with myelosuppression including sulfonamides or
                                    trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combinations, proguanil,
                                    zidovudine, or cytostatic agents (e.g., methotrexate), while the
                                    patient is receiving pyrimethamine, may increase the risk of
                                    bone marrow suppression. If signs of folate deficiency develop,
                                    pyrimethamine should be discontinued. Folinic acid (leucovorin)
                                    should be administered until normal hematopoiesis is restored
                                    (see WARNINGS). Mild hepatotoxicity has been reported in some
                                    patients when lorazepam and pyrimethamine were administered
                                    concomitantly.
