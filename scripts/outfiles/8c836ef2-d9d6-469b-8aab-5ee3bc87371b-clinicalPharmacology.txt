                  Gallium Citrate Ga 67, with no carrier added, has been found to concentrate in certain viable primary and metastatic tumors as well as focal sites of infection. The mechanism of concentration is unknown, but investigational studies have shown that Gallium Ga 67 accumulates in lysosomes and is bound to a soluble intracellular protein.
                  It has been reported in the scientific literature that following intravenous injection, the highest tissue concentration of Gallium Ga 67 - other than tumors and sites of infection - is the renal cortex. After the first day, the maximum concentration shifts to bone and lymph nodes and after the first week, to liver and spleen. Gallium Ga 67 is excreted relatively slowly from the body. The average whole body retention is 65 percent after seven days, with 26 percent having been excreted in the urine and 9 percent in the stools.
