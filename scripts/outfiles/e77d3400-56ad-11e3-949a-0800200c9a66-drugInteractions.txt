                     7.1 Anticoagulants, Antiplatelets, and Thrombolytics
                     
                        Co-administration of anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, and thrombolytics may increase the risk of bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with anticoagulants, aspirin, other platelet aggregation inhibitors, and/or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
                        
                        Long-term concomitant treatment with SAVAYSA and other anticoagulants is not recommended because of increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Short term co-administration may be needed for patients transitioning to or from SAVAYSA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
                        
                        In clinical studies with SAVAYSA concomitant use of aspirin (low dose â‰¤ 100 mg/day) or thienopyridines, and NSAIDs was permitted and resulted in increased rates of Clinically Relevant Bleeding.  Carefully monitor for bleeding in patients who require chronic treatment with low dose aspirin and/or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 P-gp Inducers
                     
                        Avoid the concomitant use of SAVAYSA with rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 P-gp Inhibitors
                     
                        Treatment of NVAF
                        Based on clinical experience from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, dose reduction in patients concomitantly receiving P-gp inhibitors resulted in edoxaban blood levels that were lower than in patients who were given the full dose.  Consequently, no dose reduction is recommended for concomitant P-gp inhibitor use [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].
