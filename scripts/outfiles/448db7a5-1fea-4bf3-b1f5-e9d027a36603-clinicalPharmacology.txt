                     12.1 Mechanism of Action

                     
                        The primary mode of action is thought to be through the osmotic effect of polyethylene glycol 3350 which causes water to be retained in the colon and produces a watery stool.

                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics

                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of PEG3350 following administration of PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution were not assessed. Available pharmacokinetic information for oral PEG3350 suggests that it is poorly absorbed.
