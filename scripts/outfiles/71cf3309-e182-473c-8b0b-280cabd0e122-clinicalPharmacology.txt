                        12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                     
                        Perampanel is a non-competitive antagonist of the ionotropic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor on post-synaptic neurons. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is implicated in a number of neurological disorders caused by neuronal over excitation.
                        The precise mechanism by which FYCOMPA exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans is unknown.

                           erformance
                           
In a healthy volunteer study to assess the effects of FYCOMPA on psychomotor performance using a standard battery of assessments including simulated driving, single and multiple daily doses of FYCOMPA 4 mg did not impair simple psychomotor tasks, driving performance, or sensorimotor coordination. Single and multiple doses of 8 mg and 12 mg impaired psychomotor performance in a dose-related manner. Car handling ability was impaired after dosing of FYCOMPA 12 mg, but postural stability was not significantly impaired. Performance testing returned to baseline within 2 weeks of cessation of FYCOMPA dosing. 
                        
                           Interactions with Alcohol
                           
In the above study (s
                           ee Psychomotor Performance), when administered to healthy subjects receiving alcohol to achieve a blood concentration of 80-100 mg/100 mL, FYCOMPA consistently impaired simple psychomotor performance after single doses of 4 to 12 mg, and after 21 days of multiple 12 mg/day doses. The effects of FYCOMPA on complex tasks such as driving ability were additive or supra-additive to the impairment effects of alcohol. FYCOMPA enhanced the effects of alcohol on vigilance and alertness, and increased levels of anger, confusion, and depression.
                        
                           Potential to Prolong QT Interval
                           
In a placebo-controlled thorough QT study of perampanel in healthy subjects, there was no evidence that perampanel caused QT interval prolongation of clinical significance at doses of 6 or 12 mg (i.e., the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted baseline-corrected QTc was below 10 msec). The exposures observed with the 12 mg dose in this study will not cover the exposures expected in patients with hepatic impairment taking doses over 6 mg/day. At the highest recommended dose (12 mg), perampanel did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

                        Pharmacokinetics
                     
                     
                        Pharmacokinetics of perampanel are similar in healthy subjects, patients with partial-onset seizures, and patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The half-life of perampanel is about 105 hours, so that steady state is reached in about 2-3 weeks. AUC of perampanel increased in a dose-proportional manner after single-dose administration of 0.2-12 mg and after multiple-dose administration of 1-12 mg once daily. 
                        
                           Absorption 
Perampanel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass metabolism. Median Tmax ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 hours under fasted condition. Food does not affect the extent of absorption (AUC), but slows the rate of absorption. Under fed conditions, Cmax of perampanel was decreased by 28-40% and Tmax was delayed by 2-3 hours compared to that under fasted conditions. 
                        
                           Distribution
                           
Data from in vitro studies indicate that, in the concentration range of 20 to 2000 ng/mL, perampanel is approximately 95-96% bound to plasma proteins, mainly bound to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. Blood to plasma ratio of perampanel is 0.55-0.59.
                        
                           Metabolism 
                           
Perampanel is extensively metabolized via primary oxidation and sequential glucuronidation. Oxidative metabolism is primarily mediated by CYP3A4/5 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2B6, based on results of in vitro studies using recombinant human CYPs and human liver microsomes. Other CYP enzymes may also be involved.
                        Following administration of radiolabeled perampanel, unchanged perampanel accounted for 74-80% of total radioactivity in systemic circulation, whereas only trace amounts of individual perampanel metabolites were detected in plasma. 
                        
                           Elimination
                           
Following administration of a radiolabeled perampanel dose to 8 healthy elderly subjects, 22% of administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 48% in the feces. In urine and feces, recovered radioactivity was primarily composed of a mixture of oxidative and conjugated metabolites. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled data from 19 Phase 1 studies reported that t1/2 of perampanel was 105 hours on average. Apparent clearance of perampanel in healthy subjects and patients was approximately 12 mL/min.

The pharmacokinetics of perampanel following a single 1 mg dose were evaluated in 12 subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B, respectively) compared with 12 demographically matched healthy subjects. The total (free and protein bound) exposure (AUC0-inf) of perampanel was 50% greater in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and more than doubled (2.55-fold) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared to their healthy controls. The AUC0-inf of free perampanel in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment was 1.8-fold and 3.3-fold, respectively, of those in matched healthy controls. The t1/2 was prolonged in subjects with mild impairment (306 vs. 125 hours) and moderate impairment (295 vs. 139 hours). Perampanel has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (

                           Renal Impairment
                           
A dedicated study has not been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of perampanel in patients with renal impairment. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on pooled data from patients with partial-onset seizures and receiving FYCOMPA up to 12 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Results showed that perampanel apparent clearance was decreased by 27% in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) compared to patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min), with a corresponding 37% increase in AUC. Considering the substantial overlap in the exposure between normal and mildly impaired patients, no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment. Perampanel has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment and patients undergoing hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (

In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures receiving FYCOMPA in placebo-controlled clinical trials, perampanel apparent clearance in females (0.54 L/hr) was 18% lower than in males (0.66 L/hr). No dosage adjustment is necessary based on sex.

FYCOMPA has not been studied in patients less than 12 years of age. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with partial-onset seizures receiving FYCOMPA in placebo-controlled trials, apparent clearance of perampanel was 0.729 L/hr, slightly higher than that in adults. Pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can be dosed similarly to adults.

In human liver microsomes, perampanel at a concentration of 30 μmol/L, about 10 fold the steady state Cmax at a 12 mg dose, had a weak inhibitory effect on CYP2C8, CYP3A4, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. Perampanel did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, UGT1A1, UGT1A4, and UGT1A6 up to a concentration of 30 µmol/L.
                        Compared with positive controls (including phenobarbital and rifampin), perampanel was found to weakly induce CYP2B6 (30 µmol/L) and CYP3A4/5 (≥3 µmol/L) in cultured human hepatocytes. Perampanel also induced UGT1A1 (≥3 µmol/L) and UGT1A4 (30 µmol/L). Perampanel did not induce CYP1A2 at concentrations up to 30 µmol/L.

                           Carbamazepine. As an inducer of CYP enzymes, carbamazepine increases perampanel clearance. Steady state administration of carbamazepine at 300 mg BID in healthy subjects reduced the Cmax and AUC0-inf  of a single 2 mg dose of perampanel by 26% and 67%, respectively. The t1/2 of perampanel was shortened from 56.8 hours to 25 hours. In clinical studies examining partial-onset and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that perampanel AUC was reduced by 64% in patients on carbamazepine compared to the AUC in patients not on enzyme-inducing AEDs [see Dos

                           Topiramate: Population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in clinical trials showed that perampanel AUC was reduced by approximately 19% in patients on topiramate compared to patients not on enzyme-inducing AEDs.
                        
                           Other AEDs: Population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in clinical trials showed that clobazam, clonazepam, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, valproate, and zonisamide did not have an effect on perampanel clearance.
                        Other strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John’s wort) may also greatly increase clearance of perampanel and reduce perampanel plasma concentrations [see Drug Interactions (
                           
                              7.2

FYCOMPA up to 12 mg/day did not significantly affect the clearance of clonazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, or zonisamide based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures in clinical trials. FYCOMPA had a statistically significant effect on the clearance of carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine, and valproic acid, but the increases in clearance of these drugs were each less than 10% at the highest perampanel dose evaluated (12 mg/day). FYCOMPA co-administration resulted in a 26% decrease in oxcarbazepine clearance and increased its concentrations. The concentrations of 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD), the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine, were not measured.

                           h of either ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel in healthy female subjects. In another study, a single dose of the oral contraceptive was administered following 21-day once daily dosing of FYCOMPA 12 mg or 8 mg in healthy females. FYCOMPA at 12 mg did not alter AUC0-24
                           h of ethinylestradiol but decreased its Cmax by 18%, and also decreased Cmax and AUC0-24h of levonorgestrel by 42% and 40%, respectively. FYCOMPA at 8 mg did not have significant effect on Cmax or AUC0-24
