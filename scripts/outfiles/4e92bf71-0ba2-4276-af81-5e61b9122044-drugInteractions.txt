                     Tamoxifen: Coadministration of Letrozole and tamoxifen 20 mg daily resulte in a reduction of Letrozole plasma levels by 38% on average. Clinical experience in the second-line breast cancer trials indicates that the therapeutic effect of Letrozole therapy is not impaired if Letrozole is administered immediately after tamoxifen. 
                  
                     Cimetidine: A pharmacokinetic interaction study with cimetidine showed no clinically significant effect on Letrozole pharmacokinetics. 
                  
                     Warfarin: An interaction study with warfarin showed no clinically significant effect of Letrozole on warfarin pharmacokinetics. 
                  
                     Other Anticancer Agents: There is no clinical experience to date on the use of Letrozole in combination with other anticancer agents.
