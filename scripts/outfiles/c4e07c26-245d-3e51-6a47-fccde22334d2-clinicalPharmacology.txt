                        Pharmacokinetics:
                      Absorption of metronidazole after topical application of MetroLotion® Topical Lotion is lass complete and more prolonged than after oral administration. Detectable plasma levels were found in all subjects following the administration of a 1 gram dose of MetroLotion® Topical Lotion (containing 7.5 mg of metronidazole) applied every morning and evening for 4 days to the faces of 8 patients. The highest concentration (96 ng/mL) seen following the morning dose on Day 5 was approximately 80 times lower than the peak concentrations produced by a single 250 mg tablet of metronidazole. The mean (± SD) AUC0-24 after twice daily administration was 962 ± 373 ng.hr/mL.
