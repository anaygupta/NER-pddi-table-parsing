                        Dibenzyline (phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride) may interact with compounds that stimulate both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors (i.e., epinephrine) to produce an exaggerated hypotensive response and tachycardia.(See WARNING.)
                        Dibenzyline blocks hyperthermia production by levarterenol, and blocks hypothermia production by reserpine.
