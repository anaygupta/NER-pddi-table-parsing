                  Propoxyphene is a centrally acting narcotic analgesic agent. Equimolar doses of propoxyphene hydrochloride or napsylate provide similar plasma concentrations. Following administration of 65, 130, or 195 mg of propoxyphene hydrochloride, the bioavailability of propoxyphene is equivalent to that of 100, 200, or 300 mg respectively of propoxyphene napsylate. Peak plasma concentrations of propoxyphene are reached in 2 to 2 Â½ hours. After a 100 mg oral dose of propoxyphene napsylate, peak plasma levels of 0.05 to 0.1 mcg/mL are achieved. As shown in Figure 1, the napsylate salt tends to be absorbed moreT slowly than the hydrochloride. At or near therapeutic doses, this absorption difference is small when compared with that among subjects and among doses.
                  Because of this several hundredfold difference in solubility, the absorption rate of very large doses of the napsylate salt is significantly lower than that of equimolar doses of the hydrochloride.
                  Repeated doses of propoxyphene at 6 hour intervals lead to increasing plasma concentrations, with a plateau after the ninth dose at 48 hours.
                  
                  
                     Figure 1. Mean plasma concentrations of propopxyphene in 8 human subjects following oral administration of 65 and 130 mg of the hydrochloride salt and 100 mg and 200 mg of the napsylate salt and in 7 given 195 mg of the hydrochloride and 300 mg of the napyslate salt.
                  Propoxyphene is metabolized in the liver to yield norpropoxyphene. Propoxyphene has a half-life of 6 to 12 hours, whereas that of norpropoxyphene is 30 to 36 hours.
                  Norpropoxyphene has substantially less central nervous system depressant effect than propoxyphene but a greater local anesthetic effect, which is similar to that of amitriptyline and antiarrhythmic agents such as lidocaine and quinidine.
                  In animal studies in which propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene were continuously infused in large amounts, intracardiac conduction time (PR and QRS intervals) was prolonged. Any intracardiac conduction delay attributable to high concentrations of norpropoxyphene may be of relatively long duration.
