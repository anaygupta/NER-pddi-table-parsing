                  METHENAMINE degrades in an acidic urine environment releasing
formaldehyde which provides bactericidal or bacteriostatic action. It
is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 70%-90% reaches the
urine unchanged at which point it is hydrolyzed if the urine is acidic.
Within 24 hours it is almost completely (90%) excreted; of this at a pH
of 5, approximately 20% is formaldehyde. Protein binding - some
formaldehyde is bound to substances in the urine and surrounding
tissues. Methenamine is freely distributed to body tissue and fluids
but is not clinically significant as it does not hydrolyze at pH
greater than 6.8.
                  SODIUM BIPHOSPHATE helps to maintain an acid pH in the urine necessary for the degradation of methenamine.
                  PHENYL SALICYLATE releases salicylate, a mild analgesic for pain.
                  METHYLENE BLUE possesses weak antiseptic properties. It is well
absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly reduced to
leukomethylene blue which is stabilizied in some combination form in
the urine. 75% is excreted unchanged.

                  
                  HYOSCYAMINE SULFATE is a parasympatholytic which relaxes smooth muscles and thus produces an antispasmodic effect. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly distributed throughout the body tissues. Most is excreted in the urine within 12 hours, 13% to 50% being unchanged. Its biotransformation is hepatic. Its protein binding is moderate.
