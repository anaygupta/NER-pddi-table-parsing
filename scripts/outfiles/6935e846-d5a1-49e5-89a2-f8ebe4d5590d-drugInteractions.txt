                           No dose adjustments of FUZEON or the co-administered drug is needed  when FUZEON is administered concomitantly with other antiretroviral or non-antiretroviral drugs.

                     7.1	Potential for FUZEON to Affect Other Drugs 
                     
                        Based on the results from an in vitro human microsomal study, enfuvirtide is not an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study (N=12), FUZEON at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily did not alter the metabolism of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19 or CYP2E1 substrates.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Enfuvirtide
                     
                        Based on the available data, co-administration of FUZEON and other drugs which are inducers or inhibitors of CYP450 is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide. No dose adjustments are needed when FUZEON is co-administered with other antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral drugs.
