Drug Interactions
Omeprazole can prolong the elimination of diazepam, warfarin and phenytoin, drugs that are metabolized by oxidation in the liver. There have been reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including omeprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Although in normal subjects no interaction with theophylline or propranolol was found, there have been clinical reports of interaction with other drugs metabolized via the cytochrome P-450 system (eg, cyclosporine, disulfiram, benzodiazepines). Patients should be monitored to determine if it is necessary to adjust the dosage of these drugs when taken concomitantly with ZEGERID.Because of its profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, it is theoretically possible that omeprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). In the clinical efficacy trials antacids were used concomitantly with the administration of omeprazole.Concomitant administration of omeprazole and atazanavir has been reported to reduce the plasma levels of atazanavir.Concomitant administration of omeprazole and tacrolimus may increase the serum levels of tacrolimus.Co-administration of omeprazole and clarithromycin have resulted in increases of plasma levels of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics).CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics).
