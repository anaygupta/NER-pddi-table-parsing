                     7.1 Coumarin and Coumarin Derivatives
                     
                        The soybean oil present in KABIVEN® has vitamin K1. Vitamin K1 can reverse the anticoagulant activity of coumarin and coumarin derivatives, including warfarin, which works by blocking recycling of vitamin K1. Monitor laboratory parameters for anticoagulant activity in patients who are on both KABIVEN® and coumarin or coumarin derivatives.
