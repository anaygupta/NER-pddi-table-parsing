                  Interactions between glatiramer acetate injection and other drugs have not been fully evaluated. Results from existing clinical trials do not suggest any significant interactions of glatiramer acetate injection with therapies commonly used in MS patients, including the concurrent use of corticosteroids for up to 28 days. Glatiramer acetate injection has not been formally evaluated in combination with interferon beta.
