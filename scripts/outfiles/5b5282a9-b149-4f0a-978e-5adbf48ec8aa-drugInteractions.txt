(7.1)
                           Drugs that potentiate the pressor effects of epinephrine include sympathomimetics, beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors, COMT 

inhibitors, clonidine, doxapram, and oxytocin. (7.2)
                           Drugs that increase the arrhythmogenic potential of epinephrine include beta blockers, cyclopropane and halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics, 

antihistamines, exogenous thyroid hormones, diuretics, and digitalis glycosides. (7.2)
                           Potassium-depleting drugs, including corticosteroids, diuretics, and theophylline, potentiate the hypokalemic effects of epinephrine.

antihypertensive effect and requiring increased dosage of the latter.
