                  Morphine is a potent narcotic analgesic; it's principal therapeutic effect is relief of pain. In addition to analgesia, narcotics produce drowsiness, changes in mood, and mental clouding; although neither sensory modalities nor motor activity are blocked at therapeutic doses. There is no intrinsic limit to the analgesic effect. Clinically, however, dosage limitations are imposed by the adverse effects, primarily respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting, which can result from high doses.
                  Morphine has diverse additional actions. It depresses the respiratory center, stimulates the vomiting center, depresses the cough reflex, constricts the pupils, increases the tone of gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, and produces mild vasodilation. Morphine is detoxified in the liver by means of conjugation with glucuronic acid. Small amounts of the free drug and larger amounts of conjugated morphine are present in the urine, and these account for most of the administered drug. Ninety percent of the total excretion occurs within the first 24 hours.
                  Morphine is about two-thirds absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with the maximum analgesic effect occuring 20-60 minutes post administration.
