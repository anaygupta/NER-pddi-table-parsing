- CYP P450 2D6 enzyme inhibitors may increase and rifampin may decrease carvedilol levels. (7.1, 7.5) 
- Hypotensive agents (e.g., reserpine, MAO inhibitors, clonidine) may increase the risk of hypotension and/or severe bradycardia. (7.2) 
- Cyclosporine or digoxin levels may increase. (7.3, 7.4) 
- Both digitalis glycosides and β-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. (7.4) 
- Amiodarone may increase carvedilol levels resulting in further slowing of the heart rate or cardiac conduction. (7.6) 
- Verapamil or diltiazem-type calcium channel blockers may affect ECG and/or blood pressure. (7.7) 
- Insulin and oral hypoglycemics action may be enhanced. (7.8)
