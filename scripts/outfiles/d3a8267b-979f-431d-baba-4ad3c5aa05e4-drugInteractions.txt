                           Valproate increases lamotrigine concentrations more than 2-fold. (7, 12.3) 
                           Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 40%. (7, 12.3) 
                           Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and rifampin also decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 50%. (7, 12.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        Significant drug interactions with lamotrigine are summarized in Table 4. Additional details of these drug interaction studies, which were conducted using immediate-release lamotrigine, are provided in the Clinical Pharmacology section [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
