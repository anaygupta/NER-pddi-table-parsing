                  Iodine is an integral part of thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).  The hormones regulate basal metabolism.  The thyroid function is modulated by hypothalmicpituitary axis through thyroid-releasing hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone by negative feed back of thyroxine levels in plasma.  The essentiality of iodine in humans and animals is well established.  Persistent iodine deficiency results in histological changes in thyroid gland and impaired thyroid function, which may culminate in goiter.  Iodine deficiency in early stage in life has been reported to produce cretinism.  Published reports on pharmacokinetics of iodine in humans and animals show that absorption of iodine from the gastrointestinal tract is rapid and complete.
                  Skin and lungs can also absorb iodine.  Iodine is utilized as iodide or iodated organic complexes.  On administration iodide equilibrates in extracellular fluids and although all body cells contain iodide, it is specifically concentrated by thyroid gland, which, in humans, is estimated to contain 7 to 8 mg total iodine.
                  

                  Other important organs to take up iodide are salivary glands and gastric mucosa, and to a lesser extent, choroid plexus, skin, hair, mammary glands and placenta. Iodine in saliva and gastric mucosal secretions is reabsorbed and recycled.  The circulating iodine is hormonal thyroxine of which 30 to 70 mcg is protein bound and 0.5 mcg is free thyroxine.  The normal plasma inorganic iodide levels are estimated between 0.5 and 1.5 mcg/100 mL.  The major route of excretion is via kidneys.  Some excretion of conjugated thyroid hormones takes place via bile.
