                  PrasteraÂ® softgels are an oral dosage form of pharmaceutical-grade prasterone, chemically identical to prasterone of native human origin, in a lipophilic vehicle.

               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.1 Pharmacodynamics

                     
                        Oral prasterone has been shown to increase serum levels of 5-DHEAS.  The precise mechanism by which normal serum levels of 5-DHEAS may act to reduce the risk of auto-immune flare, breast cancer and death is not known.

                           12.2.1 Time To Peak Concentration

                           
                              Oral prasterone reaches a peak serum concentration at 1.5 to 2 hours after administration. In healthy young women (mean age, 30 years) receiving prasterone 200 mg daily (given with prednisone), mean peak plasma levels on day 29 of prasterone and 5-DHEAS were 1.3 mcg/dL (13 ng/mL) and 942 mcg/dL (9.4 mcg/mL), and occurred in 2 hours and 2.4 hours, respectively, after administration. In elderly women (mean, 69 years) and elderly men (mean, 69 years), mean peak plasma concentrations (times to peak levels) after a single 200-mg micronized oral dose were 27 ng/mL (1.4 hours) and 22 ng/mL (1.3 hours), respectively. After a single 200 mg dose, mean serum levels of 5-DHEAS increased 5-fold in men (to 7 mcg/mL) and 21-fold in women (to 7.5 mcg/mL) relative to baseline healthy levels.

                              During two weeks of daily administration (200 mg), plasma levels (and times to peak levels) of both 5-dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfated metabolite did not change significantly in either women or men, indicating a lack of accumulation.

                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           12.2.3 Distribution

                           
                              Approximately 10% to 20% of prasterone is bound to serum protein; approximately 80% to 90% of 5-DHEAS is bound to protein. 5-DHEAS penetrates the blood-brain barrier; cerebro-spinal fluid levels of 5-DHEAS range from 0.2% to 5% of corresponding plasma levels.

                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           12.2.4 Metabolism

                           
                              Oral prasterone is sulfated to 5-DHEAS ester in the intestine and liver by sulfotransferases. Prasterone and 5-DHEAS are converted in peripheral tissues to androstenedione, androsterone sulfate, estradiol, estriol and estrone, dihydrotestosterone, 7-oxo-prasterone, and testosterone.

                              Prasterone (200mg dose) elimination half-life: young women, 11 hours; elderly men, 7 hours.  In elderly women, the elimination half-life progressively declined, from about 12 hours (day 1), to 9 hours (day 8), to 7 hours (day 15). 5-DHEAS half-life: young women, 12 hours; elderly men, 20-25 hours; elderly women, 24-27 hours.

                              The pharmacokinetics of oral prasterone has not been assessed in low body weight or obese patients.  There is insufficient information available from placebo-controlled clinical trials to compare prasterone pharmacokinetics in different racial groups, nor for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
