                  Cyclopentolate hydrochloride is an anticholinergic drug and Phenylephrine hydrochloride is an adrenergic drug. This combination induces mydriasis that is greater than that of either drug alone at its respective concentration. The concentrations of cyclopentolate hydrochloride and phenylephrine hydrochloride have been selected to induce mydriasis with little accompanying cycloplegia. Heavily pigmented irides may require more doses than lightly pigmented irides.
