                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        CRESTOR is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol.  In vivo studies in animals, and in vitro studies in cultured animal and human cells have shown rosuvastatin to have a high uptake into, and selectivity for, action in the liver, the target organ for cholesterol lowering.  In in vivo and in vitro studies, rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways.  First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell-surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL.  Second, rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.

                                 Absorption:
                               In clinical pharmacology studies in man, peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing. Both Cmax  and AUC increased in approximate proportion to CRESTOR dose. The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20%. 
                           
                               Administration of CRESTOR with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin.   
                           
                               The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration.

                                 Distribution:
                               Mean volume of distribution at steady-state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters. Rosuvastatin is 88% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations.

                                 Metabolism:
                               Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized; approximately 10% of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite. The major metabolite is N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is formed principally by cytochrome P450  2C9, and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N-desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one-sixth to one-half the HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound. Overall, greater than 90% of active plasma HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound.

                                 Excretion:
                               Following oral administration, rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces (90%). The elimination half-life (t1/2) of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours. 
                           
                               After an intravenous dose, approximately 28% of total body clearance was via the renal route, and 72% by the hepatic route.

                               A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics among Caucasian, Hispanic, and Black or Afro-Caribbean groups. However, pharmacokinetic studies, including one conducted in the US, have demonstrated an approximate 2‑fold elevation in median exposure (AUC and Cmax) in Asian subjects when compared with a Caucasian control group.

                               Mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) had no influence on plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. However, plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin increased to a clinically significant extent (about 3‑fold) in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) not receiving hemodialysis compared with healthy subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min/1.73 m2).

                               In patients with Child‑Pugh A disease, Cmax and AUC were increased by 60% and 5%, respectively, as compared with patients with normal liver function. In patients with Child‑Pugh B disease, Cmax and AUC were increased 100% and 21%, respectively, compared with patients with normal liver function.

                        Rosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent.
                        Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins including the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion-transporting polyprotein 1B1 (OATP1B1) and efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein  (BCRP).  Concomitant administration of CRESTOR with medications that are inhibitors of these transporter proteins (e.g. cyclosporine, certain HIV protease inhibitors) may result in increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations and an increased risk of myopathy [see 
                              Dosage and Administration (2.5)
                           ].
