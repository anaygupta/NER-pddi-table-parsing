  18F]FDG, a radiolabeled analog of glucose, rapidly distributes, after intravenous injection, to all organs of the body. After background clearance, peak imaging is at 30 - 40 minutes after injection.

                        In 4 normal male volunteers, after an intravenous dose given over 30 seconds, the arterial blood level profile for [
  18F]FDG can be described by a triexponential decay curve. The half-lives for the different distribution and elimination phases are 0.2-0.3 min, 10-13 min (mean ± s.d.; 11.6 ± 1.1 min), and 80-95 min (88 ± 4 min).
 
                        
                        
                        Within 33 minutes, a mean of 3.9% of the injected dose can be measured in the urine. Bladder activity two hours after injection indicates that a mean of 20.6% of the injected dose is present. See the Metabolism Section for additional clearance times.

  18F]FDG is taken up by cells and phosphorylated to [
  18F]FDG-6-phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within a given tissue. [
  18F]FDG-6-phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2- deoxy-2-[
  18F]fluoro-6-phospho-D-mannose ([
  18F]FDM-6-phosphate).

  18F]FDG may contain 2-deoxy-2-chloro-D-glucose (C1DG) as an impurity. Distribution and metabolism of C1DG are presumably similar to that of [
  18F]FDG, and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-g14icose (C1DG-6-phosphate) and 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6- phospho-D-mannose (CIDM-6-phosphate). The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated, and the resulting compounds, (FDG, FDM, C1DG and C1DM) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion.

  18F]FDG is a glucose analogue which concentrates in cells that rely upon glucose as a primary energy source. Once in the cell it is phosphorylated and can not exit until dephosphorylation has occurred. Regions of “increased [
  18F]FDG uptake" correlate with increased glucose metabolism. Regions of decreased/absent uptake reflect the absence of glucose metabolism. Background activity reflects uptake by normal cells. [
  18F]FDG uptake in inflammatory cells is inconsistent and may be increased, normal or decreased. Whether or not [
  18F]FDG, CIDG, or their metabolites can inhibit glucose metabolism is not known.
