 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Herpes simplex virus utilizes thymidine in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a metabolite necessary for reproduction.  Idoxuridine is identical in chemical structure to thymidine except that the 5-methyl group is replaced by iodine.  When idoxuridine is substituted for thymidine in DNA, the cell is unable to utilize the DNA and reproduction ceases.Herpes simplex virus utilizes thymidine in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a metabolite necessary for reproduction.
