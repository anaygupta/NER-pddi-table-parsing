Mechanism of Action 
Sentra PM acts by restoring and maintaining the balance of the neurotransmitters, serotonin and acetylcholine, that are associated with sleep disorders. 

                     
Metabolism 
The amino acids in Sentra PM are primarily absorbed by the stomach and small intestines. All cells metabolize the amino acids in Sentra PM. Circulating tryptophan and choline blood levels determine the production of serotonin and acetylcholine. 

                     
Excretion 
Sentra PM is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4. These isoenzymes are principally responsible for 95% of all detoxification of drugs, with CYP3A4 being responsible for detoxification of roughly 50% of drugs. Amino acids do not appear to have an effect on drug metabolizing enzymes.
