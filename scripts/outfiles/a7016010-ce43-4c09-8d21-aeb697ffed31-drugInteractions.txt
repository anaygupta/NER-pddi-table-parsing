                  The potential of luliconazole to inhibit cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 was evaluated  in vitro. Based on  in vitro assessment, luliconazole at therapeutic doses, particularly when applied to patients with moderate to severe tinea cruris, may inhibit the activity of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. However, no  in vivo drug interaction trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of luliconazole on other drugs that are substrates of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.
                  Luliconazole is not expected to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2C9 and 2D6 based on  in vitro assessment. The induction potential of luliconazole on CYP enzymes has not been evaluated.
