                                          The following drugs may potentiate the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin when used concurrently:  carbamazepine; chlorpropamide; clofibrate; urea; fludrocortisone; tricyclic antidepressants. 
                                          The following drugs may decrease the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin when used concurrently:  demeclocycline; norepinephrine; lithium; heparin; alcohol.
                                          Ganglionic blocking agents may produce a marked increase in sensitivity to the pressor effects of vasopressin.

                                                Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with vasopressin. It is also not known whether vasopressin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Vasopressin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

                                                      Doses of vasopressin sufficient for an antidiuretic effect are not likely to produce tonic uterine contractions that could be deleterious to the fetus or threaten the continuation of the pregnancy.

                                                            Caution should be exercised when vasopressin is administered to a nursing woman.
