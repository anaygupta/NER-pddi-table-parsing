                           Drugs that increase risks due to fluid and electrolyte changes (7.1)

                           Oral medication taken within 1 hour of each dose may not be absorbed properly (7.2).

                           Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives may increase the risk of ischemic colitis (7.3).

                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Drugs That May Increase Risks Due to Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities

                     
                        Certain medical conditions and concomitant medications may increase the risk for developing fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities when taking Suclear.  This includes patients receiving drugs which may be associated with hypokalemia (such as diuretics or corticosteroids, or drugs where hypokalemia is a particular risk, such as cardiac glycosides) or hyponatremia. Use caution when Suclear is used in patients on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) or drugs known to induce Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, antipsychotic drugs and carbamazepine, as these drugs may increase the risk of water retention and/or electrolyte imbalance. Consider additional patient evaluations as appropriate [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Potential for Altered Drug Absorption

                     
                        Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of each Suclear dose may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the medication may not be absorbed properly.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Stimulant Laxatives

                     
                        Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and Suclear may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid use of stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate) while taking Suclear.
