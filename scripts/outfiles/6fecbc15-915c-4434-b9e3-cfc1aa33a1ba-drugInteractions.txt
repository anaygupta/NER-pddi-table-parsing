                           Tizanidine
                           
                              In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic exposure of tizanidine (4 mg single dose) was significantly increased (Cmax 7 fold, AUC 10 fold) when the drug was given concomitantly with ciprofloxacin (500 mg BID for 3 days). The hypotensive and sedative effects of tizanidine were also potentiated. Concomitant administration of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin is contraindicated (see 
                                    CONTRAINDICATIONS
                                 ).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Theophylline
                           
                              As with some other quinolones, concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin with theophylline may lead to elevated serum concentrations of theophylline and prolongation of its elimination half-life. This may result in increased risk of theophylline-related adverse reactions (see 
                                    WARNINGS
                                 ). If concomitant use cannot be avoided, serum levels of theophylline should be monitored and dosage adjustments made as appropriate.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Other Xanthine Derivatives
                           
                              Some quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine. This may lead to reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life. On concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin and caffeine or pentoxifylline containing products, elevated serum concentrations of these xanthine derivatives were reported.

                              Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium/aluminum antacids, polymeric phosphate binders (for example, sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate) sucralfate, VidexÂ® (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, other highly buffered drugs, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease its absorption, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired (see

                              Histamine H2-receptor antagonists appear to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Omeprazole
                           
                              Concomitant administration of a single tablet dose of 500 mg ciprofloxacin and once-daily administration of 20 mg omeprazole pretreatment for 4 days resulted in a 16% reduction of mean Cmax and mean AUC of ciprofloxacin.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Phenytoin
                           
                              Altered serum levels of phenytoin (increased and decreased) have been reported in patients receiving concomitant ciprofloxacin. To avoid the loss of seizure control associated with decreased phenytoin levels, and to prevent phenytoin overdose-related undesirable effects when ciprofloxacin is discontinued in patients receiving both agents, monitoring of phenytoin therapy, including phenytoin serum concentration measurements, is recommended during and shortly after coadministration of ciprofloxacin with phenytoin.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Oral Antidiabetic Agents 
                           
                              Hypoglycemia has been reported when ciprofloxacin and oral antidiabetic agents, mainly sulfonylureas (for example, glyburide, glimepiride), were coadministered, presumably by intensifying the action of the oral antidiabetic agent (see 
                                    ADVERSE REACTIONS
                                 ). The concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin with glyburide has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia. Fatalities have been reported.

                              The serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were not altered when these two drugs were given concomitantly.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Cyclosporine
                           
                              Some quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine concomitantly.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Oral Anticoagulants
                           
                              Simultaneous administration of ciprofloxacin with an oral anticoagulant may augment the effect of the anticoagulant. The risk may vary with the underlying infection, age and general status of the patient so that the contribution of ciprofloxacin to the increase in INR (international normalized ratio) is difficult to assess. Prothrombin time and INR should be monitored frequently during and shortly after coadministration of ciprofloxacin with an oral anticoagulant (for example, warfarin).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Probenecid
                           
                              Probenecid interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and produces an increase in the level of ciprofloxacin in the serum. This should be considered if patients are receiving both drugs concomitantly.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Methotrexate
                           
                              Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate. This might increase the risk of methotrexate associated toxic reactions. Therefore, patients under methotrexate therapy should be carefully monitored when concomitant ciprofloxacin therapy is indicated.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Metoclopramide
                           
                              Metoclopramide significantly accelerates the absorption of oral ciprofloxacin resulting in shorter time to reach maximum plasma concentrations. No significant effect was observed on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Duloxetine
                           
                              In clinical studies it was demonstrated that concomitant use of duloxetine with strong inhibitors of the CYP450 1A2 isozyme such as fluvoxamine, may result in a 5 fold increase in mean AUC and a 2.5 fold increase in mean Cmax of duloxetine. Although no clinical data are available on a possible interaction with ciprofloxacin, similar effects can be expected upon concomitant administration.
