include reports concerning both oral and topical salicylate admin-
istration. The relationship of these interactions to the use of
Salicylic Acid 6% (w/w) Shampoo is not known.
I.Due to the competition of salicylate with other drugs for
bindingto serum albumin the following drug interactions may
occur:
DRUGDESCRIPTION OF INTERACTION
SulfonylureasHypoglycemia potentiated.
MethotrexateDecreases tubular reabsorption; clinical
toxicity from methotrexate can result.
OralIncreased bleeding.
Anticoagulants
II.Drugs changing salicylate levels by altering renal tubular
reabsorption:
DRUGDESCRIPTION OF INTERACTION
CorticosteroidsDecreases plasma salicylate level; tapering
doses of steroids may promote salicylism.
AcidifyingIncreases plasma salicylate level.
Agents
AlkanizingDecreased plasma salicylate levels.
Agents
III.Drugs with complicated interactions with salicylates:
DRUGDESCRIPTION OF INTERACTION
HeparinSalicylate decreases platelet adhesiveness
and interferes with hemostasis in heparin
treated patients.
Pyrazinamide
Inhibits pyrazinamide-induced
uricemia.
hyper-
UricosuricEffect of probenemide, sulfinpyrazone and
phenylbutazone inhibited.
The following alterations of laboratory tests have been reported
during salicylate therapy:
