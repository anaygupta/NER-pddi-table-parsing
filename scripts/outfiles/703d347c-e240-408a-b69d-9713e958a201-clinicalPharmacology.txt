                  During the initial 24 hours following intravenous injection of Technetium Tc 99m Medronate, about 50% of each dose is retained in the skeleton, and about 50% is excreted in the urine. Upon intravenous injection, Technetium Tc 99m Medronate exhibits a specific affinity for areas of altered osteogenesis. In humans, blood levels fall to 4 to 10% of the injected dose by two hours post-injection and to 3 to 5% by three hours.
                  Uptake of Technetium Tc 99m Medronate Injection in bone appears to be related to osteogenic activity and to skeletal blood perfusion. The deposition in the skeleton is bilaterally symmetrical, with increased accumulation in the axial structure as compared to the appendicular skeleton. There is increased activity in the distal aspect on long bones as compared to the diaphyses.
