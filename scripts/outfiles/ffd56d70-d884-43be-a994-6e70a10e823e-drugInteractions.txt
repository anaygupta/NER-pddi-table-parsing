                           Acidifying Agents

                           Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines. 
                        
                           Urinary Acidifying Agents

                           (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.
                        
                           Adrenergic Blockers

                           Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines.
                        
                           Alkalinizing Agents

                           Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (sodium bicarbonate, etc.) increase absorption of amphetamines. Coadministration of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate, dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine sulfate and gastrointestinal alkalizing agents, such as antacids, should be avoided. Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents increase blood levels and therefore potentiate the actions of amphetamines.
                        
                           Antidepressants, Tricyclic

                           Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents; d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated.
                        
                           MAO Inhibitors

                           MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism. This slowing potentiates amphetamines, increasing their effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings; this can cause headaches and other signs of hypertensive crisis. A variety of neurological toxic effects and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur, sometimes with fatal results.
                        
                           Antihistamines

                           Amphetamines may counteract the sedative effect of antihistamines.
                        
                           Antihypertensives

                           Amphetamines may antagonize the hypotensive effects of antihypertensives.
                        
                           Chlorpromazine

                           Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines, and can be used to treat amphetamine poisoning.
                        
                           Ethosuximide

                           Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of ethosuximide.
                        
                           Haloperidol

                           Haloperidol blocks dopamine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines.
                        
                           Lithium Carbonate

                           The anorectic and stimulatory effects of amphetamines may be inhibited by lithium carbonate.
                        
                           Meperidine

                           Amphetamines potentiate the analgesic effect of meperidine.
                        
                           Methenamine Therapy

                           Urinary excretion of amphetamines is increased, and efficacy is reduced, by acidifying agents used in methenamine therapy.
                        
                           Norepinephrine

                           Amphetamines enhance the adrenergic effect of norepinephrine.
                        
                           Phenobarbital

                           Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenobarbital; coadministration of phenobarbital may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action.
                        
                           Phenytoin

                           Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenytoin; coadministration of phenytoin may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action.
                        
                           Propoxyphene

                           In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur.
                        Proton Pump Inhibitors
PPIs act on proton pumps by blocking acid production, thereby reducing gastric acidity. When of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate, dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine sulfate extended-release (20 mg single-dose) was administered concomitantly with the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole (40 mg once daily for 14 days), the median Tmax of d- amphetamine was decreased by 1.25 hours (from 4 to 2.75 hours), and the median Tmax of l-amphetamine was decreased by 2.5 hours (from 5.5 to 3 hours), compared to dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate, dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine sulfate extended-release administered alone. The AUC and Cmax of each moiety were unaffected. Therefore, coadministration of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate, dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine sulfate and proton pump inhibitors should be monitored for changes in clinical effect.
                        Veratrum Alkaloids
Amphetamines inhibit the hypotensive effect of veratrum alkaloids.
