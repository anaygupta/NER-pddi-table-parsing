                        Use of DICLEGIS is contraindicated in women who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Concurrent use of alcohol and other CNS depressants (such as hypnotic sedatives and tranquilizers) with DICLEGIS is not recommended.

                        A food-effect study demonstrated that the delay in the onset of action of DICLEGIS may be further delayed, and a reduction in absorption may occur when tablets are taken with food 
                              [see Dosage and Administration (2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, DICLEGIS should be taken on an empty stomach with a glass of water [
