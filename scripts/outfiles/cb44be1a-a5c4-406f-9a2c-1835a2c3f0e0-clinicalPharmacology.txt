Mechanism of Action
Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal models.  The mechanism of action of meloxicam, like that of other NSAIDs, may be related to prostaglandin synthetase (cyclo-oxygenase) inhibition.







Pharmacokinetics
Absorption Absorption The absolute bioavailability of meloxicam capsules was 89% following a single oral dose of 30 mg compared with 30 mg IV bolus injection.  Following single intravenous doses, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were shown in the range of 5 mg to 60 mg.  After multiple oral doses the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam capsules were dose-proportional over the range of 7.5 mg to 15 mg.  Mean Cmax was achieved within four to five hours after a 7.5 mg meloxicam tablet was taken under fasted conditions, indicating a prolonged drug absorption.  With multiple dosing, steady state concentrations were reached by Day 5.  A second meloxicam concentration peak occurs around 12 to 14 hours post-dose suggesting biliary recycling.max was achieved within four to five hours after a 7.5 mg meloxicam tablet was taken under fasted conditions, indicating a prolonged drug absorption.  With multiple dosing, steady state concentrations were reached by Day 5.  A second meloxicam concentration peak occurs around 12 to 14 hours post-dose suggesting biliary recycling.

The time to maximum concentration (Tmax) was achieved between 5 and 6 hours.  No pharmacokinetic interaction was detected with concomitant administration of antacids.  Based on these results, meloxicam can be administered without regard to timing of meals or concomitant administration of antacids.max) being increased by approximately 22% while the extent of absorption (AUC) was unchanged.  The time to maximum concentration (TDistributionDistributionThe mean volume of distribution (Vss) of meloxicam is approximately 10 L.  Meloxicam is ~ 99.4% bound to human plasma proteins (primarily albumin) within the therapeutic dose range.  The fraction of protein binding is independent of drug concentration, over the clinically relevant concentration range, but decreases to ~ 99% in patients with renal disease. Meloxicam penetration into human red blood cells, after oral dosing, is less than 10%. Following a radiolabeled dose, over 90% of the radioactivity detected in the plasma was present as unchanged meloxicam.Meloxicam concentrations in synovial fluid, after a single oral dose, range from 40% to 50% of those in plasma.  The free fraction in synovial fluid is 2.5 times higher than in plasma, due to the lower albumin content in synovial fluid as compared to plasma.  The significance of this penetration is unknown.MetabolismMetabolismMeloxicam is almost completely metabolized to four pharmacologically inactive metabolites.  The major metabolite, 5'-carboxy meloxicam (60% of dose), from P-450 mediated metabolism was formed by oxidation of an intermediate metabolite 5'‑hydroxymethyl meloxicam which is also excreted to a lesser extent (9% of dose).  In vitro studies indicate that cytochrome P-450 2C9 plays an important role in this metabolic pathway with a minor contribution of the CYP 3A4 isozyme. Patients’ peroxidase activity is probably responsible for the other two metabolites which account for 16% and 4% of the administered dose, respectively.In vitro studies indicate that cytochrome P-450 2C9 plays an important role in this metabolic pathway with a minor contribution of the CYP 3A4 isozyme. Patients’ peroxidase activity is probably responsible for the other two metabolites which account for 16% and 4% of the administered dose, respectively.ExcretionExcretionMeloxicam excretion is predominantly in the form of metabolites, and occurs to equal extents in the urine and feces.  Only traces of the unchanged parent compound are excreted in the urine (0.2%) and feces (1.6%).  The extent of the urinary excretion was confirmed for unlabeled multiple 7.5 mg doses: 0.5%, 6% and 13%of the dose were found in urine in the form of meloxicam, and the 5'‑hydroxymethyl and 5'‑carboxy metabolites, respectively.  There is significant biliary and/or enteral secretion of the drug.  This was demonstrated when oral administration of cholestyramine following a single IV dose of meloxicam decreased the AUC of meloxicam by 50%.The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) ranges from 15 hours to 20 hours. The elimination half-life is constant across dose levels indicating linear metabolism within the therapeutic dose range.  Plasma clearance ranges from 7 to 9 mL/min.1/2) ranges from 15 hours to 20 hours.

Special Populations
GeriatricGeriatricElderly males (≥ 65 years of age) exhibited meloxicam plasma concentrations and steady state pharmacokinetics similar to young males.  Elderly females (≥65 years of age) had a 47% higher AUCss and 32% higher Cmax,ss as compared to younger females (≤ 55 years of age) after body weight normalization.  Despite the increased total concentrations in the elderly females, the adverse event profile was comparable for both elderly patient populations.  A smaller free fraction was found in elderly female patients in comparison to elderly male patients.ss and 32% higher CGenderGenderYoung females exhibited slightly lower plasma concentrations relative to young males.  After single doses of 7.5 mg meloxicam, the mean elimination half-life was 19.5 hours for the female group as compared to 23.4 hours for the male group.  At steady state, the data were similar (17.9 hours vs. 21.4 hours).  This pharmacokinetics difference due to gender is likely to be of little clinical importance.  There was linearity of pharmaco-kinetics and no appreciable difference in the Cmax or Tmax across genders.max or THepatic InsufficiencyHepatic InsufficiencyFollowing a single 15 mg dose of meloxicam there was no marked difference in plasma concentrations in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class I) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class II) hepatic impairment compared to healthy volunteers.  Protein binding of meloxicam was not affected by hepatic insufficiency.  No dose adjustment is necessary in mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency.  Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class III) have not been adequately studied.Renal InsufficiencyRenal InsufficiencyMeloxicam pharmacokinetics have been investigated in subjects with different degrees of renal insufficiency.  Total drug plasma concentrations decreased with the degree of renal impairment while free AUC values were similar.  Total clearance of meloxicam increased in these patients probably due to the increase in free fraction leading to an increased metabolic clearance.  There is no need for dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal failure (CrCL >15 mL/min). Patients with severe renal insufficiency have not been adequately studied.  The use of meloxicam in subjects with severe renal impairment is not recommended (see WARNINGS, Advanced Renal Disease).WARNINGS, HemodialysisHemodialysisFollowing a single dose of meloxicam, the free Cmax plasma concentrations were higher in patients with renal failure on chronic hemodialysis (1% free fraction) in comparison to healthy volunteers (0.3% free fraction).  Hemodialysis did not lower the total drug concentration in plasma; therefore, additional doses are not necessary after hemodialysis.  Meloxicam is not dialyzable.max plasma concentrations were higher in patients with renal failure on chronic hemodialysis (1% free fraction) in comparison to healthy volunteers (0.3% free fraction).
