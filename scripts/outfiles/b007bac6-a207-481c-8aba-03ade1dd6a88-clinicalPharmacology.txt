                  12.1 Mechanism of ActionThe mechanism of action of SEROQUEL, as with other drugs having 
efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is unknown. 
However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of SEROQUEL in schizophrenia and 
its mood stabilizing properties in bipolar depression and mania are mediated 
through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and 
serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Antagonism at 
receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar 
receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of SEROQUEL. 
                  SEROQUELâ€™s antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may 
explain the somnolence observed with this drug.
