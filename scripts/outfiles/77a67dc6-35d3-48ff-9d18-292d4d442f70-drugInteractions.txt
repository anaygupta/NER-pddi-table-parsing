                     7.1	Potential for Drugs to Affect Alvimopan Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        An in vitro study indicates that alvimopan is not a substrate of CYP enzymes. Therefore, concomitant administration of ENTEREG with inducers or inhibitors of CYP enzymes is unlikely to alter the metabolism of alvimopan. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Potential for Alvimopan to Affect the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs
                     
                        Based on in vitro data, ENTEREG is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs through inhibition of CYP isoforms such as 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, 2D6, and 2E1 or induction of CYP isoforms such as 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. 
                        
                           In vitro, ENTEREG did not inhibit p-glycoprotein. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	Effects of Alvimopan on Intravenous Morphine
                     
                        Coadministration of alvimopan does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of morphine and its metabolite, morphine-6-glucuronide, to a clinically significant degree when morphine is administered intravenously. Dosage adjustment for intravenously administered morphine is not necessary when it is coadministered with alvimopan. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4	Effects of Concomitant Acid Blockers or Antibiotics
                     
                        A population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that the pharmacokinetics of alvimopan were not affected by concomitant administration of acid blockers or antibiotics. No dosage adjustments are necessary in patients taking acid blockers or antibiotics.
