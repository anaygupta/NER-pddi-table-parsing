                        The interferons are a family of naturally occurring small proteins and glycoproteins with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to 27,600 daltons produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections and to synthetic or biological inducers.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Preclinical Pharmacology
                           
                              Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.  Once bound to the cell membrane, interferons initiate a complex sequence of intracellular events.  In vitro studies demonstrated that these include the induction of certain enzymes, suppression of cell proliferation, immunomodulating activities such as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells, and inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells.
                              In a study using human hepatoblastoma cell line HB 611, the in vitro antiviral activity of alpha interferon was demonstrated by its inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication.
                              The correlation between these in vitro data and the clinical results is unknown.  Any of these activities might contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Pharmacokinetics
                           
                              The pharmacokinetics of INTRONÂ® A were studied in 12 healthy male volunteers following single doses of 5 million IU/m2 administered intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and as a 30-minute intravenous infusion in a crossover design.
                              The mean serum INTRON A concentrations following intramuscular and subcutaneous injections were comparable.  The maximum serum concentrations obtained via these routes were approximately 18 to 116 IU/mL and occurred 3 to 12 hours after administration.  The elimination half-life of INTRON A following both intramuscular and subcutaneous injections was approximately 2 to 3 hours.  Serum concentrations were undetectable by 16 hours after the injections.
                              After intravenous administration, serum INTRON A concentrations peaked (135-273 IU/mL) by the end of the 30-minute infusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after intramuscular or subcutaneous drug administration, becoming undetectable 4 hours after the infusion.  The elimination half-life was approximately 2 hours.
                              Urine INTRON A concentrations following a single dose (5 million IU/m2) were not detectable after any of the parenteral routes of administration.  This result was expected since preliminary studies with isolated and perfused rabbit kidneys have shown that the kidney may be the main site of interferon catabolism.
                              There are no pharmacokinetic data available for the intralesional route of administration.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Serum Neutralizing Antibodies
                           
                              In INTRON A-treated patients tested for antibody activity in clinical trials, serum anti-interferon neutralizing antibodies were detected in 0% (0/90) of patients with hairy cell leukemia, 0.8% (2/260) of patients treated intralesionally for condylomata acuminata, and 4% (1/24) of patients with AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma. Serum neutralizing antibodies have been detected in less than 3% of patients treated with higher INTRON A doses in malignancies other than hairy cell leukemia or AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma.  The clinical significance of the appearance of serum anti-interferon neutralizing activity in these indications is not known.
                              Serum anti-interferon neutralizing antibodies were detected in 7% (12/168) of patients either during treatment or after completing 12 to 48 weeks of treatment with 3 million IU TIW of INTRON A therapy for chronic hepatitis C and in 13% (6/48) of patients who received INTRON A therapy for chronic hepatitis B at 5 million IU QD for 4 months, and in 3% (1/33) of patients treated at 10 million IU TIW.  Serum anti-interferon neutralizing antibodies were detected in 9% (5/53) of pediatric patients who received INTRON A therapy for chronic hepatitis B at 6 million IU/m2 TIW.  Among all chronic hepatitis B or C patients, pediatrics and adults with detectable serum neutralizing antibodies, the titers detected were low (22/24 with titers less than or equal to 1:40 and 2/24 with titers less than or equal to 1:160).  The appearance of serum anti-interferon neutralizing activity did not appear to affect safety or efficacy.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Hairy Cell Leukemia
                     
                        In clinical trials in patients with hairy cell leukemia, there was depression of hematopoiesis during the first 1 to 2 months of INTRON A treatment, resulting in reduced numbers of circulating red and white blood cells, and platelets.  Subsequently, both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients achieved substantial and sustained improvements in granulocytes, platelets, and hemoglobin levels in 75% of treated patients and at least some improvement (minor responses) occurred in 90%.  INTRON A treatment resulted in a decrease in bone marrow hypercellularity and hairy cell infiltrates.  The hairy cell index (HCI), which represents the percent of bone marrow cellularity times the percent of hairy cell infiltrate, was greater than or equal to 50% at the beginning of the study in 87% of patients.  The percentage of patients with such an HCI decreased to 25% after 6 months and to 14% after 1 year.  These results indicate that even though hematologic improvement had occurred earlier, prolonged INTRON A treatment may be required to obtain maximal reduction in tumor cell infiltrates in the bone marrow.
                        The percentage of patients with hairy cell leukemia who required red blood cell or platelet transfusions decreased significantly during treatment and the percentage of patients with confirmed and serious infections declined as granulocyte counts improved.  Reversal of splenomegaly and of clinically significant hypersplenism was demonstrated in some patients.
                        A study was conducted to assess the effects of extended INTRON A treatment on duration of response for patients who responded to initial therapy.  In this study, 126 responding patients were randomized to receive additional INTRON A treatment for 6 months or observation for a comparable period, after 12 months of initial INTRON A therapy.  During this 6-month period, 3% (2/66) of INTRON A-treated patients relapsed compared with 18% (11/60) who were not treated.  This represents a significant difference in time to relapse in favor of continued INTRON A treatment (P=0.006/0.01, Log Rank/Wilcoxon).  Since a small proportion of the total population had relapsed, median time to relapse could not be estimated in either group.  A similar pattern in relapses was seen when all randomized treatment, including that beyond 6 months, and available follow-up data were assessed.  The 15% (10/66) relapses among INTRON A patients occurred over a significantly longer period of time than the 40% (24/60) with observation (P=0.0002/0.0001, Log Rank/Wilcoxon).  Median time to relapse was estimated, using the Kaplan-Meier method, to be 6.8 months in the observation group but could not be estimated in the INTRON A group.
                        Subsequent follow-up with a median time of approximately 40 months demonstrated an overall survival of 87.8%.  In a comparable historical control group followed for 24 months, overall median survival was approximately 40%.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Malignant Melanoma
                     
                        The safety and efficacy of INTRON A was evaluated as adjuvant to surgical treatment in patients with melanoma who were free of disease (post surgery) but at high risk for systemic recurrence.  These included patients with lesions of Breslow thickness greater than 4 mm, or patients with lesions of any Breslow thickness with primary or recurrent nodal involvement.  In a randomized, controlled trial in 280 patients, 143 patients received INTRON A therapy at 20 million IU/m2 intravenously five times per week for 4 weeks (induction phase) followed by 10 million IU/m2 subcutaneously three times per week for 48 weeks (maintenance phase).  In the clinical trial, the median daily INTRON A dose administered to patients was 19.1 million IU/m2 during the induction phase and 9.1 million IU/m2 during the maintenance phase.  INTRON A therapy was begun less than or equal to 56 days after surgical resection.  The remaining 137 patients were observed.
                        INTRON A therapy produced a significant increase in relapse-free and overall survival.  Median time to relapse for the INTRON A-treated patients versus observation patients was 1.72 years versus 0.98 years (P<0.01, stratified Log Rank).  The estimated 5-year relapse-free survival rate, using the Kaplan-Meier method, was 37% for INTRON A-treated patients versus 26% for observation patients.  Median overall survival time for INTRON A-treated patients versus observation patients was 3.82 years versus 2.78 years (P=0.047, stratified Log Rank).  The estimated 5-year overall survival rate, using the Kaplan-Meier method, was 46% for INTRON A-treated patients versus 37% for observation patients.
                        In a second study of 642 resected high-risk melanoma patients, subjects were randomized equally to one of three groups: high-dose INTRON A therapy for 1 year (same schedule as above), low-dose INTRON A therapy for 2 years (3 MU/d TIW SC), and observation.  Consistent with the earlier trial, high-dose INTRON A therapy demonstrated an improvement in relapse-free survival (3-year estimated RFS 48% versus 41%; median RFS 2.4 versus 1.6 years, P=not significant).  Relapse-free survival in the low-dose INTRON A arm was similar to that seen in the observation arm.  Neither high-dose nor low-dose INTRON A therapy showed a benefit in overall survival as compared to observation in this study.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Follicular Lymphoma
                     
                        The safety and efficacy of INTRON A in conjunction with CHVP, a combination chemotherapy regimen, was evaluated as initial treatment in patients with clinically aggressive, large tumor burden, Stage III/IV follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  Large tumor burden was defined by the presence of any one of the following:  a nodal or extranodal tumor mass with a diameter of greater than 7 cm; involvement of at least three nodal sites (each with a diameter of greater than 3 cm); systemic symptoms; splenomegaly; serous effusion, orbital or epidural involvement; ureteral compression; or leukemia.
                        In a randomized, controlled trial, 130 patients received CHVP therapy and 135 patients received CHVP therapy plus INTRON A therapy at 5 million IU subcutaneously three times weekly for the duration of 18 months.  CHVP chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, and teniposide (VM-26) 60 mg/m2, administered intravenously on Day 1 and prednisone at a daily dose of 40 mg/m2 given orally on Days 1 to 5.  Treatment consisted of six CHVP cycles administered monthly, followed by an additional six cycles administered every 2 months for 1 year.  Patients in both treatment groups received a total of 12 CHVP cycles over 18 months.
                        The group receiving the combination of INTRON A therapy plus CHVP had a significantly longer progression-free survival (2.9 years versus 1.5 years, P=0.0001, Log Rank test).  After a median follow-up of 6.1 years, the median survival for patients treated with CHVP alone was 5.5 years while median survival for patients treated with CHVP plus INTRON A therapy had not been reached (P=0.004, Log Rank test).  In three additional published, randomized, controlled studies of the addition of interferon alpha to anthracycline-containing combination chemotherapy regimens,1-3 the addition of interferon alpha was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival.  Differences in overall survival were not consistently observed.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Condylomata Acuminata
                     
                        Condylomata acuminata (venereal or genital warts) are associated with infections of the human papilloma virus (HPV).  The safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of condylomata acuminata were evaluated in three controlled double-blind clinical trials.  In these studies, INTRON A doses of 1 million IU per lesion were administered intralesionally three times a week (TIW), in less than or equal to 5 lesions per patient for 3 weeks.  The patients were observed for up to 16 weeks after completion of the full treatment course.
                        INTRON A treatment of condylomata was significantly more effective than placebo, as measured by disappearance of lesions, decreases in lesion size, and by an overall change in disease status.  Of 192 INTRON A-treated patients and 206 placebo-treated patients who were evaluable for efficacy at the time of best response during the course of the study, 42% of INTRON A patients versus 17% of placebo patients experienced clearing of all treated lesions.  Likewise, 24% of INTRON A patients versus 8% of placebo patients experienced marked (75% to less than 100%) reduction in lesion size, 18% versus 9% experienced moderate (50% to 75%) reduction in lesion size, 10% versus 42% had a slight (less than 50%) reduction in lesion size, 5% versus 24% had no change in lesion size, and 0% versus 1% experienced exacerbation (P<0.001).
                        In one of these studies, 43% (54/125) of patients in whom multiple (less than or equal to 3) lesions were treated experienced complete clearing of all treated lesions during the course of the study. Of these patients, 81% remained cleared 16 weeks after treatment was initiated.
                        Patients who did not achieve total clearing of all their treated lesions had these same lesions treated with a second course of therapy.  During this second course of treatment, 38% to 67% of patients had clearing of all treated lesions.  The overall percentage of patients who had cleared all their treated lesions after two courses of treatment ranged from 57% to 85%.
                        INTRON A-treated lesions showed improvement within 2 to 4 weeks after the start of treatment in the above study; maximal response to INTRON A therapy was noted 4 to 8 weeks after initiation of treatment.
                        The response to INTRON A therapy was better in patients who had condylomata for shorter durations than in patients with lesions for a longer duration.
                        Another study involved 97 patients in whom three lesions were treated with either an intralesional injection of 1.5 million IU of INTRON A per lesion followed by a topical application of 25% podophyllin, or a topical application of 25% podophyllin alone.  Treatment was given once a week for 3 weeks.  The combined treatment of INTRON A and podophyllin was shown to be significantly more effective than podophyllin alone, as determined by the number of patients whose lesions cleared.  This significant difference in response was evident after the second treatment (Week 3) and continued through 8 weeks post-treatment.  At the time of the patient's best response, 67% (33/49) of the INTRON A- and podophyllin-treated patients had all three treated lesions clear while 42% (20/48) of the podophyllin-treated patients had all three clear (P=0.003).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma
                     
                        The safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), a common manifestation of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), were evaluated in clinical trials in 144 patients.
                        In one study, INTRON A doses of 30 million IU/m2 were administered subcutaneously three times per week (TIW) to patients with AIDS-Related KS.  Doses were adjusted for patient tolerance.  The average weekly dose delivered in the first 4 weeks was 150 million IU; at the end of 12 weeks this averaged 110 million IU/week; and by 24 weeks averaged 75 million IU/week.
                        Forty-four percent of asymptomatic patients responded versus 7% of symptomatic patients.  The median time to response was approximately 2 months and 1 month, respectively, for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.  The median duration of response was approximately 3 months and 1 month, respectively, for the asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.  Baseline T4/T8 ratios were 0.46 for responders versus 0.33 for nonresponders.
                        In another study, INTRON A doses of 35 million IU were administered subcutaneously, daily (QD), for 12 weeks. Maintenance treatment, with every other day dosing (QOD), was continued for up to 1 year in patients achieving antitumor and antiviral responses.  The median time to response was 2 months and the median duration of response was 5 months in the asymptomatic patients.
                        In all studies, the likelihood of response was greatest in patients with relatively intact immune systems as assessed by baseline CD4 counts (interchangeable with T4 counts).  Results at doses of 30 million IU/m2 TIW and 35 million IU/QD were subcutaneously similar and are provided together in TABLE 1. This table demonstrates the relationship of response to baseline CD4 count in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in the 30 million IU/m2 TIW and the 35 million IU/QD treatment groups.
                        In the 30 million IU study group, 7% (5/72) of patients were complete responders and 22% (16/72) of the patients were partial responders.  The 35 million IU study had 13% (3/23 patients) complete responders and 17% (4/23) partial responders.
                        For patients who received 30 million IU TIW, the median survival time was longer in patients with CD4 greater than 200 (30.7 months) than in patients with CD4 less than or equal to 200 (8.9 months).  Among responders, the median survival time was 22.6 months versus 9.7 months in nonresponders.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Chronic Hepatitis C
                     
                        The safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C was evaluated in 5 randomized clinical studies in which an INTRON A dose of 3 million IU three times a week (TIW) was assessed.  The initial three studies were placebo-controlled trials that evaluated a 6-month (24-week) course of therapy.  In each of the three studies, INTRON A therapy resulted in a reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in a greater proportion of patients versus control patients at the end of 6 months of dosing.  During the 6 months of follow-up, approximately 50% of the patients who responded maintained their ALT response.  A combined analysis comparing pretreatment and post-treatment liver biopsies revealed histological improvement in a statistically significantly greater proportion of INTRON A-treated patients compared to controls.
                        Two additional studies have investigated longer treatment durations (up to 24 months).5,6  Patients in the two studies to evaluate longer duration of treatment had hepatitis with or without cirrhosis in the absence of decompensated liver disease.  Complete response to treatment was defined as normalization of the final two serum ALT levels during the treatment period. A sustained response was defined as a complete response at the end of the treatment period, with sustained normal ALT values lasting at least 6 months following discontinuation of therapy.
                        In Study 1, all patients were initially treated with INTRON A 3 million IU TIW subcutaneously for 24 weeks (run-in-period).  Patients who completed the initial 24-week treatment period were then randomly assigned to receive no further treatment, or to receive 3 million IU TIW for an additional 48 weeks.  In Study 2, patients who met the entry criteria were randomly assigned to receive INTRON A 3 million IU TIW subcutaneously for 24 weeks or to receive INTRON A 3 million IU TIW subcutaneously for 96 weeks.  In both studies, patient follow-up was variable and some data collection was retrospective.
                        Results show that longer durations of INTRON A therapy improved the sustained response rate (see TABLE 2).  In patients with complete responses (CR) to INTRON A therapy after 6 months of treatment (149/352 [42%]), responses were less often sustained if drug was discontinued (21/70 [30%]) than if it was continued for 18 to 24 months (44/79 [56%]).  Of all patients randomized, the sustained response rate in the patients receiving 18 or 24 months of therapy was 22% and 26%, respectively, in the two trials.  In patients who did not have a CR by 6 months, additional therapy did not result in significantly more responses, since almost all patients who responded to therapy did so within the first 16 weeks of treatment.
                        A subset (less than 50%) of patients from the combined extended dosing studies had liver biopsies performed both before and after INTRON A treatment.  Improvement in necroinflammatory activity as assessed retrospectively by the Knodell (Study 1) and Scheuer (Study 2) Histology Activity Indices was observed in both studies.  A higher number of patients (58%, 45/78) improved with extended therapy than with shorter (6 months) therapy (38%, 34/89) in this subset.
                        Combination treatment with INTRON A and REBETOLÂ® (ribavirin USP) provided a significant reduction in virologic load and improved histologic response in adult patients with compensated liver disease who were treatment-naÃ¯ve or had relapsed following therapy with alpha interferon alone; pediatric patients previously untreated with alpha interferon experienced a sustained virologic response.

                              The safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B were evaluated in three clinical trials in which INTRON A doses of 30 to 35 million IU per week were administered subcutaneously (SC), as either 5 million IU daily (QD), or 10 million IU three times a week (TIW) for 16 weeks versus no treatment.  All patients were 18 years of age or older with compensated liver disease, and had chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (serum HBsAg positive for at least 6 months) and HBV replication (serum HBeAg positive).  Patients were also serum HBV-DNA positive, an additional indicator of HBV replication, as measured by a research assay.7,8 All patients had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver biopsy findings compatible with the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis.  Patients with the presence of antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) or antibody to hepatitis delta virus (anti-HDV) in the serum were excluded from the studies.
                              Virologic response to treatment was defined in these studies as a loss of serum markers of HBV replication (HBeAg and HBV DNA).  Secondary parameters of response included loss of serum HBsAg, decreases in serum ALT, and improvement in liver histology.
                              In each of two randomized controlled studies, a significantly greater proportion of INTRON A-treated patients exhibited a virologic response compared with untreated control patients (see TABLE 3).  In a third study without a concurrent control group, a similar response rate to INTRON A therapy was observed.  Pretreatment with prednisone, evaluated in two of the studies, did not improve the response rate and provided no additional benefit.
                              The response to INTRON A therapy was durable. No patient responding to INTRON A therapy at a dose of 5 million IU QD or 10 million IU TIW relapsed during the follow-up period, which ranged from 2 to 6 months after treatment ended.  The loss of serum HBeAg and HBV DNA was maintained in 100% of 19 responding patients followed for 3.5 to 36 months after the end of therapy.
                              In a proportion of responding patients, loss of HBeAg was followed by the loss of HBsAg.  HBsAg was lost in 27% (4/15) of patients who responded to INTRON A therapy at a dose of 5 million IU QD, and 35% (8/23) of patients who responded to 10 million IU TIW.  No untreated control patient lost HBsAg in these studies.
                              In an ongoing study to assess the long-term durability of virologic response, 64 patients responding to INTRON A therapy have been followed for 1.1 to 6.6 years after treatment; 95% (61/64) remain serum HBeAg negative, and 49% (30/61) lost serum HBsAg.
                              INTRON A therapy resulted in normalization of serum ALT in a significantly greater proportion of treated patients compared to untreated patients in each of two controlled studies (see TABLE 4).  In a third study without a concurrent control group, normalization of serum ALT was observed in 50% (12/24) of patients receiving INTRON A therapy.
                              Virologic response was associated with a reduction in serum ALT to normal or near normal (less than or equal to 1.5 Ã the upper limit of normal) in 87% (13/15) of patients responding to INTRON A therapy at 5 million IU QD, and 100% (23/23) of patients responding to 10 million IU TIW.
                              Improvement in liver histology was evaluated in Studies 1 and 3 by comparison of pretreatment and 6-month post-treatment liver biopsies using the semiquantitative Knodell Histology Activity Index.9 No statistically significant difference in liver histology was observed in treated patients compared to control patients in Study 1.  Although statistically significant histological improvement from baseline was observed in treated patients in Study 3 (Pâ¤0.01), there was no control group for comparison.  Of those patients exhibiting a virologic response following treatment with 5 million IU QD or 10 million IU TIW, histological improvement was observed in 85% (17/20) compared to 36% (9/25) of patients who were not virologic responders.  The histological improvement was due primarily to decreases in severity of necrosis, degeneration, and inflammation in the periportal, lobular, and portal regions of the liver (Knodell Categories I + II + III).  Continued histological improvement was observed in four responding patients who lost serum HBsAg and were followed 2 to 4 years after the end of INTRON A therapy.10

                              The safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B was evaluated in one randomized controlled trial of 149 patients ranging from 1 year to 17 years of age.  Seventy-two patients were treated with 3 million IU/m2 of INTRON A therapy administered subcutaneously three times a week (TIW) for 1 week; the dose was then escalated to 6 million IU/m2 TIW for a minimum of 16 weeks up to 24 weeks.  The maximum weekly dosage was 10 million IU TIW.  Seventy-seven patients were untreated controls.  Study entry and response criteria were identical to those described in the adult patient population.
                              Patients treated with INTRON A therapy had a better response (loss of HBV DNA and HBeAg at 24 weeks of follow-up) compared to the untreated controls (24% [17/72] versus 10% [8/77] P=0.05).  Sixteen of the 17 responders treated with INTRON A therapy remained HBV DNA and HBeAg negative and had a normal serum ALT 12 to 24 months after completion of treatment.  Serum HBsAg became negative in 7 out of 17 patients who responded to INTRON A therapy.  None of the control patients who had an HBV DNA and HBeAg response became HBsAg negative.  At 24 weeks of follow-up, normalization of serum ALT was similar in patients treated with INTRON A therapy (17%, 12/72) and in untreated control patients (16%, 12/77).  Patients with a baseline HBV DNA less than 100 pg/mL were more likely to respond to INTRON A therapy than were patients with a baseline HBV DNA greater than 100 pg/mL (35% versus 9%, respectively).  Patients who contracted hepatitis B through maternal vertical transmission had lower response rates than those who contracted the disease by other means (5% versus 31%, respectively).  There was no evidence that the effects on HBV DNA and HBeAg were limited to specific subpopulations based on age, gender, or race.
