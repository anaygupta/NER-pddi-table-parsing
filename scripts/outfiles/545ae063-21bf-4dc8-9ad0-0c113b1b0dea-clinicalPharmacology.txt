                  Antihistaminic, decongestant and antitussive actions.
                  Chlorpheniramine maleate possesses H1 antihistaminic activity and mild anticholinergic and sedative effects. Peak plasma concentration is reached in 5 hours. Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination. The liver is assumed to be the major site of metabolic transformation.
                  Phenylephrine hydrochloride is an oral sympathomimetic amine that acts as a decongestant to respiratory tract mucous membranes. While its vasoconstrictor action is similar to that of ephedrine, phenylephrine has less pressor effect in normotensive adults. Serum half-life for phenylephrine is 6 to 8 hours. Acidic urine is associated with faster elimination of the drug. About one-half of the administered dose is excreted in the urine.
                  Dextromethorphan hydrobromide is a non-narcotic antitussive with effectiveness equal to codeine. It acts in the medulla oblongata to elevate the cough threshold. Dextromethorphan does not produce analgesia or induce tolerance, and has no potential for addiction. At usual doses, it will not depress respiration or inhibit ciliary activity. Dextromethorphan is rapidly metabolized with trace amounts of the parent compound in blood and urine. About one-half of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as conjugated metabolites.
