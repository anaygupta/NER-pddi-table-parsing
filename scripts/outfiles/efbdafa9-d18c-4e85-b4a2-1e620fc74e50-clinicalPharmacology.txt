                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Idelalisib is an inhibitor of PI3Kδ kinase, which is expressed in normal and malignant B-cells. Idelalisib induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in cell lines derived from malignant B-cells and in primary tumor cells. Idelalisib inhibits several cell signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and the CXCR4 and CXCR5 signaling, which are involved in trafficking and homing of B-cells to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. Treatment of lymphoma cells with idelalisib resulted in inhibition of chemotaxis and adhesion, and reduced cell viability.

                                 Electrocardiographic Effects
                              
                              The effect of Zydelig (150 mg and 400 mg) on the QT/QTc interval was evaluated in a placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) crossover study in 46 healthy subjects. At a dose 2.7 times the maximum recommended dose, Zydelig did not prolong the QT/QTc interval (i.e., not greater than or equal to 10 ms).

                                 Absorption
                              
                              Following oral administration of a single dose of Zydelig in the fasted state, the median T
           
 
  max was observed at 1.5 hours.
          

 
                              Idelalisib exposure increased in a less than dose-proportional manner over a dose range of 50 mg to 350 mg twice daily in the fasted state.
                              Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of Zydelig with a high-fat meal increased idelalisib AUC 1.4-fold. Zydelig can be administered without regard to food.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Distribution
                              
                              Idelalisib is greater than 84% bound to human plasma proteins with no concentration dependence. The mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.7. The population apparent central volume of distribution at steady state is 23 L.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Metabolism and Elimination
                              
                              Idelalisib is metabolized to its major metabolite GS-563117 via aldehyde oxidase and CYP3A. GS-563117 is inactive against PI3Kδ in vitro. Idelalisib undergoes minor metabolism by UGT1A4.
                              The population apparent systemic clearance at steady-state is 14.9 L/hr. The population terminal elimination half-life of idelalisib is 8.2 hours. Following a single dose of 150 mg of [
           
 
  14C] idelalisib, 78% and 14% of the radioactivity was excreted in feces and urine, respectively. GS-563117 accounted for 49% of the radioactivity in the urine and 44% in the feces.

                                    A pharmacokinetic study following a single dose of 150 mg of Zydelig was performed in healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min). Creatinine clearance had no effect on idelalisib exposure. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with CLcr ≥15 mL/min.

                                    A pharmacokinetic study of Zydelig was performed in healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic impairment. The geometric mean AUC increased up to 1.7-fold in subjects with ALT or AST or bilirubin values greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) compared to subjects with normal AST or ALT or bilirubin values. Limited safety and efficacy data are available for patients with baseline AST or ALT greater than 2.5 × ULN or bilirubin greater than 1.5 × ULN, as these patients were excluded from Studies 1 and 2. Patients with baseline hepatic impairment should be monitored for signs of Zydelig toxicity

                                    Idelalisib is a substrate for aldehyde oxidase, CYP3A, and UGT1A4 in vitro. 
                                    Idelalisib inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A, and UGT1A1 and GS-563117 inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A and UGT1A1 in vitro. Idelalisib and GS-563117 are not likely to inhibit CYP1A, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6. 
                                    Idelalisib induces CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, but does not induce CYP1A2 in vitro. GS-563117 does not induce these enzymes.
                                    Idelalisib and GS-563117 are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP in vitro. Idelalisib is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. GS-563117 is not a substrate of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3.
                                    Idelalisib inhibits P-gp, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, and GS-563117 inhibits OATP1B1, OATP1B3 in vitro.

                                    A single dose of 150 mg of Zydelig was administered alone and after rifampin (a strong CYP3A and P-gp inducer) 600 mg once daily for 8 days in healthy subjects. Rifampin decreased the geometric mean idelalisib AUC by 75% and the geometric mean C
             
 
  max by 58%. Avoid coadministration of Zydelig with strong CYP3A and P-gp inducers.
            

 
                                    A single dose of 400 mg of Zydelig was administered alone and after ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitor) 400 mg daily for 4 days in healthy subjects. Ketoconazole increased the geometric mean idelalisib AUC by 1.8-fold. No changes in the geometric mean C

                                          Effect of Idelalisib on Other Drugs
                                       
                                    
                                    A single oral dose of midazolam 5 mg was administered alone and after Zydelig 150 mg for 15 doses in healthy subjects. The geometric mean midazolam Cmax increased by 2.4-fold and the geometric mean midazolam AUC increased by 5.4-fold. Avoid coadministration of Zydelig with CYP3A substrates, as Zydelig is a strong CYP3A inhibitor.
                                    A single dose of 10 mg of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate) was administered alone and after Zydelig 150 mg for 12 doses in healthy subjects. No changes in exposure to rosuvastatin were observed.
                                    A single dose of 0.5 mg of digoxin (P-gp substrate) was administered alone and after Zydelig 150 mg for 19 doses in healthy subjects. No changes in exposure to digoxin were observed.
