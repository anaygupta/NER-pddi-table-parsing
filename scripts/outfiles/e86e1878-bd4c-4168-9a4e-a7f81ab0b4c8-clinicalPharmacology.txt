                  Mechanism of Action

                     PRECAUTIONS.) Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity.
ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of Lisinopril Tablets remains to be elucidated.
While the mechanism through which Lisinopril Tablets lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, Lisinopril Tablets are antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although Lisinopril Tablets were antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to monotherapy than non-Black patients.
Concomitant administration of Lisinopril Tablets and hydrochlorothiazide further reduced blood pressure in Black and non-Black patients and any racial differences in blood pressure response was no longer evident.
