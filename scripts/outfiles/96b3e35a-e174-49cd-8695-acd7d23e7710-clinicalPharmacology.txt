                  An in vitro percutaneous penetration study comparing Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1%/5% and topical 1% clindamycin gel alone, demonstrated there was no statistical difference in penetration between the two drugs. Mean systemic bioavailability of topical clindamycin in Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1%/5% is suggested to be less than 1%.
                  Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid. Less than 2% of the dose enters systemic circulation as benzoic acid. It is suggested that the lipophilic nature of benzoyl peroxide acts to concentrate the compound into the lipid-rich sebaceous follicle.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics 
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics (plasma and urine) of clindamycin from Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1%/5% was studied in male and female patients (n=13) with acne vulgaris. Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1%/5% (~2g) was applied topically to the face and back twice daily for four and a half (4.5) days. Quantifiable (>LOQ=1ng/mL) clindamycin plasma concentrations were obtained in six of thirteen subjects (46.2%) on Day 1 and twelve of thirteen subjects (92.3%) on Day 5. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of clindamycin ranged from 1.47 ng/mL to 2.77 ng/mL on Day 1 and 1.43 ng/mL to 7.18 ng/mL on Day 5. The AUC (0-12h) ranged from 2.74 ng.h/mL to 12.86 ng.h/mL on Day 1 and 11.4 ng.h/mL to 69.7 ng.h/mL on Day 5.
                        The amount of clindamycin excreted in the urine during the 12 hour dosing interval increased from a mean (SD) of 5745 (3130) ng on Day 1 to 12069 (7660) ng on Day 5. The mean % (SD) of the administered dose that was excreted in the urine ranged from 0.03% (0.02) to 0.08% (0.04).
                        A comparison of the single (Day 1) and multiple (Day 5) dose plasma urinary concentrations of clindamycin indicates that there is accumulation of clindamycin following multiple dosing of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1%/5%. The degree of accumulation calculated from the plasma and urinary excretion data was ~2-fold.

                        The clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide components individually have been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris; however, the clinical significance of this activity against P. acnes was not examined in clinical trials with this product.
