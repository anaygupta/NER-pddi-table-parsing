                  Renacidin Irrigation's action on susceptible apatite calculi results from an exchange of magnesium from the irrigating solution for calcium contained in the stone matrix. The magnesium salts thereby formed are soluble in the gluconocitrate irrigating solution resulting in the dissolution of the calculus. Struvite calculi are composed mainly of magnesium ammonium phosphates which are solubilized by Renacidin Irrigation due to its acidic pH.
  Renacidin Irrigation is not effective for dissolution of calcium oxalate, uric acid or cysteine stones.
