                        studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 206 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 206 isozyme include the following drug classes; tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g. f1ecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of Terbinafine Hydrochloride Tablets should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine hydrochloride.
                                    In vivo
                        
                        studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, and cyclosporine.
                                    In vitro
                        
                        drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin.
                                    In vivo
                        
                        Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%.
                        There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between Terbinafine Hydrochloride Tablets and these changes has not been established.
                        Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, aCYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine.
                        There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, theophyllines, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers.
