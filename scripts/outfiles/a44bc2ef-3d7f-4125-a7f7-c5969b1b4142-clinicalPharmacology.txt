                  VisionBlue™ selectively stains connective tissue structures in the human eye such as the anterior lens capsule of the human crystalline lens.

                     
VisionBlue™ is intended to be applied directly on the anterior lens capsule, staining any portion of the capsule which comes in contact with the dye. Excess dye is washed out of the anterior chamber. The dye does not penetrate the capsule, permitting visualization of the anterior capsule in contrast to the non‑stained lens cortex and inner lens material.
