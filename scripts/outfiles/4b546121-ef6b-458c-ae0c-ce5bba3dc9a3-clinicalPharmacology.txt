                  Mechanism of ActionDesloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist 
with selective H1-receptor histamine antagonist activity. 
Receptor binding data indicate that at a concentration of 2–3 ng/mL (7 
nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine 
H1-receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release 
from human mast cells in vitro.
                  Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand 
H1-receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that 
desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier.
                  
                  Pharmacokinetics
                  AbsorptionFollowing oral administration of desloratadine 5 mg once daily 
for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma 
concentrations (Tmax) occurred at approximately 3 hours 
post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 4 
ng/mL and 56.9 ng∙hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit 
juice had an effect on the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) 
of desloratadine.
                  The pharmacokinetic profile of CLARINEX Syrup was evaluated in a three-way 
crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of CLARINEX Syrup 
containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg 
CLARINEX Tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) of CLARINEX Syrup.
                  The pharmacokinetic profile of CLARINEX RediTabs Tablets was evaluated in a 
three-way crossover study in 24 adult volunteers. A single CLARINEX RediTabs 
Tablet containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single 5 mg 
CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet (original formulation) for both desloratadine and 
3-hydroxydesloratadine. Water had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and 
Cmax) of CLARINEX RediTabs Tablets.
                  
                  DistributionDesloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 
87% and 85% to 89%, bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of 
desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired 
renal function.
                  
                  MetabolismDesloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively 
metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is 
subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 
3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials 
indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 
3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In 
pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor 
metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 
3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a 
desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies 
included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects 
aged 2–5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6–11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12–70 
years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age 
groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as 
compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1063). The median 
exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 
6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who 
are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and 
will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the 
recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where 
metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 
normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with CLARINEX Syrup for 15–35 
days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between 
poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, 
an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor 
metabolizers cannot be ruled out.
                  
                  EliminationThe mean elimination half-life of desloratadine was 27 hours. 
Cmax and AUC values increased in a dose proportional 
manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of 
accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and 
dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of 
approximately 87% of the 14C-desloratadine dose, which 
was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of 
plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar Tmax and 
half-life values compared to desloratadine.
                  
                  
                  Special Populations
                  GeriatricIn older subjects (> 65 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose 
administration of CLARINEX Tablets, the mean Cmax and AUC 
values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (< 65 
years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight 
was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of 
desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects > 65 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 
3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. 
These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no 
dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects.
                  
                  Pediatric SubjectsIn subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of CLARINEX 
Syrup containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine resulted in desloratadine plasma 
concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg 
CLARINEX Tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of 
CLARINEX Syrup containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine resulted in desloratadine 
plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 
5 mg CLARINEX Tablet. However, the Cmax and AUCt of the metabolite (3-OH desloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 
times higher for the 5 mg dose of syrup administered in adults compared to the 
Cmax and AUCt obtained in children 
2–11 years of age receiving 1.25–2.5 mg of CLARINEX Syrup.
                  A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of CLARINEX Syrup containing 1.25 
mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 
11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 
months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain 
desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults 
administered a single 5 mg dose of CLARINEX Syrup.
                  The CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet 2.5 mg tablet has not been evaluated in 
pediatric patients. Bioequivalence of the CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet and the 
original CLARINEX RediTabs Tablets was established in adults. In conjunction 
with the dose finding studies in pediatrics described, the pharmacokinetic data 
for CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet supports the use of the 2.5 mg dose strength in 
pediatric patients 6–11 years of age.
                  
                  Renally ImpairedDesloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg 
were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51–69 
mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 
34–43 mL/min/1.73 m2), and severe (n=6; creatinine 
clearance 5–29 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment or 
hemodialysis-dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal 
impairment, median Cmax and AUC values increased by 
approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal 
renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were 
hemodialysis dependent, Cmax and AUC values increased by 
approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 
3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 
3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein 
binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal 
impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended 
(see 
                        DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                      
section).
                  
                  Hepatically ImpairedDesloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a 
single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) 
hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic 
function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic 
impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC 
as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine 
in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 
28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean 
elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was 
observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean Cmax and 
AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically 
significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage 
adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended (see 
                        DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                      section).
                  
                  GenderFemale subjects treated for 14 days with CLARINEX Tablets had 10% 
and 3% higher desloratadine Cmax and AUC values, 
respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine Cmax and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, 
respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent 
differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage 
adjustment is recommended.
                  
                  RaceFollowing 14 days of treatment with CLARINEX Tablets, the Cmax and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, 
respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine 
there was a corresponding 10% reduction in Cmax and AUC 
values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be 
clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        Drug InteractionsIn two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in 
healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, 
desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered 
with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 
10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology 
studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with 
azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with 
fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with 
fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) 
under steady state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. 
Although increased plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC 
0–24 hrs) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 1), there were no clinically relevant changes in the 
safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters 
(including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 
and adverse events.
                        
                        


                        



                        Pharmacodynamics
                        Wheal and FlareHuman histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 
5 mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic 
effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was 
no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the 
desloratadine 5 mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical 
relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown.
                        
                        Effects on QTc
                        Single dose administration of desloratadine did not alter the 
corrected QT interval (QTc) in rats (up to 12 mg/kg, 
oral), or guinea pigs (25 mg/kg, intravenous). Repeated oral administration at 
doses up to 24 mg/kg for durations up to 3 months in monkeys did not alter the 
QTc at an estimated desloratadine exposure (AUC) that was 
approximately 955 times the mean AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral 
dose. See

                        Clinical Trials
                        Seasonal Allergic RhinitisThe clinical efficacy and safety of CLARINEX Tablets were 
evaluated in over 2,300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic 
rhinitis. A total of 1,838 patients received 2.5–20 mg/day of CLARINEX in four 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' 
duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies 
demonstrated the efficacy and safety of CLARINEX 5 mg in the treatment of adult 
and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose ranging 
trial, CLARINEX 2.5–20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day 
were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 
mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed 
at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to 
placebo (2.3%).
                        In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal 
allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily 
improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This 
supports the safety of administering CLARINEX Tablets to adult patients with 
seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma.
                        CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom 
Scores (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in 
patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 
2.

at least 6 and a total non-nasal symptom score (sum of 4 individual symptoms) of 
at least 5 (each symptom scored 0 to 3 where 0=no symptom and 3=severe symptoms) 
was required for trial eligibility. TSS ranges from 0=no symptoms to 24=maximal 
symptoms.†Mean reduction in TSS averaged over the 2-week treatment period.

                        

                        There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of CLARINEX 
Tablets 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race.
                        
                        Perennial Allergic RhinitisThe clinical efficacy and safety of CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg were 
evaluated in over 1,300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic 
rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of CLARINEX in two 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks' 
duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these 
studies CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce 
symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 3).

ranges from 0=no symptoms to 24=maximal symptoms.†Mean reduction in TSS averaged over the 4-week treatment period.

                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        Chronic Idiopathic UrticariaThe efficacy and safety of CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily was 
studied in 416 chronic idiopathic urticaria patients 12 to 84 years of age, of 
whom 211 received CLARINEX. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized 
clinical trials of six weeks' duration, at the pre-specified one-week primary 
time point evaluation, CLARINEX Tablets significantly reduced the severity of 
pruritus when compared to placebo (Table 4). Secondary 
endpoints were also evaluated and during the first week of therapy CLARINEX 
Tablets 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, "Number of Hives" and the "Size of 
the Largest Hive," when compared to placebo.

                        The clinical safety of CLARINEX Syrup was documented in three, 15-day, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled safety studies in pediatric subjects with a 
documented history of allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, or 
subjects who were candidates for antihistamine therapy. In the first study, 2.5 
mg of CLARINEX Syrup was administered to 60 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of 
age. The second study evaluated 1.25 mg of CLARINEX Syrup administered to 55 
pediatric subjects 2 to 5 years of age. In the third study, 1.25 mg of CLARINEX 
Syrup was administered to 65 pediatric subjects 12 to 23 months of age and 1.0 
mg of CLARINEX Syrup was administered to 66 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 months of 
age. The results of these studies demonstrated the safety of CLARINEX Syrup in 
pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age.
