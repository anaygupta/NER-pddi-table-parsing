                     Carbamazepine and other enzyme inducers decrease plasma concentrations of risperidone. Increase the RISPERDAL® dose up to double the patient's usual dose. Titrate slowly. (7.1)
                     Fluoxetine, paroxetine, and other CYP 2D6 enzyme inhibitors increase plasma concentrations of risperidone. Reduce the initial dose. Do not exceed a final dose of 8 mg per day of RISPERDAL®. (7.1)
                  
                  
 

                  
                  The dose of RISPERDAL® should be adjusted when used in combination with CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, and paroxetine) and enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) [see Table 18 and Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Dose adjustment is not recommended for RISPERDAL® when co-administered with ranitidine, cimetidine, amitriptyline, or erythromycin [see Table 18].

                     Effect of Risperidone on other drugs
                  
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Lithium
                  
                  Repeated oral doses of RISPERDAL® (3 mg twice daily) did not affect the exposure (AUC) or peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of lithium (n=13). Dose adjustment for lithium is not recommended.
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Valproate
                  
                  Repeated oral doses of  RISPERDAL® (4 mg once daily) did not affect the pre-dose or average plasma concentrations and exposure (AUC) of valproate (1000 mg/day in three divided doses) compared to placebo (n=21). However, there was a 20% increase in valproate peak plasma concentration (Cmax) after concomitant administration of  RISPERDAL®. Dose adjustment for valproate is not recommended.
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Digoxin
                  
                  RISPERDAL® (0.25 mg twice daily) did not show a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Dose adjustment for digoxin is not recommended.
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Centrally-Acting Drugs and Alcohol
                  
                  Given the primary CNS effects of risperidone, caution should be used when RISPERDAL® is taken in combination with other centrally-acting drugs and alcohol.
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Drugs with Hypotensive Effects
                  
                  Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, RISPERDAL® may enhance the hypotensive effects of other therapeutic agents with this potential.
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists
                  
                  RISPERDAL® may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Clozapine
                  
                  Chronic administration of clozapine with RISPERDAL® may decrease the clearance of risperidone.
