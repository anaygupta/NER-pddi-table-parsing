Drug/Drug Interactions
Propranolol Hydrochloride:Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine should be closely observed if propranolol hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are administered. The added catecholamine-blocking action may produce an excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous activity, which may result in hypotension, marked bradycardia, vertigo, syncopal attacks, or orthostatic hypotension.Caution should be exercised when patients receiving a beta blocker are administered a calcium-channel blocking drug, especially intravenous verapamil, for both agents may depress myocardial contractility or atrioventricular conduction. On rare occasions, the concomitant intravenous use of a beta blocker and verapamil has resulted in serious adverse reactions, especially in patients with severe cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or recent myocardial infarction.Blunting of the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported.Hypotension and cardiac arrest have been reported with the concomitant use of propranolol and haloperidol.Aluminum hydroxidegel greatly reduces intestinal absorption of propranolol.Aluminum hydroxidegel greatly reduces intestinal absorption of propranolol.Ethanolslows the rate of absorption of propranolol.Ethanolslows the rate of absorption of propranolol.Phenytoin, phenobarbitone,and rifampinaccelerate propranolol clearance.Phenytoin, phenobarbitone,and Chlorpromazine, when used concomitantly with propranolol, results in increased plasma levels of both drugs.Chlorpromazine, when used concomitantly with propranolol, results in increased plasma levels of both drugs.Antipyrineand lidocainehave reduced clearance when used concomitantly with propranolol.Antipyrineand Thyroxinemay result in a lower than expected T3 concentration when used concomitantly with propranolol.Thyroxinemay result in a lower than expected TCimetidinedecreases the hepatic metabolism of propranolol, delaying elimination and increasing blood levels.Cimetidinedecreases the hepatic metabolism of propranolol, delaying elimination and increasing blood levels.Theophyllineclearance is reduced when used concomitantly with propranolol.Theophyllineclearance is reduced when used concomitantly with propranolol.Hydrochlorothiazide:Thiazide drugs may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine.Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine. This diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged.Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of corticosteroids or ACTH. ACTH. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Hydrochlorothiazide:Thiazides may decrease serum PBI levels without signs of thyroid disturbance.Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function (see PRECAUTIONS — General).PRECAUTIONS — General).
