activity during oral rinsing. The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinseâ€™s
antimicrobial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general
reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from
54-97% through six months use. 

                  
                  Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month clinical study did not result in any
significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or
other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine
gluconate oral rinse use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to
baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at
baseline.
