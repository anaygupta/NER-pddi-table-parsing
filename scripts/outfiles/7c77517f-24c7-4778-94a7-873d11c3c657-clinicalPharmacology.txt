                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Bepotastine is a topically active, direct H1-receptor antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine from mast cells.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        
                           Absorption:  The extent of systemic exposure to bepotastine following topical ophthalmic administration of bepotastine besilate 1% and 1.5% ophthalmic solutions was evaluated in 12 healthy adults.  Following one drop of 1% or 1.5% bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution to both eyes four time daily (QID) for seven days, bepotastine plasma concentrations peaked at approximately one to two hours post-instillation.  Maximum plasma concentration for the 1% and 1.5% strengths were 5.1 ± 2.5 ng/mL and 7.3 ± 1.9 ng/mL, respectively.  Plasma concentration at 24 hours post-instillation were below the quantifiable limit (2ng/mL) in 11/12 subjects in the two dose groups.
                        
                           Dtistribution: The extent of protein binding of bepotastine is approximately 55% and independent of bepotastine concentration.
                        
                           Metabolism:
                           In vitro metabolism studies with human liver microsomes demonstrated that bepotastine is minimally metabolized by CYP450 isozymes.
                        
                           In vitro studies demonstrated that bepotastine besilate does not inhibit the metabolism of various cytochrome P450 substrate via inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.  The effect of bepotastine besilate on the metabolism of substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2D6 was not studied.  Bepotastine besilate has a low potential for drug interaction via inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.
                        
                           Excretion: The main route of elimination of bepotastine besilate is urinary excretion (with approximately 75-90% excreted unchanged in urine).
