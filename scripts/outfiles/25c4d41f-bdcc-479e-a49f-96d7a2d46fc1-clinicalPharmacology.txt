                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions are pharmacologically inactive. The electrolyte concentrations in the solutions are chosen to restore plasma levels to clinically desired concentrations or maintain plasma levels at the desired concentrations.
                        PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions are used as replacement solution to replace water and electrolytes removed during hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration. Bicarbonate (or precursor lactate) in the solution is used as an alkalinizing buffer to restore acid-base balance to a clinically desirable level.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The distribution of electrolytes, bicarbonate, and dextrose is determined by the patient's clinical condition, metabolic status, and residual renal function.
                        The elimination and replacement of water, electrolytes and buffer depend on the patient's electrolyte and acid-base balance, metabolic status, residual renal function and ongoing physiologic losses through intestinal, respiratory and cutaneous routes.
