                  No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with XEOMIN.
                  Coadministration of XEOMIN and aminoglycoside antibiotics or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission, e.g., tubocurarine-type muscle relaxants, should only be performed with caution as these agents may potentiate the effect of the toxin.
                  Use of anticholinergic drugs after administration of XEOMIN may potentiate systemic anticholinergic effects.
                  The effect of administering different botulinum toxin products at the same time or within several months of each other is unknown. Excessive neuromuscular weakness may be exacerbated by administration of another botulinum toxin prior to the resolution of the effects of a previously administered botulinum toxin. Excessive weakness may also be exaggerated by administration of a muscle relaxant before or after administration of XEOMIN.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Concomitant treatment of XEOMIN and aminoglycoside antibiotics, spectinomycin, or other agents that interfere with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., tubocurarine-like agents), or muscle relaxants, should be observed closely because the effect of XEOMIN may be potentiated (7).
