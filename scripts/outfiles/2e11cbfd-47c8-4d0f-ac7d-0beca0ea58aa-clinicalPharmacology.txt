                           Pharmacokinetics: In a multiple dose pharmacokinetic study that included 5 male patients with interdigital tinea pedis (range of diseased area, 42 - 140 cm2; mean, 93 cm2), ERTACZO® Cream, 2%, was topically applied every 12 hours for a total of 13 doses to the diseased skin (0.5 grams sertaconazole nitrate per 100 cm2 ). Sertaconazole concentrations in plasma measured by serial blood sampling for 72 hours after the thirteenth dose were below the limit of quantitation (2.5 ng/mL) of the analytical method used.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           Microbiology: Sertaconazole is an antifungal that belongs to the imidazole class of antifungals. While the exact mechanism of action of this class of antifungals is not known, it is believed that they act primarily by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol. Ergosterol is a key component of the cell membrane of fungi, and lack of this component leads to fungal cell injury primarily by leakage of key constituents in the cytoplasm from the cell.
