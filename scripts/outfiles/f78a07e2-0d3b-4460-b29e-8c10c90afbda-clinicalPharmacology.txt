                  Cisatracurium binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in block of neuromuscular transmission.  This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        The neuromuscular blocking potency of cisatracurium is approximately threefold that of atracurium besylate.  The time to maximum block is up to 2 minutes longer for equipotent doses of cisatracurium compared to atracurium besylate.  The clinically effective duration of action and rate of spontaneous recovery from equipotent doses of cisatracurium and atracurium besylate are similar. 
                        

                        The average ED95 (dose required to produce 95% suppression of the adductor pollicis muscle twitch response to ulnar nerve stimulation) of cisatracurium is 0.05 mg/kg (range: 0.048 to 0.053) in adults receiving opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia.  For comparison, the average ED95 for atracurium when also expressed as the parent bis-cation is 0.17 mg/kg under similar anesthetic conditions. 
                        

                        The pharmacodynamics of 2 x ED95 to 8 x ED95 doses of cisatracurium administered over 5 to 10 seconds during opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia are summarized in Table 1.  When the dose is doubled, the clinically effective duration of block increases by approximately 25 minutes.  Once recovery begins, the rate of recovery is independent of dose. 
                        

                        Isoflurane or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses, and decrease the average infusion rate requirement of cisatracurium.  The magnitude of these effects may depend on the duration of administration of the volatile agents.  Fifteen to 30 minutes of exposure to 1.25 MAC isoflurane or enflurane had minimal effects on the duration of action of initial doses of cisatracurium and therefore, no adjustment to the initial dose should be necessary when cisatracurium is administered shortly after initiation of volatile agents.  In long surgical procedures during enflurane or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of cisatracurium may be necessary.  The average infusion rate requirement may be decreased by as much as 30% to 40%. 
                        

                        The onset, duration of action, and recovery profiles of cisatracurium during propofol/oxygen or propofol/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia are similar to those during opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia.

                        When administered during the induction of adequate anesthesia using propofol, nitrous oxide/oxygen, and co-induction agents (e.g., fentanyl and midazolam), GOOD or EXCELLENT conditions for tracheal intubation occurred in 96/102 (94%) patients in 1.5 to 2 minutes following 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium and in 97/110 (88%) patients in 1.5 minutes following 0.2 mg/kg cisatracurium. 
                        

                        In one intubation study during thiopental anesthesia in which fentanyl and midazolam were administered two minutes prior to induction, intubation conditions were assessed at 120 seconds.  Table 2 displays these results in this study of 51 patients.

While GOOD or EXCELLENT intubation conditions were achieved in the majority of patients in this setting, EXCELLENT intubation conditions were more frequently achieved with the 0.2 mg/kg dose (60%) than the 0.15 mg/kg dose (31%) when intubation was attempted 2 minutes following cisatracurium. 
                        

                        A second study evaluated intubation conditions after 3 and 4 x ED95 (0.15 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) following induction with fentanyl and midazolam and either thiopental or propofol anesthesia.  This study compared intubation conditions produced by these doses of cisatracurium after 1.5 minutes.  Table 3 displays these results.

EXCELLENT intubation conditions were more frequently observed with the 0.2 mg/kg dose when intubation was attempted 1.5 minutes following cisatracurium. 
                        

                        A third study in pediatric patients (ages 1 month to 12 years) evaluated intubation conditions at 120 seconds after 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium following induction with either halothane (with halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen maintenance) or thiopentone and fentanyl (with thiopentone/fentanyl nitrous oxide/oxygen maintenance).  The results are summarized in Table 4.

** Excellent: Easy passage of the tube without coughing.  Vocal cords relaxed and abducted. 
                        

                        
                           Good: Passage of tube with slight coughing and/or bucking.  Vocal cords relaxed and abducted. 
                        

                        
                           Poor: Passage of tube with moderate coughing and/or bucking.  Vocal cords moderately adducted. 
                        

                        Response of patient requires adjustment of ventilation pressure and/or rate. 
                        

                        EXCELLENT or GOOD intubating conditions were produced 120 seconds following 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium in 88/90 (98%) of patients induced with halothane and in 85/90 (94%) of patients induced with thiopentone and fentanyl.  There were no patients for whom intubation was not possible, but there were 7/120 patients ages 1 to 12 years for whom intubating conditions were described as poor. 
                        

                        Repeated administration of maintenance doses or a continuous infusion of cisatracurium for up to 3 hours is not associated with development of tachyphylaxis or cumulative neuromuscular blocking effects.  The time needed to recover from successive maintenance doses does not change with the number of doses administered as long as partial recovery is allowed to occur between doses.  Maintenance doses can therefore be administered at relatively regular intervals with predictable results.  The rate of spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function after infusion is independent of the duration of infusion and comparable to the rate of recovery following initial doses (Table 1). 
                        

                        Long-term infusion (up to 6 days) of cisatracurium during mechanical ventilation in the ICU has been evaluated in two studies.  In a randomized, double-blind study using presence of a single twitch during train-of-four (TOF) monitoring to regulate dosage, patients treated with cisatracurium (n = 19) recovered neuromuscular function (T4:T1 ratio ≥ 70%) following termination of infusion in approximately 55 minutes (range: 20 to 270) whereas those treated with vecuronium (n = 12) recovered in 178 minutes (range: 40 minutes to 33 hours).  In another study comparing cisatracurium and atracurium, patients recovered neuromuscular function in approximately 50 minutes for both cisatracurium (range: 20 to 175; n = 34) and atracurium (range: 35 to 85; n = 15). 
                        

                        The neuromuscular block produced by cisatracurium is readily antagonized by anticholinesterase agents once recovery has started.  As with other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the more profound the neuromuscular block at the time of reversal, the longer the time required for recovery of neuromuscular function. 
                        

                        In children (2 to 12 years) cisatracurium has a lower ED95 than in adults (0.04 mg/kg, halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia).  At 0.1 mg/kg during opioid anesthesia, cisatracurium had a faster onset and shorter duration of action in children than in adults (Table 1).  Recovery following reversal is faster in children than in adults. 
                        

                        At 0.15 mg/kg during opioid anesthesia, cisatracurium had a faster onset and longer clinically effective duration of action in infants aged 1 to 23 months compared to children aged 2 to 12 years (Table 1). 
                        

                        Studies were conducted during both opioid-based and halothane-based anesthesia in children aged 1 to 11 months, 1 to 4 years, and 5 to 12 years. Cisatracurium had a faster onset and longer duration of action in infants 1 to 11 months compared to children 1 to 4 years, who in turn have a faster onset and longer duration of action for cisatracurium compared to children 5 to 12 years. 
                        

                        The mean time to onset of maximum T1  suppression was generally faster for pediatric patients induced with halothane compared to thiopentone/fentanyl and the clinically effective duration (time to 25% recovery) was longer (by up to 15%) for pediatric patients under halothane anesthesia.

                        The cardiovascular profile of cisatracurium allows it to be administered by rapid bolus at higher multiples of the ED95 than atracurium.  Cisatracurium has no dose-related effects on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) or heart rate (HR) following doses ranging from 2 to 8 x ED95 (> 0.1 to > 0.4 mg/kg), administered over 5 to 10 seconds, in healthy adult patients (Figure 1) or in patients with serious cardiovascular disease (Figure 2).
                        A total of 141 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have been administered cisatracurium in three active controlled clinical trials and have received doses ranging from 2 to 8 x ED95.  While the hemodynamic profile was comparable in both the cisatracurium and active control groups, data for doses above 0.3 mg/kg in this population are limited.
                        Unlike atracurium, cisatracurium, at therapeutic doses of 2 x ED95 to 8 x ED95 (0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg), administered over 5 to 10 seconds, does not cause dose-related elevations in mean plasma histamine concentration.

                        The neuromuscular blocking activity of cisatracurium is due to parent drug.  Cisatracurium plasma concentration-time data following IV bolus administration are best described by a two-compartment open model (with elimination from both compartments) with an elimination half-life (t1/2β) of 22 minutes, a plasma clearance (CL) of 4.57 mL/min/kg, and a volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of 145 mL/kg.  Cisatracurium undergoes organ-independent Hofmann elimination (a chemical process dependent on pH and temperature) to form the monoquaternary acrylate metabolite and laudanosine, neither of which has any neuromuscular blocking activity (see

                           ).  Following administration of radiolabeled cisatracurium, 95% of the dose was recovered in the urine; less than 10% of the dose was excreted as unchanged parent drug.  Laudanosine, a metabolite of cisatracurium (and atracurium) has been noted to cause transient hypotension and, in higher doses, cerebral excitatory effects when administered to several animal species.  The relationship between CNS excitation and laudanosine concentrations in humans has not been established (see

                           ).  Because cisatracurium is three times more potent than atracurium and lower doses are required, the corresponding laudanosine concentrations following cisatracurium are one third of those that would be expected following an equipotent dose of atracurium (see

                        The magnitude of interpatient variability in CL was low (16%), as expected based on the importance of Hofmann elimination (see

                        Conventional pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that the pharmacokinetics of cisatracurium are proportional to dose between 0.1 (2 x ED95) and 0.2 (4 x ED95) mg/kg cisatracurium.  In addition, population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed no statistically significant effect of initial dose on CL for doses between 0.1 (2 x ED95) and 0.4 (8 x ED95) mg/kg cisatracurium.

                        The volume of distribution of cisatracurium is limited by its large molecular weight and high polarity.  The Vss was equal to 145 mL/kg (Table 4) in healthy 19- to 64-year-old surgical patients receiving opioid anesthesia.  The Vss was 21% larger in similar patients receiving inhalation anesthesia (see

                        The binding of cisatracurium to plasma proteins has not been successfully studied due to its rapid degradation at physiologic pH.  Inhibition of degradation requires nonphysiological conditions of temperature and pH which are associated with changes in protein binding.

                            experiments suggest that cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination (a pH and temperature-dependent chemical process) to form laudanosine (see

                           ) and the monoquaternary acrylate metabolite.  The monoquaternary acrylate undergoes hydrolysis by non-specific plasma esterases to form the monoquaternary alcohol (MQA) metabolite.  The MQA metabolite can also undergo Hofmann elimination but at a much slower rate than cisatracurium.  Laudanosine is further metabolized to desmethyl metabolites which are conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the urine.
                        

                        Organ-independent Hofmann elimination is the predominant pathway for the elimination of cisatracurium.  The liver and kidney play a minor role in the elimination of cisatracurium but are primary pathways for the elimination of metabolites.  Therefore, the t1/2ß values of metabolites (including laudanosine) are longer in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and metabolite concentrations may be higher after long-term administration (see

                        Mean CL values for cisatracurium ranged from 4.5 to 5.7 mL/min/kg in studies of healthy surgical patients.  Compartmental pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that approximately 80% of the CL is accounted for by Hofmann elimination and the remaining 20% by renal and hepatic elimination.  These findings are consistent with the low magnitude of interpatient variability in CL (16%) estimated as part of the population PK/PD analyses and with the recovery of parent and metabolites in urine.  Following 14C-cisatracurium administration to 6 healthy male patients, 95% of the dose was recovered in the urine (mostly as conjugated metabolites) and 4% in the feces; less than 10% of the dose was excreted as unchanged parent drug in the urine.  In 12 healthy surgical patients receiving non-radiolabeled cisatracurium who had Foley catheters placed for surgical management, approximately 15% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine.
                        

                        In studies of healthy surgical patients, mean t1/2β values of cisatracurium ranged from 22 to 29 minutes and were consistent with the t1/2β of cisatracurium

                           (29 minutes).  The mean ± SD t1/2β values of laudanosine were 3.1 ± 0.4 and 3.3 ± 2.1 hours in healthy surgical patients receiving cisatracurium (n = 10) or atracurium (n = 10), respectively.  During IV infusions of cisatracurium, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of laudanosine and the MQA metabolite are approximately 6% and 11% of the parent compound, respectively.

                        The results of conventional pharmacokinetic analysis from a study of 12 healthy elderly patients and 12 healthy young adult patients receiving a single IV dose of 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium are summarized in Table 6.  Plasma clearances of cisatracurium were not affected by age; however, the volumes of distribution were slightly larger in elderly patients than in young patients resulting in slightly longer t1/2β values for cisatracurium. The rate of equilibration between plasma cisatracurium concentrations and neuromuscular block was slower in elderly patients than in young patients (mean ± SD keo: 0.071 ± 0.036 and 0.105 ± 0.021 minutes-1, respectively); there was no difference in the patient sensitivity to cisatracurium-induced block, as indicated by EC50 values (mean ± SD EC50: 91 ± 22 and 89 ± 23 ng/mL, respectively).  These changes were consistent with the 1-minute slower times to maximum block in elderly patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium, when compared to young patients receiving the same dose.  The minor differences in PK/PD parameters of cisatracurium between elderly patients and young patients were not associated with clinically significant differences in the recovery profile of cisatracurium.

                        Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that patients with creatinine clearances  ≤ 70 mL/min had a slower rate of equilibration between plasma concentrations and neuromuscular block than patients with normal renal function; this change was associated with a slightly slower (~ 40 seconds) predicted time to 90% T1 suppression in patients with renal dysfunction following 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium.  There was no clinically significant alteration in the recovery profile of cisatracurium in patients with renal dysfunction.  The recovery profile of cisatracurium is unchanged in the presence of renal or hepatic failure, which is consistent with predominantly organ-independent elimination.

                        Plasma metabolite pharmacokinetics are listed in Table 9.  Limited pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with liver/kidney dysfunction receiving cisatracurium.  Data from studies of atracurium demonstrate that renal/hepatic failure in ICU patients produces little to no effect on its pharmacokinetics, but decreases the biotransformation and elimination of the metabolites.  Following atracurium, t1/2β values for laudanosine were longer in ICU patients with renal failure than in ICU patients with normal renal function (15 and 6 hours, respectively).  The t1/2β values of laudanosine were 39 ± 14 hours in ICU patients with liver failure receiving atracurium after an unsuccessful liver transplantation and 5 ± 2 hours in similar ICU patients after successful liver transplantation. Therefore, relative to ICU patients with normal renal and hepatic function receiving cisatracurium, metabolite concentrations (plasma and tissues) may be higher in ICU patients with renal or hepatic failure (see

                        The population PK/PD of cisatracurium were described in 20 healthy pediatric patients during halothane anesthesia, using the same model developed for healthy adult patients. The CL was higher in healthy pediatric patients (5.89 mL/min/kg) than in healthy adult patients (4.57 mL/min/kg) during opioid anesthesia.  The rate of equilibration between plasma concentrations and neuromuscular block, as indicated by keo, was faster in healthy pediatric patients receiving halothane anesthesia (0.133 minutes-1) than in healthy adult patients receiving opioid anesthesia (0.0575 minutes-1). The EC50 in healthy pediatric patients (125 ng/mL) was similar to the value in healthy adult patients (141 ng/mL) during opioid anesthesia.  The minor differences in the PK/PD parameters of cisatracurium were associated with a faster time to onset and a shorter duration of cisatracurium-induced neuromuscular block in pediatric patients.

                        Population PK/PD analyses revealed that gender and obesity were associated with statistically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of cisatracurium; these factors were not associated with clinically significant alterations in the predicted onset or recovery profile of cisatracurium.  The use of inhalation agents was associated with a 21% larger Vss , a 78% larger keo, and a 15% lower EC50 for cisatracurium.  These changes resulted in a slightly faster (~ 45 seconds) predicted time to 90% T1 suppression in patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium during inhalation anesthesia than in patients receiving the same dose of cisatracurium during opioid anesthesia; however, there were no clinically significant differences in the predicted recovery profile of cisatracurium between patient groups.

                        The long-term infusion (up to 6 days) of cisatracurium during mechanical ventilation in the ICU has been evaluated in two studies.  Average infusion rates of approximately 3 mcg/kg/min (range: 0.5 to 10.2) were required to achieve adequate neuromuscular block.  As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, these data indicate the presence of wide interpatient variability in dosage requirements.  In addition, dosage requirements may increase or decrease with time (see 
                              
                                 PRECAUTIONS
                              
                           ).  Use of cisatracurium in the ICU for longer than 6 days has not been studied.

                        Persons with certain pre-existing conditions or receiving certain drugs may require individualization of dosing (see

                        Patients with burns have been shown to develop resistance to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, and may require individualization of dosing (see
