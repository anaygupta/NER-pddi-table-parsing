                           Theophylline
                           
                              Twelve healthy male volunteers were administered one 200-mg ceftibuten capsule twice daily for 6 days. With the morning dose of ceftibuten on day 6, each volunteer received a single intravenous infusion of theophylline (4 mg/kg). The pharmacokinetics of theophylline were not altered. The effect of ceftibuten on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline administered orally has not been investigated.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Antacids or H2-receptor antagonists
                           
                              The effect of increased gastric pH on the bioavailability of ceftibuten was evaluated in 18 healthy adult volunteers. Each volunteer was administered one 400-mg ceftibuten capsule. A single dose of liquid antacid did not affect the Cmax or AUC of ceftibuten; however, 150 mg of ranitidine q12h for 3 days increased the ceftibuten Cmax by 23% and ceftibuten AUC by 16%. The clinical relevance of these increases is not known.
