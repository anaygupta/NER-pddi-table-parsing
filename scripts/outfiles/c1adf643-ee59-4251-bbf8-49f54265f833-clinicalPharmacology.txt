                  An in vitro percutaneous penetration study comparing BenzaClin Topical Gel and topical 1% clindamycin gel alone, demonstrated there was no statistical difference in penetration between the two drugs.  Mean systemic bioavailability of topical clindamycin in BenzaClin Topical Gel is suggested to be less than 1%.
                  Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid.  Less than 2% of the dose enters systemic circulation as benzoic acid. It is suggested that the lipophilic nature of benzoyl peroxide acts to concentrate the compound into the lipid-rich sebaceous follicle.

                        The clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide components individually have been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris; however, the clinical significance of this activity against P. acnes was not examined in clinical trials with this product.
