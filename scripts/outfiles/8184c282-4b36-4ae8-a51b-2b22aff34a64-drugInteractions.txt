                     7.1 Beta-blockers
                     
                        Patients taking beta-blockers might be expected to have a greater increase in both pulse and blood pressure, an increase of which will be temporary because of glucagon’s short half-life. The increase in blood pressure and pulse rate may require therapy in patients with pheochromocytoma or coronary artery disease. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Indomethacin
                     
                        When used with indomethacin, glucagon may lose its ability to raise blood glucose or may even produce hypoglycemia. Therefore, caution should be exercised for patients taking indomethacin when glucagon will be administered.

                        Coadministration with an anticholinergic drug is not recommended due to increased gastrointestinal side effects.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Warfarin
                     
                        Glucagon may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Therefore, caution should be exercised for patients taking warfarin when glucagon will be administered.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Insulin
                     
                        Insulin reacts antagonistically towards glucagon. Therefore, caution should be exercised when glucagon is used as a diagnostic aid in diabetes patients.
