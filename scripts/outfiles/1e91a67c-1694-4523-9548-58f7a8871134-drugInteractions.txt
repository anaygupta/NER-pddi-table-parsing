                        In patients who are receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, reactivity to the test may be depressed or suppressed. This reduced reactivity may be present for as long as 5–6 weeks after discontinuation of therapy (see 
                              PRECAUTIONS – General
                           ).9 
                        
                        The reactivity to PPD may be temporarily depressed by certain live virus vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, yellow fever, and varicella). Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be administered either before the live vaccine or given simultaneously, but at a separate site than the live vaccine, or testing should be postponed for 4–6 weeks.9
