                  As the principal cation of the intracellular fluid, potassium
                            plays an important role in fluid and electrolyte balance. The normal
                            potassium concentration in the intracellular fluid compartment is about
                            160 mEq/liter. The normal serum potassium range is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter.
                            The kidney normally regulates potassium balance but does not conserve
                            potassium as well or as promptly as it conserves sodium. The daily
                            turnover of potassium in the normal adult averages 50 to 150 mEq
                            (milliequivalents) and represents 1.5 to 5% of the total potassium
                            content of the body.

                                (CH3COO−), a source of hydrogen ion
                            acceptors, is an alternate source of bicarbonate
                                (HCO3
                     −) by metabolic conversion in the
                            liver. This has been shown to proceed readily, even in the presence of
                            severe liver disease.
