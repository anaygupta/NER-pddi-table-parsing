                        Efavirenz is an antiviral drug
[see Clinical Pharmacology  (12.4)
                           ].

                           Absorption
                           
                              Peak efavirenz plasma concentrations
of 1.6-9.1 μM were attained by 5 hours following single oral doses of 100
mg to 1600 mg administered to uninfected volunteers. Dose-related increases
in Cmax and AUC were seen for doses up to 1600 mg;
the increases were less than proportional suggesting diminished absorption
at higher doses. 
                              In HIV-1-infected patients at
steady state, mean Cmax, mean Cmin,
and mean AUC were dose proportional following 200-mg, 400-mg, and 600-mg daily
doses. Time-to-peak plasma concentrations were approximately 3-5 hours and
steady-state plasma concentrations were reached in 6-10 days. In 35 patients
receiving SUSTIVA 600 mg once daily, steady-state Cmax was
12.9 ± 3.7 μM (mean ± SD), steady-state Cmin was 5.6 ± 3.2 μM, and AUC was 184 ± 73 μM•h.

                                       Capsules:   Administration
of a single 600-mg dose of efavirenz capsules with a high-fat/high-caloric
meal (894 kcal, 54 g fat, 54% calories from fat) or a reduced-fat/normal-caloric
meal (440 kcal, 2 g fat, 4% calories from fat) was associated with a mean
increase of 22% and 17% in efavirenz AUC∞ and a mean
increase of 39% and 51% in efavirenz Cmax, respectively,
relative to the exposures achieved when given under fasted conditions. See Dosage

tablet with a high-fat/high-caloric meal (approximately 1000 kcal, 500-600
kcal from fat) was associated with a 28% increase in mean AUC∞ of
efavirenz and a 79% increase in mean Cmax of efavirenz
relative to the exposures achieved under fasted conditions. See Dosage

                              Efavirenz is highly bound (approximately
99.5-99.75%) to human plasma proteins, predominantly albumin. In HIV-1 infected
patients (n=9) who received SUSTIVA 200 to 600 mg once daily for at least
one month, cerebrospinal fluid concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 1.19% (mean
0.69%) of the corresponding plasma concentration. This proportion is approximately
3-fold higher than the non-protein-bound (free) fraction of efavirenz in plasma.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Metabolism
                           
                              Studies in humans and in vitro  studies
using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that efavirenz is principally
metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system to hydroxylated metabolites with
subsequent glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites. These metabolites
are essentially inactive against HIV-1. The in vitro studies
suggest that CYP3A and CYP2B6 are the major isozymes responsible for efavirenz
metabolism. 
                              Efavirenz has been shown to induce
CYP enzymes, resulting in the induction of its own metabolism. Multiple doses
of 200-400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent
of accumulation (22-42% lower) and a shorter terminal half-life of 40-55 hours
(single dose half-life 52-76 hours). 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Elimination
                           
                              Efavirenz has a terminal half-life
of 52-76 hours after single doses and 40-55 hours after multiple doses. A
one-month mass balance/excretion study was conducted using 400 mg per day
with a 14C-labeled dose administered on Day 8.
Approximately 14-34% of the radiolabel was recovered in the urine and 16-61%
was recovered in the feces. Nearly all of the urinary excretion of the radiolabeled
drug was in the form of metabolites. Efavirenz accounted for the majority
of the total radioactivity measured in feces.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Special Populations
                           
                              
                                 Gender and race:   The
pharmacokinetics of efavirenz in patients appear to be similar between men
and women and among the racial groups studied.
                              
                                 Renal
impairment:  The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied
in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of efavirenz is
excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz
elimination should be minimal.
                              
                                 Hepatic impairment: A multiple-dose study showed no significant effect on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) compared with controls. There were insufficient data to determine whether moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) affects efavirenz pharmacokinetics.
										
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Drug Interaction Studies
                           
                              Efavirenz has been shown in
vivo to cause hepatic enzyme induction, thus increasing the biotransformation
of some drugs metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2B6. In vitro studies have
shown that efavirenz inhibited CYP isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4 with Ki  values
(8.5-17 μM) in the range of observed efavirenz plasma concentrations. In in
vitro studies, efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6
and CYP1A2 (Ki  values 82-160 μM) only at concentrations
well above those achieved clinically. The inhibitory effect on CYP3A is expected
to be similar between 200-mg, 400-mg, and 600-mg doses of efavirenz. Coadministration
of efavirenz with drugs primarily metabolized by 2C9, 2C19, and 3A isozymes
may result in altered plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug. Drugs
which induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of
efavirenz resulting in lowered plasma concentrations.
                              Drug
interaction studies were performed with efavirenz and other drugs likely to
be coadministered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction.
The effects of coadministration of efavirenz on the Cmax,
AUC, and Cmin are summarized in  Table 8 (effect of
efavirenz on other drugs) and  Table 9 (effect of other drugs on efavirenz).

                           Mechanism of Action
                           
                              Efavirenz (EFV) is an NNRTI of HIV-1.
EFV activity is mediated predominantly by noncompetitive inhibition of HIV-1
reverse transcriptase (RT). HIV-2 RT and human cellular DNA polymerases α, β, γ, and δ are not inhibited by EFV. 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture
                           
                              The concentration of EFV inhibiting
replication of wild-type laboratory adapted strains and clinical isolates
in cell culture by 90-95% (EC90-95) ranged from 1.7
to 25 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs), and macrophage/monocyte cultures. EFV demonstrated antiviral activity
against clade B and most non-clade B isolates (subtypes A, AE, AG, C, D, F,
G, J, N), but had reduced antiviral activity against group O viruses. EFV
demonstrated additive antiviral activity without cytotoxicity against HIV-1
in cell culture when combined with the NNRTIs delavirdine (DLV) and nevirapine
(NVP), NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine [LAM], stavudine,
tenofovir, zalcitabine, zidovudine [ZDV]), PIs (amprenavir, indinavir [IDV],
lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), and the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide.
EFV demonstrated additive to antagonistic antiviral activity in cell culture
with atazanavir. EFV was not antagonistic with adefovir, used for the treatment
of hepatitis B virus infection, or ribavirin, used in combination with interferon
for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection.

                                    In cell culture, HIV-1 isolates with
reduced susceptibility to EFV (>380-fold increase in EC90 value)
emerged rapidly in the presence of drug. Genotypic characterization of these
viruses identified single amino acid substitutions L100I or V179D, double
substitutions L100I/V108I, and triple substitutions L100I/V179D/Y181C in
RT.

                                    Clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility
in cell culture to EFV have been obtained. One or more RT substitutions at
amino acid positions 98, 100, 101, 103, 106, 108, 188, 190, 225, and 227 were
observed in patients failing treatment with EFV in combination with IDV, or
with ZDV plus LAM. The mutation K103N was the most frequently observed. Long-term
resistance surveillance (average 52 weeks, range 4-106 weeks) analyzed 28
matching baseline and virologic failure isolates. Sixty-one percent (17/28)
of these failure isolates had decreased EFV susceptibility in cell culture
with a median 88-fold change in EFV susceptibility (EC50 value)
from reference. The most frequent NNRTI substitution to develop in these patient
isolates was K103N (54%). Other NNRTI substitutions that developed included
L100I (7%), K101E/Q/R (14%), V108I (11%), G190S/T/A (7%), P225H (18%), and
M230I/L (11%).

                              Cross-resistance among NNRTIs has been
observed. Clinical isolates previously characterized as EFV-resistant were
also phenotypically resistant in cell culture to DLV and NVP compared to baseline.
DLV- and/or NVP-resistant clinical viral isolates with NNRTI resistance-associated
substitutions (A98G, L100I, K101E/P, K103N/S, V106A, Y181X, Y188X, G190X,
P225H, F227L, or M230L) showed reduced susceptibility to EFV in cell culture.
Greater than 90% of NRTI-resistant clinical isolates tested in cell culture
retained susceptibility to EFV.
