                        Sensipar® is metabolized in part by the enzyme CYP3A4. Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, caused an approximate 2-fold increase in cinacalcet exposure. Dose adjustment of Sensipar® may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, itraconazole; see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS).
