                        Meperidine hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution and consideration should be given to starting with a reduced dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Drug-drug interactions may result in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma, or deathÂ if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of meperidine hydrochloride tablets.
