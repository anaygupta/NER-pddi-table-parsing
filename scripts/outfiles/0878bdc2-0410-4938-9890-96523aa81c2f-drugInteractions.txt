                           Antacids
                           
                              The extent of absorption of cefaclor extended-release tablets is diminished if magnesium or aluminum hydroxide-containing antacids are taken within 1 hour of administration; H2 blockers do not alter either the rate or the extent of absorption of cefaclor extended-release tablets.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Probenecid
                           
                              The renal excretion of cefaclor is inhibited by probenecid.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Warfarin
                           
                              There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time with or without clinical bleeding in patients receiving cefaclor and warfarin concomitantly. No specific studies have been performed to rule in or rule out this potential drug/drug interaction.
