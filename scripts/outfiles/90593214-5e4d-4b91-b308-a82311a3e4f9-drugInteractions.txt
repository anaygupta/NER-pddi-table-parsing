                        Bile acid sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and colestipol may interfere with the action of Ursodiol Tablets, USP by reducing its absorption. Aluminum-based antacids have been shown to adsorb bile acids in vitro and may be expected to interfere with Ursodiol Tablets, USP in the same manner as the bile acid sequestering agents. Estrogens, oral contraceptives, and clofibrate (and perhaps other lipid-lowering drugs) increase hepatic cholesterol secretion, and encourage cholesterol gallstone formation and hence may counteract the effectiveness of Ursodiol Tablets, USP.
