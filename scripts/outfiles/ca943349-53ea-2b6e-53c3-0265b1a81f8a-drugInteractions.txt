                        Concomitant use with metoclopramide, beta-blockers, or cholinomimetic and anticholinergic drugs is not recommended (7.1, 7.2, 7.3) 
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                      7.1 Metoclopramide 
                     
                        Due to the risk of additive extrapyramidal adverse reactions, the concomitant use of metoclopramide and rivastigmine tartrate is not recommended.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Cholinomimetic and Anticholinergic Medications
                     
                        Rivastigmine tartrate may increase the cholinergic effects of other cholinomimetic medications and may also interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (e.g., oxybutynin, tolterodine). Concomitant use of rivastigmine with medications having these pharmacologic effects is not recommended unless deemed clinically necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Beta-blockers 
                     
                        Additive bradycardic effects resulting in syncope may occur when rivastigmine tartrate is used concomitantly with beta-blockers, especially cardioselective beta-blockers (including atenolol). Concomitant use of rivastigmine tartrate with beta-blockers is not recommended.
