Drug Interactions:
Antidiabetic drug requirements, i.e., insulin, may be altered in association with the use of Diethylpropion hydrochloride and the concomitant dietary regimen.  Concurrent use with general anesthetics may result in arrhythmias.  The presser effects of diethylpropion and those of other drugs may be additive when the drugs are used concomitantly; conversely, diethylpropion may interfere with antihypertensive drugs, i.e., guanethidine, a-methyldopa.  Concurrent use of phenothiazines may antagonize the anorectic effect of diethylpropion.
