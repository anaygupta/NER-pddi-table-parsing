                  Parenteral dextrose solutions should be cautiously administered, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.
    Dextrose administration may cause vitamin B 
                           complex deficiency.
    Additives may be incompatible. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique, mix thoroughly and do not store. Dextrose should not be administered simultaneously with blood through the same infusion set because pseudoagglutination of red blood cells may occur.
