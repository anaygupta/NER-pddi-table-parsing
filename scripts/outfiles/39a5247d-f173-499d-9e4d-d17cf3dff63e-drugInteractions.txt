                     Nitrates
                  
                  Concomitant use of sildenafil tablets with nitrates in any form is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 
                  
                  
                     Ritonavir and other Potent CYP3A Inhibitors
                  
                  Concomitant use of sildenafil tablets with ritonavir and other potent CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                     Alpha-blockers.
                  In drug-drug interaction studies, sildenafil (25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg) and the alpha-blocker doxazosin (4 mg or 8 mg) were administered simultaneously to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) stabilized on doxazosin therapy. In these study populations, mean additional reductions of supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 7/7 mmHg, 9/5 mmHg, and 8/4 mmHg, respectively, were observed. Mean additional reductions of standing blood pressure of 6/6 mmHg, 11/4 mmHg, and 4/5 mmHg, respectively, were also observed. There were infrequent reports of patients who experienced symptomatic postural hypotension. These reports included dizziness and light-headedness, but not syncope. 
                  
                  
                     Amlodipine. 
                  
                  When sildenafil 100 mg oral was co-administered with amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg oral, to hypertensive patients, the mean additional reduction on supine blood pressure was 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic. 
                  
                  Monitor blood pressure when co-administering blood pressure lowering drugs with sildenafil tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
