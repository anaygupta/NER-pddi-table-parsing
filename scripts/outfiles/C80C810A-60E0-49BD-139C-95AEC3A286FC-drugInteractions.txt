Clinically Significant Drug Interactions:
The administration of local anesthetic solutions
containing epinephrine or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine
oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants may produce severe,
prolonged hypertension. Concurrent use of these agents should generally
be avoided. In situations when concurrent therapy is necessary, careful
patient monitoring is essential.Concurrent
administration of vasopressor drugs and of ergot-type oxytocic drugs
may cause severe, persistent hypertension or cerebrovascular accidents.Phenothiazines and butyrophenones may reduce or reverse
the pressor effect of epinephrine.The clinical
observation has been made that despite adequate sulfonamide therapy,
local infections have occurred in areas infiltrated with procaine
hydrochloride prior to diagnostic punctures and drainage procedures.
Therefore, NOVOCAIN should not be used in any condition in which a
sulfonamide drug is being employed since para-aminobenzoic acid inhibits
the action of the sulfonamide.
