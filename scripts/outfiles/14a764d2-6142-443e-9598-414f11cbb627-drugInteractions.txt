                  WARNINGS
Addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect. This effect can be minimized by reducing the prazosin dose to 1 mg to 2 mg three times a day, by introducing additional antihypertensive drugs cautiously and then by retitrating prazosin based on clinical response.
Concomitant administration of prazosin hydrochloride with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
