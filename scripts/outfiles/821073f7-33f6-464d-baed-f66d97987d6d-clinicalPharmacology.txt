                        In a multiple dose pharmacokinetic trial that included 5 male subjects with interdigital tinea pedis (range of diseased area, 42 - 140 cm2; mean, 93 cm2), ERTACZO cream, 2%, was topically applied every 12 hours for a total of 13 doses to the diseased skin (0.5 grams sertaconazole nitrate per 100 cm2). Sertaconazole concentrations in plasma measured by serial blood sampling for 72 hours after the thirteenth dose were below the limit of quantitation (2.5 ng/mL) of the analytical method used.

                              Mechanism of Action
                           :
 Sertaconazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. Ergosterol is a key component of fungal cell membranes and lack of this component leads to fungal cell injury by leakage of key constituents in the cytoplasm from the cell.
