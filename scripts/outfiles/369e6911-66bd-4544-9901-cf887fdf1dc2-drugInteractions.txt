                  Cyclophosphamide is a pro-drug that is activated by cytochrome P450s  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  An increase of the concentration of cytotoxic metabolites may occur with:
                  
                     Protease inhibitors: Concomitant use of protease inhibitors may increase the concentration of cytotoxic metabolites. Use of protease inhibitor-based regimens was found to be associated with a higher Incidence of infections and neutropenia in patients receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (CDE) than use of a Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor-based regimen.
                  
                  Combined or sequential use of cyclophosphamide and other agents with similar toxicities can potentiate  toxicities.
                  
                     Increased hematotoxicity and/or immunosuppression may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example:
                           ACE inhibitors: ACE inhibitors can cause leukopenia.
                           Natalizumab
                           Paclitaxel: Increased hematotoxicity has been reported when cyclophosphamide was administered after paclitaxel infusion.
                           Thiazide diuretics
                           Zidovudine
                        
                     
                     Increased cardiotoxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example:
                           Anthracyclines
                           Cytarabine
                           Pentostatin
                           Radiation therapy of the cardiac region
                           Trastuzumab
                        
                     
                     Increased pulmonary toxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example:
                           Amiodarone
                           G-CSF, GM-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor): Reports suggest an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy that includes cyclophosphamide and G-CSF or GMCSF.
                        
                     
                     Increased nephrotoxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example:
                           Amphotericin B
                           Indomethacin: Acute water intoxication has been reported with concomitant use of indomethacin
                        
                     
                     Increase in other toxicities:
                           Azathioprine: Increased risk of hepatotoxicity (liver necrosis)
                           Busulfan: Increased incidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease and mucositis has been reported.
                           Protease inhibitors: Increased incidence of mucositis
                        
                     
                     Increased risk of hemorrhagic cystitis may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and past or concomitant radiation treatment.
                  
                  Etanercept:  In patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis, the addition of etanercept to standard treatment, including cyclophosphamide, was associated with a higher incidence of non-cutaneous malignant solid tumors.
                  Metronidazole:  Acute encephalopathy has been reported in a patient receiving cyclophosphamide and metronidazole. Causal association is unclear.  In an animal study, the combination of cyclophosphamide with metronidazole was associated with increased cyclophosphamide toxicity.
                  Tamoxifen:  Concomitant use of tamoxifen and chemotherapy may increase the risk of thromboembolic complications.
                  Coumarins:  Both increased and decreased warfarin effect have been reported in patients receiving warfarin and cyclophosphamide.
                  Cyclosporine:  Lower serum concentrations of cyclosporine have been observed in patients receiving a combination of cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine than in patients receiving only cyclosporine. This interaction may result in an increased incidence of graft-versus-host disease.
                  Depolarizing muscle relaxants:  Cyclophosphamide treatment causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity. Prolonged apnea may occur with concurrent depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g., succinylcholine). If a patient has been treated with cyclophosphamide within 10 days of general anesthesia, alert the anesthesiologist.
