                  Benzodiazepines, including QUAZEPAM, produce additive CNS depressant effects when co-administered with ethanol or other CNS depressants (e.g. psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistamines). Downward dose adjustment of QUAZEPAM and/or concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary because of additive effects.
