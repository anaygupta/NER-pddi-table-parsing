                  Nystatin is an antifungal antibiotic which is both fungistatic 
and fungicidal in vitro against a wide variety of 
yeasts and yeast-like fungi. It probably acts by binding to sterols in the cell 
membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing 
leakage of intracellular components. Nystatin is the first well tolerated 
antifungal antibiotic of dependable efficacy for the treatment of cutaneous, 
oral and intestinal infections caused by Candida 
(Monilia) albicans and other Candida species. It 
exhibits no appreciable activity against bacteria.
                  Nystatin provides specific therapy for all localized forms of candidiasis. 
Symptomatic relief is rapid, often occurring within 24 to 72 hours after the 
initiation of treatment. Cure is effected both clinically and mycologically in 
most cases of localized candidiasis.
