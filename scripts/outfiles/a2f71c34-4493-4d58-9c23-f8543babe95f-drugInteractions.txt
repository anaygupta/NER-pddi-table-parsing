                  No drug-drug interaction studies involving triptorelin have been conducted.
                  Human pharmacokinetic data with triptorelin suggest that C-terminal fragments produced by tissue degradation are either degraded completely within tissues or are rapidly degraded further in plasma, or cleared by the kidneys. Therefore, hepatic microsomal enzymes are unlikely to be involved in triptorelin metabolism. However, in the absence of relevant data and as a precaution, hyperprolactinemic drugs should not be used concomitantly with triptorelin since hyperprolactinemia reduces the number of pituitary GnRH receptors.
