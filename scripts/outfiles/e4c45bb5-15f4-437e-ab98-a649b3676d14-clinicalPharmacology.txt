                     12.1  Mechanism of Action
                     
                        JUXTAPID directly binds and inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby preventing the assembly of apo B-containing lipoproteins in enterocytes and hepatocytes. This inhibits the synthesis of chylomicrons and VLDL. The inhibition of the synthesis of VLDL leads to reduced levels of plasma LDL-C.

                           Effects on QT Interval
                        
                        At a concentration 23 times the Cmax of the maximum recommended dose, lomitapide does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent.

                           Absorption
                        
                        Upon oral administration of a single 60-mg dose of JUXTAPID, the lomitapide tmax is around 6 hours in healthy volunteers. The absolute bioavailability of lomitapide is approximately 7%. Lomitapide pharmacokinetics is approximately dose-proportional for oral single doses from 10-100 mg.
                        
                           Distribution
                        
                        The mean lomitapide volume of distribution at steady state is 985-1292 liters. Lomitapide is 99.8% plasma-protein bound. 
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        Lomitapide is metabolized extensively by the liver. The metabolic pathways include oxidation, oxidative N-dealkylation, glucuronide conjugation, and piperidine ring opening. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 metabolizes lomitapide to its major metabolites, M1 and M3, as detected in plasma. The oxidative N-dealkylation pathway breaks the lomitapide molecule into M1 and M3. M1 is the moiety that retains the piperidine ring, whereas M3 retains the rest of the lomitapide molecule in vitro. CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 2C19 may metabolize lomitapide to a small extent to M1. M1 and M3 do not inhibit activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in vitro.
                        
                           Excretion
                        
                        In a mass-balance study, a mean of 59.5% and 33.4% of the dose was excreted in the urine and feces, respectively. In another mass-balance study, a mean of 52.9% and 35.1% of the dose was excreted in the urine and feces, respectively. Lomitapide was not detectable in urine samples. M1 is the major urinary metabolite. Lomitapide is the major component in the feces. The mean lomitapide terminal half-life is 39.7 hours.

                           Hepatic Impairment
                        
                        A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 60 mg lomitapide in healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function compared with patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) and moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, lomitapide AUC and Cmax were 164% and 361% higher, respectively, compared with healthy volunteers. In patients with mild hepatic impairment, lomitapide AUC and Cmax were 47% and 4% higher, respectively, compared with healthy volunteers. Lomitapide has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 10-15) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6),

                           Renal Impairment
                        
                        A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 60 mg lomitapide in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis compared with healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Healthy volunteers had estimated creatinine clearance >80 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Compared with healthy volunteers, lomitapide AUC0-inf and Cmax were 40% and 50% higher, respectively, in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis. Effects of mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment as well as end-stage renal disease not yet on dialysis on lomitapide exposure have not been studied [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

                        Lomitapide does not induce CYPs 1A2, 3A4, or 2B6. Lomitapide inhibits CYP3A4. Lomitapide does not inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 2E1. M1 and M3 do not induce CYPs 1A2, 3A4, or 2B6. M1 and M3 do not inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. Lomitapide is not a P-gp substrate. Lomitapide inhibits P-gp but does not inhibit breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).

                           CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                        
                        Lomitapide exposure increased 27-fold in the presence of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Thus, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and lomitapide is contraindicated. The effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on lomitapide exposure has not been studied. However, moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors will likely increase lomitapide exposure significantly based on the results of concomitant use of strong and weak CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and (7.2)]. Thus, concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and lomitapide is contraindicated. 
                        Interaction between weak CYP3A4 inhibitors and lomitapide has not been studied. Based on cross-studies comparisons, the lomitapide exposure approximately doubles in the presence of oral contraceptives, which are weak CYP3A4 inhibitors. Do not exceed 30 mg daily of JUXTAPID when used concomitantly with weak CYP3A4 inhibitors. [See Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].
