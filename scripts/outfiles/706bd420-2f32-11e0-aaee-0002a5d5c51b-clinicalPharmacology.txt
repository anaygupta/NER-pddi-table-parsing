                     12.1	Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Mechlorethamine, also known as nitrogen mustard, is an alkylating agent which inhibits rapidly proliferating cells.

                        Systemic exposure was undetectable after topical administration of VALCHLOR to patients.  Blood samples were analyzed from 16 and 15 patients following treatment with VALCHLOR (mechlorethamine gel 0.016%) and an identical formulation consisting of mechlorethamine 0.032% w/w, respectively.  For patients who received mechlorethamine 0.016%, samples were collected to measure mechlorethamine concentrations prior to dosing, on day 1, and at the first month visit. Following the topical administration of mechlorethamine 0.016%, there were no detectable plasma mechlorethamine concentrations observed in any of the patients. Patients who received mechlorethamine 0.032% had no measurable concentrations of mechlorethamine or half-mustard after 2, 4, or 6 months of treatment.
