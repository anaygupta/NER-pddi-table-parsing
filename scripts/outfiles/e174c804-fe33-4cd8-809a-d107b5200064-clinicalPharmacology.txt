Ferrous Fumarate (anhydrous)    191.1 mg Polysaccharide iron complex (PIC)    135.9 mg
Ferrous Fumarate: Provides about 62.5 mg of elemental iron per dose. Ferrous Fumarate is an anhydrous salt of a combination of ferrous iron and fumaric acid, containing 33% of iron per weight. The acute toxicity in experimental animals is low and Ferrous Fumarate is well tolerated clinically. As a ferrous salt, it is more efficiently absorbed in the duodenum. Iron absorption is maximal in the duodenum unlike Ferrous Sulfate, which must be protected against oxidation through coating. The IntegraTM Capsule is superior to enteric coated or sustained release preparations that are apt to pass beyond the duodenum and would therefore be poorly absorbed. Ferrous Fumarate contrasts very favorably with the availability of the 20% of elemental iron of ferrous sulfate, and the 13% of elemental iron of ferrous gluconate. Calculation of Dose should be in terms of elemental iron and three doses ranging from 50-100 mg of elemental iron is usually adequate.
Polysaccharide Iron Complex: Provides about 62.5 mg elemental iron, as a cell-contracted akaganèite. It is a product of ferric iron complexed to a low molecular weight polysaccharide. This polysaccharide is produced by the extensive hydrolysis of starch and is a dark brown powder, that dissolves in water to form a very dark brown solution, which is virtually odorless and tasteless.
All IntegraTM products include a unique patented source of iron, e.g. Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex (U.S. Patent No: 11/243,043 Pending). "An increase in tolerability is observed with the (patented formulation) and is believed to occur as the result of distributing the total iron content in the composition among compounds that provide iron to the patient's blood stream via two different mechanisms. The ferrous salts are readily absorbed in the upper gut, by direct dissolution and absorption of the ferrous iron by the bloodstream. However, the iron available from PIC is absorbed in the lower gut, via an active protein transport mechanism".
