                           Calcium supplements, antacids or oral medications containing
multivalent cations interfere with absorption of alendronate. (7.1)
                           Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation. (7.2, 7.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids
                     
                        Co-administration of BINOSTO and calcium,
antacids, or oral medications containing multivalent cations will
interfere with absorption of BINOSTO. Therefore, instruct patients
to wait at least one-half hour after taking BINOSTO before taking
any other oral medications.

                        In clinical studies, the incidence of upper
gastrointestinal adverse events was increased in patients receiving
concomitant therapy with daily doses of alendronate sodium greater
than 10 mg and aspirin-containing products.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory
Drugs (NSAIDs)
                     
                        BINOSTO
may be administered to patients taking NSAIDs. In a 3-year, controlled,
clinical study (n=2027) during which a majority of patients received
concomitant NSAIDs, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse
events was similar in patients taking alendronate sodium 5 or 10 mg/day
compared to those taking placebo. However, since NSAID use is associated
with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be used during concomitant
use with BINOSTO.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Levothyroxine
                     
                        The bioavailability of alendronate was slightly
decreased when BINOSTO and levothyroxine were co-administered to healthy
subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
