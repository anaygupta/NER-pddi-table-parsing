                        Tipranavir is an antiviral drug [
                              see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)

The
effect of APTIVUS/ritonavir on the QTcF interval was measured in a
study in which 81 healthy subjects received the following treatments
twice daily for 2.5 days: APTIVUS/ritonavir (500/200 mg), APTIVUS/ritonavir
at a supra-therapeutic dose (750/200 mg), and placebo/ritonavir (-/200
mg). After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF
change was 3.2 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 5.6 ms) for the 500/200 mg
dose and 8.3 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 10.9 ms) for the supra-therapeutic
750/200 mg dose.
                        
                           
                              Antiviral Activity in vivo
                           
                           
The median
Inhibitory Quotient (IQ) determined from 264 treatment-experienced
adult patients was about 80 (inter-quartile range: 31-226), from the
controlled clinical trials 1182.12 and 1182.48. The IQ is defined
as the tipranavir trough concentration divided by the viral EC50 value, corrected for protein binding. There was a
relationship between the proportion of patients with a ≥1 log10 reduction of viral load from baseline at week 48 and
their IQ value. Among the 198 patients receiving APTIVUS/ritonavir
with no new enfuvirtide use (e.g., new enfuvirtide, defined as initiation
of enfuvirtide for the first time), the response rate was 23% in those
with an IQ value <80 and 59% in those with an IQ value ≥80. Among
the 66 patients receiving APTIVUS/ritonavir with new enfuvirtide,
the response rates in patients with an IQ value <80 versus those
with an IQ value ≥80 were 55% and 71%, respectively. These IQ groups
are derived from a select population and are not meant to represent
clinical breakpoints.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3  Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        In order to achieve effective tipranavir plasma concentrations and
a twice-daily dosing regimen, co-administration of APTIVUS with ritonavir
is essential [
                              see Dosage and Administration (2)
                              
                           ]. Ritonavir inhibits
hepatic cytochrome P450 3A (CYP 3A), the intestinal P-gp efflux pump
and possibly intestinal CYP 3A. In a dose-ranging evaluation in 113
HIV-1 negative male and female volunteers, there was a 29-fold increase
in the geometric mean morning steady-state trough plasma concentrations
of tipranavir following APTIVUS co-administered with low-dose ritonavir
(500/200 mg twice daily) compared to APTIVUS 500 mg twice daily without
ritonavir. In adults the mean systemic ritonavir concentration when
200 mg of ritonavir was given with 500 mg of APTIVUS was similar to
the concentrations observed when 100 mg was given with the other protease
inhibitors.
                        Figure 1 displays
mean plasma concentrations of tipranavir and ritonavir at steady state
for 30 HIV-1 infected adult patients dosed with 500/200 mg tipranavir/ritonavir

and Bioavailability
                              
                           
                           
                              Absorption of tipranavir in humans is limited, although
no absolute quantification of absorption is available. Tipranavir
is a P-gp substrate, a weak P-gp inhibitor, and appears to be a potent
P-gp inducer as well. 
                                    In vivo
                                  data suggest that tipranavir/ritonavir, at the dose of 500/200 mg,
is a P-gp inhibitor after the first dose and induction of P-gp occurs
over time. Tipranavir trough concentrations at steady-state are about
70% lower than those on Day 1, presumably due to intestinal P-gp induction.
Steady state is attained in most subjects after 7-10 days of dosing.
                              Dosing APTIVUS 500 mg with 200 mg ritonavir
capsules twice daily for greater than 2 weeks and without meal restriction
produced the pharmacokinetic parameters for male and female HIV-1
positive patients presented in Table 5.

                              Tipranavir
is extensively bound to plasma proteins (>99.9%). It binds to both
human serum albumin and α-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean fraction of
tipranavir (dosed without ritonavir) unbound in plasma was similar
in clinical samples from healthy volunteers and HIV-1 positive patients.
Total plasma tipranavir concentrations for these samples ranged from
9 to 82 μM. The unbound fraction of tipranavir appeared to be independent
of total drug concentration over this concentration range.
                              No studies have been conducted to determine
the distribution of tipranavir into human cerebrospinal fluid or semen.

                                    In vitro
                                  metabolism studies with human liver
microsomes indicated that CYP 3A4 is the predominant CYP enzyme involved
in tipranavir metabolism.
                              The
oral clearance of tipranavir decreased after the addition of ritonavir,
which may represent diminished first-pass clearance of the drug at
the gastrointestinal tract as well as the liver.
                              The metabolism of tipranavir in the presence of 200
mg ritonavir is minimal. Administration of 14C-tipranavir to subjects that received APTIVUS/ritonavir 500/200
mg dosed to steady-state demonstrated that unchanged tipranavir accounted
for 98.4% or greater of the total plasma radioactivity circulating
at 3, 8, or 12 hours after dosing. Only a few metabolites were found
in plasma, and all were at trace levels (0.2% or less of the plasma
radioactivity). In feces, unchanged tipranavir represented the majority
of fecal radioactivity (79.9% of fecal radioactivity). The most abundant
fecal metabolite, at 4.9% of fecal radioactivity (3.2% of dose), was
a hydroxyl metabolite of tipranavir. In urine, unchanged tipranavir
was found in trace amounts (0.5% of urine radioactivity). The most
abundant urinary metabolite, at 11.0% of urine radioactivity (0.5%
of dose) was a glucuronide conjugate of tipranavir.

of 14C-tipranavir to subjects (n=8) that
received APTIVUS/ritonavir 500/200 mg dosed to steady-state demonstrated
that most radioactivity (median 82.3%) was excreted in feces, while
only a median of 4.4% of the radioactive dose administered was recovered
in urine. In addition, most radioactivity (56%) was excreted between
24 and 96 hours after dosing. The effective mean elimination half-life
of tipranavir/ritonavir in healthy volunteers (n=67) and HIV-1 infected
adult patients (n=120) was approximately 4.8 and 6.0 hours, respectively,
at steady state following a dose of 500/200 mg twice daily with a
light meal.

APTIVUS pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients
with renal dysfunction. However, since the renal clearance of tipranavir
is negligible, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected
in patients with renal insufficiency.

In a study comparing 9 HIV-1 negative patients with mild
(Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment to 9 HIV-1 negative controls,
the single and multiple dose plasma concentrations of tipranavir and
ritonavir were increased in patients with hepatic impairment, but
were within the range observed in clinical trials. No dosing adjustment
is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment.

Class B) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the

in Table 6.

                              Drug interaction studies were performed with APTIVUS
capsules co-administered with ritonavir, and other drugs likely to
be co-administered and some drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic
interactions. The effects of co-administration of APTIVUS with 200
mg ritonavir on the AUC, Cmax, and Cmin of tipranavir or the co-administered drug, are summarized
in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. For information regarding clinical

Tipranavir (TPV) is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor
that inhibits the virus-specific processing of the viral Gag and Gag-Pol
polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of
mature virions.
                        
                           
                              Antiviral Activity
                           
                           
Tipranavir inhibits
the replication of laboratory strains of HIV-1 and clinical isolates
in acute models of T-cell infection, with 50% effective concentrations
(EC50) ranging from 0.03 to 0.07 μM (18-42
ng/mL). Tipranavir demonstrates antiviral activity in cell culture
against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M non-clade B isolates (A, C,
D, F, G, H, CRF01 AE, CRF02 AG, CRF12 BF). Group O and HIV-2 isolates
have reduced susceptibility in cell culture to tipranavir with EC50 values ranging from 0.164 -1 μM and 0.233-0.522 μM,
respectively. When used with other antiretroviral agents in cell culture,
the combination of tipranavir was additive to antagonistic with other
protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir,
nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir) and generally additive with
the NNRTIs (delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine) and the NRTIs
(abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir,
and zidovudine). Tipranavir was synergistic with the HIV-1 fusion
inhibitor enfuvirtide. There was no antagonism of the cell culture
combinations of tipranavir with either adefovir or ribavirin, used
in the treatment of viral hepatitis.

                              In cell culture:
                           
                           
 HIV-1 isolates with a decreased susceptibility to tipranavir have
been selected in cell culture and obtained from patients treated with
APTIVUS/ritonavir (TPV/ritonavir). After 9 months of culture in TPV-containing
media, HIV-1 isolates with 87-fold reduced susceptibility to tipranavir
were selected in cell culture; these contained 10 protease substitutions
that developed in the following order: L33F, I84V, K45I, I13V, V32I,
V82L, M36I, A71V, L10F, and I54V/T. Changes in the Gag polyprotein
CA/P2 cleavage site were also observed following drug selection. Experiments
with site-directed mutants of HIV-1 showed that the presence of 6
substitutions in the protease coding sequence (I13V, V32I, L33F, K45I,
V82L, I84V) conferred >10-fold reduced susceptibility to tipranavir.
                        
                           
                              Clinical Studies of
Treatment-Experienced Patients:
                           
                           
In
controlled clinical trials 1182.12 and 1182.48, multiple protease
inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 isolates from 59 treatment-experienced adult
patients who received APTIVUS/ritonavir and experienced virologic
rebound developed amino acid substitutions that were associated with
resistance to tipranavir. The most common amino acid substitutions
that developed on 500/200 mg APTIVUS/ritonavir in greater than 20%
of APTIVUS/ritonavir virologic failure isolates were L33V/I/F, V82T,
and I84V. Other substitutions that developed in 10 to 20% of APTIVUS/ritonavir
virologic failure isolates included L10V/I/S, I13V, E35D/G/N, I47V,
I54A/M/V, K55R, V82L, and L89V/M. Evolution at protease gag polyprotein
cleavage sites was also observed. Among 28 pediatric patients in clinical
trial 1182.14 who experienced virologic failure or non-response, the
emergent protease amino acid codon substitutions were similar to those
observed in adult virologic failure isolates.
                        In clinical trials 1182.12 and 1182.48 tipranavir resistance
was detected at virologic rebound after an average of 38 weeks of
APTIVUS/ritonavir treatment with a median 14-fold decrease in tipranavir
susceptibility. Similarly, reduced tipranavir susceptibility was associated
with emergent mutations in pediatric patient isolates.
                        
                           
                              Cross-resistance
                           
                           
Cross-resistance among protease inhibitors has
been observed. Tipranavir had <4-fold decreased susceptibility
against 90% (94/105) of HIV-1 clinical isolates resistant to amprenavir,
atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir.
Tipranavir-resistant viruses which emerged in cell culture from wild-type
HIV-1 had decreased susceptibility to the protease inhibitors amprenavir,
atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir but remained
sensitive to saquinavir.
                        
                           
                              Baseline Genotype and Virologic Outcome Analyses
                           
                           
Genotypic and/or phenotypic analysis of baseline
virus may aid in determining tipranavir susceptibility before initiation
of APTIVUS/ritonavir therapy. Several analyses were conducted to evaluate
the impact of specific substitutions and combination of substitutions
on virologic outcome. Both the type and number of baseline protease
inhibitor substitutions as well as use of additional active agents
(e.g., enfuvirtide) affected APTIVUS/ritonavir response rates in controlled
clinical trials 1182.12 and 1182.48 through Week 48 of treatment.
                        Regression analyses of baseline and/or
on-treatment HIV-1 genotypes from 860 treatment-experienced patients
in Phase 2 and 3 trials demonstrated that amino acid substitutions
at 16 codons in the HIV-1 protease coding sequence were associated
with reduced virologic responses and/or reduced tipranavir susceptibility:
L10V, I13V, K20M/R/V, L33F, E35G, M36I, K43T, M46L, I47V, I54A/M/V,
Q58E, H69K, T74P, V82L/T, N83D or I84V.
                        As-treated analyses were also conducted to assess virologic
outcome by the number of primary protease inhibitor substitutions
present at baseline. Response rates were reduced if five or more protease
inhibitor-associated substitutions were present at baseline and subjects
did not receive concomitant new enfuvirtide with APTIVUS/ritonavir.
See Table 9.
                        


                        


The median change from baseline
in plasma HIV-1 RNA at weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 was evaluated
by the number of baseline primary protease inhibitor resistance associated
substitutions (1-4 or ≥5) in subjects who received APTIVUS/ritonavir
with or without new enfuvirtide. The following observations were made:
                        
                           Approximately 1.5 log10 decrease
in HIV-1 RNA at early time points (Week 2) regardless of the number
of baseline primary protease inhibitor resistance associated substitutions
(1-4 or 5+).
                           Subjects with 5 or more primary protease inhibitor resistance
associated substitutions in their HIV-1 at baseline who received APTIVUS/ritonavir
without new enfuvirtide (n=303) began to lose their antiviral response
after Week 4.
                           Early HIV-1 RNA decreases (1.5-2 log10) were sustained through Week 48 in subjects with 5 or more primary
protease inhibitor resistance associated substitutions at baseline
who received new enfuvirtide with APTIVUS/ritonavir (n=74).
                        
                        
                           
                              Baseline Phenotype
and Virologic Outcome Analyses
                           
                           
APTIVUS/ritonavir
response rates were also assessed by baseline tipranavir phenotype.
Relationships between baseline phenotypic susceptibility to tipranavir,
mutations at protease amino acid codons 33, 82, 84 and 90, tipranavir
resistance-associated mutations, and response to APTIVUS/ritonavir
therapy at Week-48 are summarized in Tables 10 and 11. These baseline
phenotype groups are not meant to represent clinical susceptibility
breakpoints for APTIVUS/ritonavir because the data are based on the
select 1182.12 and 1182.48 patient population. The data are provided
to give clinicians information on the likelihood of virologic success
based on pre-treatment susceptibility to APTIVUS/ritonavir in protease
inhibitor-experienced patients.
                        



                        


Analyses of pediatric clinical trial
1182.14 also demonstrated that response to therapy was influenced
by the number of baseline protease inhibitor mutations present.
