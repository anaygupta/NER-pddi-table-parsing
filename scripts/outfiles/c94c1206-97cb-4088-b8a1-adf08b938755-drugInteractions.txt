                           Co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase serum levels of cinacalcet. Dose adjustment and monitoring of iPTH serum phosphorous and serum calcium may be required. (7.1)
                           Cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. Dose adjustments may be required for concomitant medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6. (7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                     
                        Cinacalcet is partially metabolized by CYP3A4. Dose adjustment of Sensipar may be required if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole). The iPTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 CYP2D6 Substrates
                     
                        Cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. Dose adjustments may be required for concomitant medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., desipramine, metoprolol, and carvedilol) and particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., flecainide and most tricyclic antidepressants) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
