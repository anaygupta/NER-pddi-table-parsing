                  Parenteral administration of tetracaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane and prevents initiation and transmission of nerve impulses thereby effecting local anesthesia.

                  The onset of action is rapid, and the duration is prolonged (up to two or three hours or longer of surgical anesthesia).

                  Tetracaine hydrochloride is detoxified by plasma esterases to aminobenzoic acid and diethylaminoethanol.
