                  Atropine is commonly classified as an anticholinergic or antiparasympathetic (parasympatholytic)
drug. More precisely, however, it is termed an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the
muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and other choline esters.
Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by
postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous
acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of
atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the
concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using
anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors
antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine
(i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic
nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses
to injected (exogenous) choline esters.
Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of
stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic
tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged
effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary
body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in
clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and
higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and
(sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of
bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or
repeated doses may depress respiration.
Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole.
The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters,
anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by
stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal
activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate
may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may
cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm.
Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and
abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself,
atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic
doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural
hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure.
Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the “blush” area
(atropine flush), and may cause atropine “fever” due to suppression of sweat gland activity in
infants and small children.
Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the
body. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to
50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk.
Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation.
Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is
present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na+) and chloride
(Cl¯ ) ions.
