                        Daptomycin is an antibacterial drug [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)

                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Based on animal models of infection, the antimicrobial activity of daptomycin appears to correlate with the AUC/MIC (area under the concentration-time curve/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratio for certain pathogens, including S. aureus. The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with Daptomycin for Injection.

                              Daptomycin for Injection Administered over a 30-Minute Period
                           
                        
                        The mean and standard deviation (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters of daptomycin at steady-state following intravenous (IV) administration of Daptomycin for Injection over a 30-minute period at 4 to 12 mg/kg q24h to healthy young adults are summarized in Table 7.
                        


                        


Daptomycin pharmacokinetics were generally linear and time-independent at Daptomycin for Injection doses of 4 to 12 mg/kg q24h administered by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for up to 14 days. Steady-state trough concentrations were achieved by the third daily dose. The mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations attained following the administration of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg q24h were 5.9 (1.6), 6.7 (1.6), 10.3 (5.5), 12.9 (2.9), and 13.7 (5.2) mcg/mL, respectively.
                        
                           
                              Daptomycin for Injection Administered over a 2-Minute Period
                           
                        
                        Following IV administration of Daptomycin for Injection over a 2-minute period to healthy volunteers at doses of 4 mg/kg (N=8) and 6 mg/kg (N=12), the mean (SD) steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) values were 475 (71) and 701 (82) mcg•h/mL, respectively. Values for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at the end of the 2-minute period could not be determined adequately in this study. However, using pharmacokinetic parameters from 14 healthy volunteers who received a single dose of Daptomycin for Injection 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 30-minute period in a separate study, steady-state Cmax values were simulated for Daptomycin for Injection 4 and 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 2-minute period. The simulated mean (SD) steady-state Cmax values were 77.7 (8.1) and 116.6 (12.2) mcg/mL, respectively.

                        Daptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in a concentration-independent manner. The overall mean binding ranges from 90 to 93%.
                        In clinical studies, mean serum protein binding in subjects with creatinine clearance (CLCR) ≥30 mL/min was comparable to that observed in healthy subjects with normal renal function. However, there was a trend toward decreasing serum protein binding among subjects with CLCR <30 mL/min (88%), including those receiving hemodialysis (86%) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (84%). The protein binding of daptomycin in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was similar to that in healthy adult subjects.
                        The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately 0.1 L/kg and was independent of dose.
                        
                           
                              Metabolism
                           
                        
                        In in vitro studies, daptomycin was not metabolized by human liver microsomes.
                        In 5 healthy adults after infusion of radiolabeled 14C-daptomycin, the plasma total radioactivity was similar to the concentration determined by microbiological assay. Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as determined by the difference between total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active concentrations. In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma on Day 1 following the administration of Daptomycin for Injection at 6 mg/kg to subjects. Minor amounts of three oxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine. The site of metabolism has not been identified.

                        Daptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys. In a mass balance study of 5 healthy subjects using radiolabeled daptomycin, approximately 78% of the administered dose was recovered from urine based on total radioactivity (approximately 52% of the dose based on microbiologically active concentrations), and 5.7% of the administered dose was recovered from feces (collected for up to 9 days) based on total radioactivity.

                        Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for infected patients (complicated skin and skin structure infections [cSSSI] and S. aureus bacteremia) and noninfected subjects with various degrees of renal function (Table 8). Total plasma clearance (CLT), elimination half-life (t1/2), and volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) in patients with cSSSI were similar to those in patients with S. aureus bacteremia. Following administration of Daptomycin for Injection 4 mg/kg q24h, by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean CLT was 9%, 22%, and 46% lower among subjects and patients with mild (CLCR 50–80 mL/min), moderate (CLCR 30–<50 mL/min), and severe (CLCR <30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, than in those with normal renal function (CLCR >80 mL/min). The mean steady-state systemic exposure (AUC), t1/2, and Vss increased with decreasing renal function, although the mean AUC for patients with CLCR 30–80 mL/min was not markedly different from the mean AUC for patients with normal renal function. The mean AUC for patients with CLCR <30 mL/min and for patients on dialysis (CAPD and hemodialysis dosed post-dialysis) was approximately 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than for patients with normal renal function. The mean Cmax ranged from 60 to 70 mcg/mL in patients with CLCR ≥30 mL/min, while the mean Cmax for patients with CLCR <30 mL/min ranged from 41 to 58 mcg/mL. After administration of Daptomycin for Injection 6 mg/kg q24h, by IV infusion over a 30-minute period the mean Cmax ranged from 80 to 114 mcg/mL in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and was similar to that of patients with normal renal function.
                        


                        


Because renal excretion is the primary route of elimination, adjustment of Daptomycin for Injection dosage interval is necessary in patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 mL/min) [see

                        The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 10 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and compared with those in healthy volunteers (N=9) matched for gender, age, and weight. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were not altered in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is warranted when Daptomycin for Injection is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been evaluated.

                        No clinically significant gender-related differences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed. No dosage adjustment is warranted based on gender when Daptomycin for Injection is administered.

                        The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 12 healthy elderly subjects (≥75 years of age) and 11 healthy young controls (18 to 30 years of age). Following administration of a single 4 mg/kg dose of Daptomycin for Injection by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean total clearance of daptomycin was approximately 35% lower and the mean AUC0-∞ was approximately 58% higher in elderly subjects than in healthy young subjects. There were no differences in Cmax [see

                        The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 6 moderately obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] 25 to 39.9 kg/m2) and 6 extremely obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m2) subjects and controls matched for age, gender, and renal function. Following administration of Daptomycin for Injection by IV infusion over a 30-minute period as a single 4 mg/kg IV dose based on total body weight, the total plasma clearance of daptomycin normalized to total body weight was approximately 15% lower in moderately obese subjects and 23% lower in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The AUC0-∞ of daptomycin was approximately 30% higher in moderately obese subjects and 31% higher in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The differences were most likely due to differences in the renal clearance of daptomycin. No adjustment of Daptomycin for Injection dosage is warranted in obese patients.

                           In vitro studies with human hepatocytes indicate that daptomycin does not inhibit or induce the activities of the following human cytochrome P450 isoforms: 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. It is unlikely that daptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by the P450 system.

The mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ of tobramycin were 10.7% and 6.6% lower, respectively, when tobramycin was coadministered with Daptomycin for Injection. These differences were not statistically significant. The interaction between daptomycin and tobramycin with a clinical dose of Daptomycin for Injection is unknown.

                        Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria.
                        Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro. This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known.
                        
                           
                              Mechanism of Action
                           
                        
                        The mechanism of action of daptomycin is distinct from that of any other antibacterial. Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death.
                        
                           
                              Mechanism of Resistance
                           
                        
                        The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin.

                        The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received Daptomycin for Injection at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial.

                           In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, β-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin-resistant isolates).

At least 90% of the following Gram-positive bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for daptomycin versus the bacterial genus (Table 9). However, the efficacy of Daptomycin for Injection in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

                        When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility tests for antimicrobial drug products used in resident hospitals to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug product for treatment.

                        Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized broth test method2,3 with the broth adjusted to a calcium content of 50 mg/L. The use of the agar dilution method is not recommended with daptomycin3. The MICs should be interpreted according to the criteria listed in Table 9.
                        


                        


A report of “Susceptible” indicates that the antimicrobial is likely to inhibit the growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentration at the infection site necessary to inhibit growth of the pathogen.

                        Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters have not been shown to provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to daptomycin. The use of the disk diffusion method is not recommended with daptomycin3,4.

                        Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test2,3. Standard daptomycin powder should provide the range of MIC values noted in Table 10.
