                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        VIEKIRA PAK combines three direct-acting hepatitis C virus antiviral agents with distinct mechanisms of action [see Microbiology (12.4)].
                        Ritonavir is not active against HCV. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that increases peak and trough plasma drug concentrations of paritaprevir and overall drug exposure (i.e., area under the curve).

                           Cardiac Electrophysiology
                        
                        The effect of a combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and dasabuvir on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double blind, placebo and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) 4-way crossover thorough QT study in 60 healthy subjects. At concentrations approximately 6, 1.8 and 2 times the therapeutic concentrations of paritaprevir, ombitasvir, and dasabuvir, the combination did not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        
                           Absorption
                        
                        Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir were absorbed after oral administration with mean Tmax of approximately 4 to 5 hours. While ombitasvir and dasabuvir exposures increased in a dose proportional manner, paritaprevir and ritonavir exposures increased in a more than dose proportional manner. Accumulation is minimal for ombitasvir and dasabuvir and approximately 1.5- to 2-fold for ritonavir and paritaprevir. Steady state exposures are achieved after approximately 12 days of dosing.
                        The absolute bioavailability of dasabuvir estimated to be approximately 70%. The absolute bioavailability of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir was not evaluated.
                        Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the median steady-state AUC0-24 for ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir were 1000, 2220 and 6180 ng•hr/mL, respectively, and the median steady-state AUC0-12 for dasabuvir was 3240 ng•hr/mL when VIEKIRA PAK was administered to HCV-infected subjects. Median steady-state Cmax for ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir were 68, 262, 682 and 667 ng/mL, respectively, when VIEKIRA PAK was administered to HCV-infected subjects.
                        
                           Effects of Food on Oral Absorption
                        
                        Relative to fasting conditions, administration of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and dasabuvir with a moderate fat meal (approximately 600 Kcal, 20-30% calories from fat) increased the mean AUC by 82%, 211%, 49%, and 30%, respectively.
                        Relative to fasting conditions, administration of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and dasabuvir with a high fat meal (approximately 900 Kcal, 60% calories from fat) increased the mean AUC by 76%, 180%, 44%, and 22%, respectively.
                        Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and dasabuvir should always be administered with a meal.

                           Ombitasvir: Following a single dose administration of 14C-ombitasvir, approximately 90.2% of the radioactivity was recovered in feces with limited radioactivity (1.91%) in urine; unchanged ombitasvir accounted for 87.8% of the radioactivity in the feces and 0.03% in the urine. The mean elimination half-life of ombitasvir was approximately 21 to 25 hours. 
                        
                           Paritaprevir: Following a single dose administration of 14C-paritaprevir co-dosed with 100 mg of ritonavir, approximately 88% of the radioactivity was recovered in feces with limited radioactivity (8.8%) in urine; unchanged paritaprevir accounted for 1.1% of the radioactivity in the feces and 0.05% in the urine.  The mean plasma half-life of paritaprevir was approximately 5.5 hours.
                        
                           Ritonavir: Following dosing of ritonavir with ombitasvir and  paritaprevir, mean plasma half-life of ritonavir was approximately 4 hours. Following a single 600 mg dose of 14C-ritonavir oral solution, 86.4% of the radioactivity was recovered in the feces and 11.3% of the dose was excreted in the urine.

                        The single dose pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir were evaluated in non-HCV infected subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Category A; score of 5-6), moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Category B, score of 7-9) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Category C, score of 10-15).
                        Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir AUC values decreased  by 8%, 29% and 34%,  respectively, and dasabuvir AUC values increased by 17%  in subjects with mild hepatic impairment.
                        Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, ombitasvir, ritonavir and dasabuvir AUC values decreased by 30%, 30% and 16%, respectively, and paritaprevir AUC values increased by 62% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.
                        Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir AUC values increased  by 945%, 13%, and 325% respectively, and ombitasvir AUC values decreased by 54% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment.
                        No dosage adjustment of VIEKIRA PAK is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). VIEKIRA PAK is not recommended in HCV-infected patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). VIEKIRA PAK is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

                        Overall, changes in exposure of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir in non-HCV infected subjects with mild-, moderate- and severe renal impairment are not expected to be clinically relevant.  Pharmacokinetic data are not available on the use of VIEKIRA PAK in non-HCV infected subjects with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).
                        Relative to subjects with normal renal function, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir AUC values increased by 19%, 42% and 21%, respectively, while ombitasvir AUC values were unchanged in subjects with mild renal impairment.
                        Relative to subjects with normal renal function, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir AUC values increased by 33%, 80% and 37%, respectively, while ombitasvir AUC values were unchanged in subjects with moderate renal impairment.
                        Relative to subjects with normal renal function, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir AUC values increased by 45%, 114% and 50%, respectively, while ombitasvir AUC values were unchanged in subjects with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

                           Mechanism of Action 
                        
                        VIEKIRA PAK combines three direct-acting antiviral agents with distinct mechanisms of action and non-overlapping resistance profiles to target HCV at multiple steps in the viral lifecycle.
                        
                           Ombitasvir
                        
                        Ombitasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral RNA replication and virion assembly. The mechanism of action of ombitasvir has been characterized based on cell culture antiviral activity and drug resistance mapping studies.
                        
                           Paritaprevir
                        
                        Paritaprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease which is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and is essential for viral replication. In a biochemical assay, paritaprevir inhibited the proteolytic activity of recombinant HCV genotype 1a and 1b NS3/4A protease enzymes with IC50 values of 0.18 nM and 0.43 nM, respectively. Paritaprevir inhibited the activity of NS3/4A enzymes from single isolates of genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a, and 4a with IC50 values of 2.4 nM, 6.3 nM, 14.5 nM, and 0.16 nM, respectively.
                        
                           Dasabuvir
                        
                        Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the NS5B gene, which is essential for replication of the viral genome. In a biochemical assay, dasabuvir inhibited a panel of genotype 1a and 1b NS5B polymerases with median IC50 values of 2.8 nM (range 2.4 nM to 4.2 nM; n = 3) and 3.7 nM (range 2.2 nM to 10.7 nM; n = 4), respectively. Based on drug resistance mapping studies of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b, dasabuvir targets the palm domain of the NS5B polymerase, and is therefore referred to as a non-nucleoside NS5B-palm polymerase inhibitor. Dasabuvir had reduced activity in biochemical assays against NS5B polymerases from HCV genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a and 4a (IC50 values ranging from 900 nM to >20 μM). 
                        
                           Antiviral Activity
                        
                        
                           Ombitasvir
                        
                        The EC50 values of ombitasvir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays were 14.1 pM and 5 pM, respectively. The median EC50 values of ombitasvir against HCV replicons containing NS5A genes from a panel of genotype 1a and 1b isolates from treatment-naïve subjects were 0.68 pM (range 0.35 to 0.88 pM; n = 11) and 0.94 pM (range 0.74 to 1.5 pM; n = 11), respectively. Ombitasvir had EC50 values of 12 pM, 4.3 pM, 19 pM, 1.7 pM, 3.2 pM, and 366 pM against chimeric replicons constructed with NS5A from single isolates representing genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a, and 6a, respectively.
                        
                           Paritaprevir
                        
                        The EC50 values of paritaprevir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in the HCV replicon cell culture assay were 1.0 nM and 0.21 nM, respectively. The median EC50 values of paritaprevir against HCV replicons containing NS3 genes from a panel of genotype 1a and 1b isolates from treatment-naïve subjects were 0.68 nM (range 0.43 nM to 1.87 nM; n = 11) and 0.06 nM (range 0.03 nM to 0.09 nM; n = 9), respectively. Paritaprevir had an EC50 value of 5.3 nM against the HCV genotype 2a-JFH-1 replicon cell line, and EC50 values of 19 nM, 0.09 nM, and 0.68 nM against replicon cell lines containing NS3 from a single isolate each of genotype 3a, 4a, and 6a, respectively.
                        In HCV replicon cell culture assays, ritonavir did not exhibit a direct antiviral effect and the presence of ritonavir did not affect the antiviral activity of paritaprevir.
                        
                           Dasabuvir
                        
                        The EC50 values of dasabuvir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays were 7.7 nM and 1.8 nM, respectively. The median EC50 values of dasabuvir against HCV replicons containing NS5B genes from a panel of genotype 1a and 1b isolates from treatment-naïve subjects were 0.6 nM (range 0.4 nM to 2.1 nM; n = 11) and 0.3 nM (range 0.2 nM to 2 nM; n = 10), respectively.
                        
                           Combination Antiviral Activity
                        
                        Evaluation of pairwise combinations of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, dasabuvir and ribavirin in HCV genotype 1 replicon cell culture assays showed no evidence of antagonism in antiviral activity.

                        Exposure of HCV genotype 1a and 1b replicons to ombitasvir, paritaprevir or dasabuvir resulted in the emergence of drug resistant replicons carrying amino acid substitutions in NS5A, NS3, or NS5B, respectively. Amino acid substitutions in NS5A, NS3, or NS5B selected in cell culture or identified in Phase 2b and 3 clinical trials were phenotypically characterized in genotype 1a or 1b replicons.
                        For ombitasvir, in HCV genotype 1a replicons single NS5A substitutions M28T/V, Q30E/R, L31V, H58D, and Y93C/H/L/N reduced ombitasvir antiviral activity by 58- to 67,000-fold. In genotype 1b replicons, single NS5A substitutions L28T, L31F/V, and Y93H reduced ombitasvir antiviral activity by 8- to 661-fold.   In general, combinations of ombitasvir resistance-associated substitutions in HCV genotype 1a or 1b replicons further reduced ombitasvir antiviral activity.
                        For paritaprevir, in HCV genotype 1a replicons single NS3 substitutions F43L, R155G/K/S, A156T, and D168A/E/F/H/N/V/Y reduced paritaprevir antiviral activity by 7- to 219-fold. An NS3 Q80K substitution in a genotype 1a replicon reduced paritaprevir antiviral activity by 3-fold.  Combinations of V36M, Y56H, or E357K with R155K or D168 substitutions reduced the activity of paritaprevir by an additional 2- to 7-fold relative to the single R155K or D168 substitutions in genotype 1a replicons. In genotype 1b replicons single NS3 substitutions A156T and D168A/H/V reduced paritaprevir antiviral activity by 7- to 159-fold. The combination of Y56H with D168 substitutions reduced the activity of paritaprevir by an additional 16- to 26-fold relative to the single D168 substitutions in genotype 1b replicons.
                        For dasabuvir, in HCV genotype 1a replicons single NS5B substitutions C316Y, M414I/T, E446K/Q, Y448C/H, A553T, G554S, S556G/R, and Y561H reduced dasabuvir antiviral activity by 8- to 1,472-fold. In genotype 1b replicons, single NS5B substitutions C316H/N/Y,  S368T, N411S, M414I/T, Y448C/H, A553V, S556G and D559G reduced dasabuvir antiviral activity by 5- to 1,569-fold.
                        
                           In Clinical Studies
                        
                        In a pooled analysis of subjects treated with regimens containing ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin (for 12 or 24 weeks) in Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials, resistance analyses were conducted for 64 subjects who experienced virologic failure (20 with on-treatment virologic failure, 44 with post-treatment relapse). Treatment-emergent substitutions observed in the viral populations of these subjects are shown in Table 8. Treatment-emergent substitutions were detected in all 3 HCV drug targets in 30/57 (53%) HCV genotype 1a infected subjects, and 1/6 (17%) HCV genotype 1b infected subjects.
                        


                        



                           Persistence of Resistance-Associated Substitutions
                        
                        The persistence of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and dasabuvir treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in NS5A, NS3, and NS5B, respectively, was assessed in HCV genotype 1a-infected subjects in Phase 2 trials whose virus had at least 1 treatment-emergent resistance-associated substitution in the drug target, and with available data through at least 24 weeks post-treatment.  Population and clonal nucleotide sequence analyses (assay sensitivity approximately 5-10%) were conducted to detect the persistence of viral populations with treatment-emergent substitutions.
                        For ombitasvir, viral populations with 1 or more resistance-associated treatment-emergent substitutions in NS5A persisted at detectable levels through at least Post-Treatment Week 24 in 24/24 (100%) subjects, and through Post-Treatment Week 48 in 18/18 (100%) subjects with available data.
                        For paritaprevir, viral populations with 1 or more treatment-emergent substitutions in NS3 persisted at detectable levels through at least Post-Treatment Week 24 in 17/29 (59%) subjects, and through Post-Treatment Week 48 in 5/22 (23%) subjects with available data.  Resistance-associated variant R155K remained detectable in 5/8 (63%) subjects through Post-Treatment Week 24, and in 1/5 (20%) subjects through Post-Treatment Week 48. Resistance-associated D168 substitutions remained detectable in 6/22 (27%) subjects through Post-Treatment Week 24, and were no longer detectable through Post-Treatment Week 48. 
                        For dasabuvir, viral populations with 1 or more treatment-emergent substitutions in NS5B persisted at detectable levels through at least Post-Treatment Week 24 in 11/16 (69%) subjects, and through Post-Treatment Week 48 in 8/15 (53%) subjects with available data.  Treatment-emergent S556G persisted through Post-Treatment Week 48 in 6/9 (67%) subjects.
                        Due to virologic failure rates in clinical trials of less than 1% for subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b, trends in persistence of treatment-emergent substitutions in this genotype could not be established.
                        The lack of detection of virus containing a resistance-associated substitution does not indicate that the resistant virus is no longer present at clinically significant levels. The long-term clinical impact of the emergence or persistence of virus containing VIEKIRA PAK-resistance-associated substitutions is unknown.
                        
                           Effect of Baseline HCV Polymorphisms on Treatment Response
                        
                        A pooled analysis of subjects in the Phase 3 clinical trials of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin was conducted to explore the association between baseline HCV NS5A, NS3, or NS5B resistance-associated polymorphisms and treatment outcome. Baseline samples from HCV genotype 1a infected subjects who experienced virologic failure (n=47), as well as samples from a subset of demographically matched subjects who achieved SVR (n=94), were analyzed to compare the frequencies of resistance-associated polymorphisms in these two populations. The NS3 Q80K polymorphism was detected in approximately 38% of subjects in this analysis and was enriched approximately 2-fold in virologic failure subjects compared to SVR-achieving subjects.  Ombitasvir resistance-associated polymorphisms in NS5A (pooling data from all resistance-associated amino acid positions) were detected in approximately 22% of subjects in this analysis and similarly were enriched approximately 2-fold in virologic failure subjects.  Dasabuvir resistance-associated polymorphisms in NS5B were detected in approximately 5% of subjects in this analysis and were not enriched in virologic failure subjects.
                        In contrast to the Phase 3 subset analysis, no association of NS3 or NS5A polymorphisms and treatment outcome was seen in an analysis of noncirrhotic HCV genotype 1a-infected subjects (n=174 for NS3 and n=183 for NS5A) who received ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin (for 12 or 24 weeks) in a Phase 2b trial. 
                        Baseline HCV polymorphisms are not expected to have a substantial impact on the likelihood of achieving SVR when VIEKIRA PAK is used as recommended for HCV genotype 1a and 1b infected patients, based on the low virologic failure rates observed in clinical trials.
                        
                           Cross-resistance
                        
                        Cross-resistance is expected among NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, and non-nucleoside NS5B-palm inhibitors by class. Dasabuvir retained full activity against HCV replicons containing a single NS5B L159F, S282T, or V321A substitution, which are associated with resistance or prior exposure to nucleos(t)ide analogue NS5B polymerase inhibitors. In clinical trials of VIEKIRA PAK, no subjects who experienced virologic failure had treatment-emergent substitutions potentially associated with resistance to nucleot(s)ide analogue NS5B polymerase inhibitors.
                         The impact of prior ombitasvir, paritaprevir, or dasabuvir treatment experience on the efficacy of other NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, or NS5B inhibitors has not been studied. Similarly, the efficacy of VIEKIRA PAK has not been studied in subjects who have failed prior treatment with another NS5A inhibitor, NS3/4A protease inhibitor, or NS5B inhibitor.
