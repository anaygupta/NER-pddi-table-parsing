                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.

                              The pharmacodynamic profiles for TOUJEO given subcutaneously as a single dose of 0.4, 0.6, or 0.9 U/kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes showed that on average, the onset of action develops over 6 hours post-dose for all three single doses of TOUJEO.

                              The pharmacodynamics for single 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 U/kg doses of TOUJEO in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study. On a unit-to-unit basis, TOUJEO had a lower maximum (GIRmax) and 24 hour glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC0–24) compared to LANTUS. The overall glucose lowering effect of TOUJEO 0.4 U/kg was 12% of the glucose lowering effect of an equivalent dose of LANTUS. Glucose lowering at least 30% of the effect of a single 0.4 U/kg dose of LANTUS was not observed until the single dose of TOUJEO exceeded 0.6 U/kg. 
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Multiple Once Daily Dose Pharmacodynamics
                                    
                                    The pharmacodynamics of TOUJEO after 8 days of daily injection was evaluated in 30 patients with type 1 diabetes.  At steady state, the 24 hour glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC0–24) of TOUJEO 0.4 U/kg was approximately 27% lower with a different distribution profile than that of an equivalent dose of LANTUS [See Dosage and Administration (2), Warning and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The glucose lowering effect of a TOUJEO dose increased with each daily administration.
                                    The pharmacodynamic profile for TOUJEO given subcutaneously as multiple once-daily subcutaneous injections of 0.4 U/kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes, is shown in Figure 1.

                              The pharmacokinetic profiles for single 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 U/kg doses of TOUJEO in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study. The median time to maximum serum insulin concentration was 12 (8–14), 12 (12–18), and 16 (12–20) hours, respectively. Mean serum insulin concentrations declined to the lower limit of quantitation of 5.02 µU/mL by 16, 28, and beyond 36 hours, respectively.
                              Steady state insulin concentrations are reached by at least 5 days of once daily subcutaneous administration of 0.4 U/kg to 0.6 U/kg doses of TOUJEO over 8 days in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
                              After subcutaneous injection of TOUJEO, the intra-subject variability, defined as the coefficient of variation for the insulin exposure during 24 hours was 21.0% at steady state.

                              After subcutaneous injection of TOUJEO in diabetic patients, insulin glargine is metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B-chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). The in vitro activity of M1 and M2 were similar to that of human insulin.
