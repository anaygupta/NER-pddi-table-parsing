                        The mechanism of action of SOOLANTRA cream in treating rosacea lesions is unknown.

                           Cardiac Electrophysiology
                           
At therapeutic doses, SOOLANTRA cream is not expected to prolong QTc interval.

                           Absorption
                           
The absorption of ivermectin from SOOLANTRA cream was evaluated in a clinical trial in 15 adult male and female subjects with severe papulopustular rosacea applying 1 g SOOLANTRA cream, 1% once daily. At steady state (after 2 weeks of treatment), the highest mean ± standard deviation plasma concentrations of ivermectin peaked (Tmax) at 10 ± 8 hours post dose, the maximum concentration (Cmax) was 2.10 ± 1.04 ng/mL (range: 0.69 - 4.02 ng/mL) and the area under the concentration curve (AUC0-24hr) was 36.14 ± 15.56 ng.hr/mL (range: 13.69-75.16 ng.hr/mL). In addition, systemic exposure assessment in longer treatment duration (Phase 3 studies) showed that there was no plasma accumulation of ivermectin over the 52-week treatment period.
                        
                           Distribution
                           
An in vitro study demonstrated that ivermectin is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins and is bound primarily to human serum albumin. No significant binding of ivermectin to erythrocytes was observed.
                        
                           Metabolism
                           
In vitro studies using human hepatic microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. In vitro studies show that ivermectin at therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 or 4A11, or induce 1A2, 2B6, 2C9 or 3A4.
                        
                           Excretion
                           
The apparent terminal half-life averaged 6.5 days (mean ± standard deviation: 155± 40 hours, range 92-238 hours) in patients receiving a once daily cutaneous application of SOOLANTRA cream for 28 days.
