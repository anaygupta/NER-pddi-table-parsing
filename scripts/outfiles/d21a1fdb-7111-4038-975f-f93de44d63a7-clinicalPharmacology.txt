                  Methenamine mandelate is readily absorbed but remains essentially inactive until it is excreted by the kidneys and concentrated in the urine. An acid urine is essential for antibacterial action, with maximum efficacy occurring at pH 5.5 or less.Â  In an acid urine, mandelic acid exerts its antibacterial action and also contributes to the acidification of the urine. Mandelic acid is excreted both by glomerular filtration and tubular excretion. The methenamine component is hydrolyzed in acid urine to ammonia and to the bactericidal agent formaldehyde.  Proportionally less formaldehyde is released as urinary pH approaches 6.0 and insufficient quantities are released above this level for therapeutic response.  There is equally effective antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, since the antibacterial action of mandelic acid and formaldehyde is nonspecific.  There are reports that methenamine mandelate is ineffective in some infections with Proteus vulgaris and urea-splitting strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and A aerogenes. Since urea-splitting strains may raise the pH of the urine, particular attention to supplementary acidification with agents such as ascorbic acid, and urinary pH monitoring is required. However, results in any single case will depend to a large extent on the underlying pathology and the overall management.
