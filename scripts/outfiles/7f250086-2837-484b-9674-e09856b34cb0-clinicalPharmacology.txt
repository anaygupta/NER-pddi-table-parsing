                  The renal clearance of sodium iothalamate in man closely approximates that ofÂ 
                  inulin. The compound is cleared by glomerular filtration without tubular secretion
                   or reabsorption. Following infusion administration of I-125 iothalamate, the 
                  effective half-life is about 0.07 days.
