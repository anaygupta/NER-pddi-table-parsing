                        In controlled trials, terazosin capsules have been added to diuretics, and several beta-adrenergic blockers; no unexpected interactions were observed. Terazosin capsules have also been used in patients on a variety of concomitant therapies; while these were not formal interaction studies, no interactions were observed. Terazosin capsules have been used concomitantly in at least 50 patients on the following drugs or drug classes:  
                        
                           analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine, ibuprofen, indomethacin);
                           antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole);
                           anticholinergic/sympathomimetics (e.g., phenylephrine hydrochloride, phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride);
                           antigout (e.g., allopurinol);
                           antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine);
                           cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, methyclothiazide, propranolol);
                           corticosteroids;
