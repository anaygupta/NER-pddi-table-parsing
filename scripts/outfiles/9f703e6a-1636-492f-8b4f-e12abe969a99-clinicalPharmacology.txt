                  The most important characteristic of contrast
media is the iodine content. The relatively high atomic weight of
iodine contributes sufficient radiodensity for radiographic contrast
of the uterus and uterine tubes with surrounding tissues.
                  Diagnostic intrauterine radiopaque
agents have few known pharmacological effects. Most of the medium
within the uterine cavity is discharged immediately upon termination
of the procedure. Any medium retained in the uterine cavity is completely
absorbed within one hour, unless there is an obstruction and large
hydrosalpinx, in which case absorption is generally complete within
24 hours. Any medium spilled into the peritoneal cavity is absorbed
within 20 to 60 minutes and excreted by both the hepatic and renal
systems.
