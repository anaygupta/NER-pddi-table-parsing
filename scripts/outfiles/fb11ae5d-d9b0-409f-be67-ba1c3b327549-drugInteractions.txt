                        Because diethylpropion hydrochloride is a monoamine, hypertension may result when this agent is used with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (see 
                              CONTRAINDICATIONS
                           ).
                        Efficacy of diethylpropion with other anorectic agents has not been studied and the combined use may have the potential for serious cardiac problems; therefore, the concomitant use with other anorectic agents is contraindicated.
                        Antidiabetic drug requirements (i.e., insulin) may be altered. Concurrent use with general anesthetics may result in arrhythmias. The pressor effects of diethylpropion and those of other drugs may be additive when the drugs are used concomitantly; conversely, diethylpropion may interfere with antihypertensive drugs (i.e., guanethidine, Î±-methyldopa). Concurrent use of phenothiazines may antagonize the anorectic effect of diethylpropion.
