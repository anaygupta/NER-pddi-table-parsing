Drug Interactions: Corticosteroids may be used to restore responsiveness to isoproterenol if necessary.  This may come about by increasing the sensitivity of the beta-adrenergic receptors to isoproterenol.  No adverse cardiovascular effects were observed in normal volunteers given isoproterenol by inhalation along with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor or a tricyclic anti-depressant.Drug Interactions: Corticosteroids may be used to restore responsiveness to isoproterenol if necessary.

No adverse cardiovascular effects were observed in normal volunteers given isoproterenol by inhalation along with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor or a tricyclic anti-depressant.Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids and isoproterenol may result in additive peripheral vasoconstriction.Arrhythmias may result from the administration of isoproterenol to patients who are receiving digitalis, epinephrine, cyclopropane, or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics.  Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs such as propranolol antagonize the cardiac, bronchodilating, and vasodilating effects of isoproterenol.
