                  Interaction with Potassium Sparing Diuretics: Hypokalemia should not be treated by the concomitant administration of potassium salts and potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene or amiloride) since the simultaneous administration of these agents can produce severe hyperkalemia. Interaction with ACE inhibitors: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g., captopril, enlapril) will produce some potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Potassium supplements should be given to patients receiving ACE inhibitors only with close monitoring.
