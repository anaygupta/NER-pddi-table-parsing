                     7.1 Live Virus Vaccines
                     
                        Administration of WinRho® SDF concomitantly with other drugs has not been evaluated. Passive transfer of antibodies may transiently impair the immune response to live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (see Patient Counseling Information [17.1]). Do not give immunization with live vaccines within 3 months after WinRho® SDF administration.
