                        Omega-3-acids may prolong bleeding time.  Patients taking OMTRYG and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation (e.g., anti-platelet agents) should be monitored periodically.

                     7.1 Anticoagulants or Other Drugs Affecting Coagulation
                     
                        Some studies with omega-3-acids demonstrated prolongation of bleeding time.  The prolongation of bleeding time reported in these studies has not exceeded normal limits and did not produce clinically significant bleeding episodes.  Clinical studies have not been done to thoroughly examine the effect of OMTRYG and concomitant anticoagulants.  Patients receiving treatment with OMTRYG and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation (e.g., anti-platelet agents) should be monitored periodically.
