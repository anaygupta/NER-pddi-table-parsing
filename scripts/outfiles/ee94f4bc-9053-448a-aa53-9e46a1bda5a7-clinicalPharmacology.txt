                  Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine at postganglionic parasympathetic neuroeffector sites including smooth muscle, secretory glands and CNS sites. Large doses may block nicotinic receptors at the autonomic ganglia and at the neuromuscular junction.
    Specific anticholinergic responses are dose-related. Small doses of atropine inhibit salivary and bronchial secretions and sweating; moderate doses dilate the pupil, inhibit accommodation and increase the heart rate (vagolytic effect); larger doses will decrease motility of the GI and urinary tracts; very large doses will inhibit gastric acid secretion.
