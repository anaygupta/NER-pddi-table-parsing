                              •Chloramphenicol may inhibit hematologic response to vitamin B12 therapy in pernicious anemia patients (7.2)
                           
                              •Phenytoin may decrease folic acid concentrations; therefore, coadministration should be avoided in pregnancy (7.2) 
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Clinical Interactions Affecting Levels of Co-administered Drugs
                     
                        
                           Folic Acid
                        
                        Phenytoin metabolism may be increased by folic acid. Folic acid may lower the serum concentration of phenytoin resulting in increased seizure activity.
                        Patient’s response to methotrexate therapy may be decreased by folic acid.
                        
                           Pyridoxine
                        
                        The metabolism of levodopa may be increased and its efficacy may be decreased by pyridoxine.
                        
                           Antibiotics
                        
                        Antibiotic activity of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin is decreased by thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid. Bleomycin is inactivated in vitro by ascorbic acid and riboflavin.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Clinical Interactions Affecting Vitamin Levels
                     
                        
                           Hydralazine, Isoniazid
                        
                        Pyridoxine requirements may be increased by concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid.
                        
                           Chloramphenicol
                        
                        In patients with pernicious anemia, the hematologic response to vitamin B12 therapy may be inhibited by concomitant administration of chloramphenicol.
                        
                           Phenytoin
                        
                        Serum folic acid concentrations may be decreased by phenytoin and, therefore it should be avoided in pregnancy.
