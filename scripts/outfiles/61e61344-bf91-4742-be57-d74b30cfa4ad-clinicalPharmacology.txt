Guaifenesin is an expectorant, which increases respiratory tract fluid secretions and helps to loosen phlegm and bronchial secretions.  By reducing the viscosity  of secretions, guaifenesin increases the efficiency of the cough reflex and of ciliary action in removing accumulated secretions from the trachea and bronchi.
