                  Aminosyn II, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection) provides crystalline amino        acids to promote protein synthesis and wound healing, and to reduce the rate of endogenous        protein catabolism. Aminosyn II, given by central venous infusion in combination with        concentrated dextrose, electrolytes, vitamins, trace metals, and ancillary fat supplements,        constitutes total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Aminosyn II can also be administered by        peripheral vein with dextrose and maintenance electrolytes. Intravenous fat emulsion may be        substituted for part of the carbohydrate calories during either TPN or peripheral vein        administration of Aminosyn II.
