                  Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with LUCENTIS.
                  LUCENTIS intravitreal injection has been used adjunctively with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT). Twelve (12) of 105 (11%) patients with neovascular AMD developed serious intraocular inflammation; in 10 of the 12 patients, this occurred when LUCENTIS was administered 7 days (Â± 2 days) after verteporfin PDT.
