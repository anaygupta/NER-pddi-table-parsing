CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Alcohol and Dextrose Injections USP are an intravenous source of calories. In the average adult, pure ethyl alcohol is metabolized at a rate of 10 to 20 mL per hour. Sedative effects of alcohol occur if the rate of infusion exceeds the rate of metabolism. Dextrose (D-glucose) can be infused at a maximum rate of approximately 0.5 to 0.85 g/kg of body weight/hr without producing significant glycosuria. Thus, the maximum rate that alcohol can be infused without producing sedative effects is well below the maximum rate of utilization of dextrose.Alcohol is metabolized, mostly in the liver, to acetaldehyde or acetate. The rate of oxidation is a linear function of time. Starvation lowers the rate of metabolism and insulin increases the rate.
