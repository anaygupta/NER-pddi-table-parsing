7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
Following injection, VASOVIST binds to blood albumin and has the potential to alter the binding of other drugs that also bind to albumin.  No drug interaction reactions were observed in clinical trials.  Consider the possibility of VASOVIST interaction with concomitantly administered medications that bind to albumin.  An interaction may enhance or decrease the activity of the concomitant medication [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].





7.1	Warfarin
In a clinical trial of 10 patients receiving a stable dose of warfarin, a single dose of VASOVIST (0.05 mmol/kg) did not alter the anticoagulant activity of warfarin as measured by the International Normalized Ratio (INR).
