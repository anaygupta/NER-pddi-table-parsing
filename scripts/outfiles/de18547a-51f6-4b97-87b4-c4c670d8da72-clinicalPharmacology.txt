               Dihydrocodeine is a semi-synthetic narcotic analgesic related to codeine, with multiple actions 
qualitatively similar to those of codeine; the most prominent of these involve the central nervous 
system and organs with smooth muscle components. 

                  
Phenylephrine HCl is a sympathomimetic, which acts predominately on alpha-receptors and has little 
action on beta-receptors. It therefore functions as an oral nasal decongestant with minimal CNS 
stimulation.

                  
Pyrilamine Maleate is an antihistamine used in suppressing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. However, it 
is more prone to cause drowsiness than some other antihistamines.
