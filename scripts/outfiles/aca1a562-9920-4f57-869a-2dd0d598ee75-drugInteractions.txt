                        Clinically important interactions may occur when certain drugs 
are administered concomitantly with aspirin or aspirin-containing drugs.
                        
                           1. Oral Anticoagulants-By interfering with 
platelet function or decreasing plasma prothrombin concentration, aspirin 
enhances the potential for bleeding in patients on anticoagulants.
                        2. Methotrexate-aspirin enhances the toxic effects 
of this drug.
                        3. Probenecid and Sulfinpyrazone-large doses of 
aspirin reduce the uricosuric effect of both drugs.Â  Renal excretion of 
salicylate may also be reduced.
                        4. Oral Antidiabetic Drugs-enhancement of 
hypoglycemia may occur.
                        5. Antacids-to the extent that they raise urinary 
pH, antacids may substantially decrease plasma salicylate concentrations; 
conversely, their withdrawal can result in a substantial increase.
                        6. Ammonium Chloride-this and other drugs that 
acidify a relatively alkaline urine can elevate plasma salicylate 
concentrations.
                        7. Ethyl Alcohol-enhanced aspirin-induced fecal 
blood loss has been reported.
                        8. Corticosteroids-salicylate plasma levels may be 
decreased when adrenal corticosteroids are given, and may be increased 
substantially when they are discontinued.
