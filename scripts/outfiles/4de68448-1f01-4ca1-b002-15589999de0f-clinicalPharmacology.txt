               Dihydrocodeine is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic antitussive related to codeine, with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine:  the most prominent of these involve the central nervous system and organs with smooth muscle components.

                  
Brompheniramine Maleate is an antihistamine antagonist, specifically an H1-receptor-blocking agent belonging to the alkylamine class of antihistamines.  Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for receptor sites on effector cells.  Among the antihistamine effects, it antagonizes the allergic response (vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, increased mucus secretion) of nasal tissue.

                  
Brompheniramine Maleate also has anticholinergic (drying) and sedative effects.  Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination, mostly as products of biodegradation; the liver is assumed to be the main site of metabolic transformation.

                  
Pseudophedrine Hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine, which acts prodominately on alpha-receptors and has little action on beta-receptors.  It therefore functions as an oral nasal decongestant with minimal CNS stimulation.
