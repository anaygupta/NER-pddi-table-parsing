                        Omega-3-acids may prolong bleeding time. Patients taking omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation (e.g., anti-platelet agents) should be monitored periodically.

                        7.1 Â Anticoagulants or Other Drugs Affecting Coagulation 
                     
                     
                        Some trials with omega-3-acids demonstrated prolongation of bleeding time. The prolongation of bleeding time reported in these trials has not exceeded normal limits and did not produce clinically significant bleeding episodes. Clinical trials have not been done to thoroughly examine the effect of omega-3-acid ethyl esters and concomitant anticoagulants. Patients receiving treatment with omega-3-acid ethyl esters and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation (e.g., anti-platelet agents) should be monitored periodically.
