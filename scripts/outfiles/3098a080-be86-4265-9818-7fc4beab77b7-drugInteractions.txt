                  No investigations of interaction between LIALDA and other drugs  except for certain antibiotics have been performed [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. However, the following drug-drug interactions have been reported for products containing mesalamine:
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Nephrotoxic agents including NSAIDs: renal reactions have been reported. (7.1)
                           Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine: blood disorders have been reported. (7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
                     
                        The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of renal reactions.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine
                     
                        The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine may increase the risk for blood disorders.
