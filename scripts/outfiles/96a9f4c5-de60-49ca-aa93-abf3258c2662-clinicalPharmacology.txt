                  The mechanism of action of doxepin is not definitely known. It is 
not a central nervous system stimulant nor a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The 
current hypothesis is that the clinical effects are due, at least in part, to 
influences on the adrenergic activity at the synapses so that deactivation of 
norepinephrine by reuptake into the nerve terminals is prevented. Animal studies 
suggest that doxepin does not appreciably antagonize the antihypertensive action 
of guanethidine. In animal studies anticholinergic, antiserotonin and 
antihistamine effects on smooth muscle have been demonstrated. At higher than 
usual clinical doses norepinephrine response was potentiated in animals. This 
effect was not demonstrated in humans.
                  At clinical dosages up to 150 mg per day, doxepin can be given to man 
concomitantly with guanethidine and related compounds without blocking the 
antihypertensive effect. At dosages above 150 mg per day blocking of the 
antihypertensive effect of these compounds has been reported.
                  Doxepin is virtually devoid of euphoria as a side effect. Characteristic of 
this type of compound, doxepin has not been demonstrated to produce the physical 
tolerance or psychological dependence associated with addictive compounds.
