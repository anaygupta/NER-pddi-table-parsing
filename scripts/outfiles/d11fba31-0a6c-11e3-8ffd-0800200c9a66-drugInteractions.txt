                           Digoxin:  Monitor serum calcium more frequently when using NATPARA in patients receiving digoxin. (5.5, 7.2) 
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Alendronate
                     
                        Co-administration of alendronate and NATPARA leads to reduction in the calcium sparing effect, which can interfere with the normalization of serum calcium. Concomitant use of NATPARA with alendronate is not recommended.

                        NATPARA causes transient increase in calcium and therefore, concomitant use of NATPARA and cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. Digoxin efficacy is reduced if hypocalcemia is present.  In patients using NATPARA concomitantly with digoxin, carefully monitor serum calcium and digoxin levels, and patients for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity.  Adjustment of digoxin and/or NATPARA may be needed. No drug-drug interaction study has been conducted with digoxin and NATPARA.
