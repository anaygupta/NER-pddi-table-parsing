                            Mixed agonist/antagonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with AVINZA because they may reduce analgesic effect of AVINZA or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.12, 7.3)
                            Muscle relaxants: Avoid use with AVINZA because of increased risk of respiratory depression. (7.4)
                            Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid AVINZA in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.5)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Alcohol
                     
                        Concomitant use of alcohol with AVINZA can result in an increase of morphine plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of morphine. Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on AVINZA therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 CNS Depressants
                     
                        Concurrent use of AVINZA and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, general anesthetics, antiemetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and AVINZA for signs of respiratory depression and hypotension. When such combined therapy is contemplated, reduce the initial dose of one or both agents.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics
                     
                        Mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine and butorphanol) may reduce the analgesic effect of AVINZA or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist analgesics in patients receiving AVINZA.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Muscle Relaxants
                     
                        Morphine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and AVINZA for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)
                     
                        The effects of morphine may be potentiated by MAOIs. Monitor patients on concurrent therapy with an MAOI and AVINZA for increased respiratory and central nervous system depression. MAOIs have been reported to potentiate the effects of morphine anxiety, confusion, and significant depression of respiration or coma. AVINZA should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6 Cimetidine
                     
                        Cimetidine can potentiate morphine-induced respiratory depression. There is a report of confusion and severe respiratory depression when a patient undergoing hemodialysis was concurrently administered morphine and cimetidine. Monitor patients for respiratory depression when AVINZA and cimetidine are used concurrently.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.7 Diuretics
                     
                        Morphine can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Morphine may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.8 Anticholinergics
                     
                        Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when AVINZA is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.9 P-Glycoprotein (PGP) Inhibitors
                     
                        PGP inhibitors (e.g. quinidine) may increase the absorption/exposure of morphine sulfate by about two-fold. Therefore, monitor patients for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression when AVINZA is used concurrently with PGP inhibitors.
