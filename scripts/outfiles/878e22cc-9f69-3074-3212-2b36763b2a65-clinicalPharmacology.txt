PHARMACOLOGY:
               
                  Oral iron is absorbed most efficiently
when administered between meals. Iron is critical for normal hemoglobin
synthesis to maintain oxygen transport for energy production and proper
function of cells. Adequate amounts of iron are necessary for effective
erythropolesis. Iron also serves as a cofactor of several essential
enzymes, Including cytochromes, which are involved in electron transport.
Folic acid is required for nucleoprotein synthesis and the maintenance
of normal erytropolesis. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic
acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions
In the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids.
Deficiency of folic acid may account for the defective deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic
macrocytic anemias. Vitamin B12 is essential
to growth, cell reproduction, hematopolesis, nucleic acid, and myelin
synthesis. Deficiency may result in megaloblastic anemia or pernicious
anemia.
