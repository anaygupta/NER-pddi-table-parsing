                     7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants
                     
                        Concurrent use of Azelastine HCl Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray), 0.15% with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because reductions in alertness and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Erythromycin and Ketoconazole
                     
                        Interaction studies investigating the cardiac effects, as measured by the corrected QT interval (QTc), of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. Oral erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) had no effect on azelastine pharmacokinetics or QTc based on analyses of serial electrocardiograms. Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for 7 days) interfered with the measurement of azelastine plasma concentrations on the analytic HPLC; however, no effects on QTc were observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Cimetidine
                     
                        Cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased the mean Cmax
                           and AUC of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) by approximately 65% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
