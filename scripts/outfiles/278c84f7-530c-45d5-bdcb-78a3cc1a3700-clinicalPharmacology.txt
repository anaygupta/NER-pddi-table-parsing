                  Human Pharmacology:
                     Cephalexin is acid stable and may be given without regard to 
meals. It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Following doses of 250 
mg, 500 mg, and 1 g, average peak serum levels of approximately 9, 18, and 32 
mcg/mL respectively were obtained at 1 hour. Measurable levels were present 6 
hours after administration. Cephalexin is excreted in the urine by glomerular 
filtration and tubular secretion. Studies showed that over 90% of the drug was 
excreted unchanged in the urine within 8 hours. During this period, peak urine 
concentrations following the 250-mg, 500-mg, and 1-g doses were approximately 
1000, 2200, and 5000 mcg/mL respectively.
