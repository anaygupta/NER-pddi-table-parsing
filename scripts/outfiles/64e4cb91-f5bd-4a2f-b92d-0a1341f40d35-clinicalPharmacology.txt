of agents, and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticosteroids may 
inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, concomitant 
antimicrobial drugs may be used when this inhibition is considered to be 
clinically significant in a particular case.
                  When a decision to administer both a corticosteroid and antimicrobials is 
made, the administration of such drugs in combination has the advantage of 
greater patient compliance and convenience, with the added assurance that the 
intended dosage of all drugs is administered. When each type of drug is in the 
same formulation, compatibility of ingredients is assured and the correct volume 
of drug is delivered and retained.
                  The relative potency of corticosteroids depends on the molecular structure, 
concentration, and release from the vehicle.
                  
                     Microbiology: The anti-infective components in 
Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Suspension are 
included to provide action against specific organisms susceptible to it. 
Neomycin sulfate and polymyxin B sulfate are active in vitro 
against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia 
coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella/Enterbacter species, Neisseria species, and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa. The product does not provide adequate coverage against Serratia marcescens and streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae (see 
                        INDICATIONS AND USAGE
                     ).
