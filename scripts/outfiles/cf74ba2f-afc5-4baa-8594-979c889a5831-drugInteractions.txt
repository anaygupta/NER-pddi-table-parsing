                           Potent inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (e.g., ketoconazole): Reduce dose to 5 mg once daily. (2.3, 7.1)
                           One or more concomitant medications that result in both moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 and potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (e.g., fluconazole): Reduce dose to 5 mg once daily. (2.3, 7.2)
                           Potent CYP inducers (e.g., rifampin): May result in loss of or reduced clinical response. (2.3, 7.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                     
                        Tofacitinib exposure is increased when XELJANZ is coadministered with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Figure 3].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Moderate CYP3A4 and Potent CYP2C19 Inhibitors
                     
                        Tofacitinib exposure is increased when XELJANZ is coadministered with medications that result in both moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 and potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (e.g., fluconazole) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Figure 3].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Potent CYP3A4 Inducers
                     
                        Tofacitinib exposure is decreased when XELJANZ is coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Figure 3].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Immunosuppressive Drugs
                     
                        There is a risk of added immunosuppression when XELJANZ is coadministered with potent immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., azathioprine, tacrolimus, cyclosporine). Combined use of multiple-dose XELJANZ with potent immunosuppressants has not been studied in rheumatoid arthritis. Use of XELJANZ in combination with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
