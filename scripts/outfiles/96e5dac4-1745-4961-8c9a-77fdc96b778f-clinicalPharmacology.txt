                  Isometheptene mucate, a sympathomimetic amine, acts by constricting dilated cranial and cerebral arterioles, thus reducing the stimuli that lead to vascular headaches. It is particularly desirable in patients predisposed to nausea and vomiting, and where ergotamines are precluded. Its action is similar to ergotamine but possesses a low order of toxicity.
                  Caffeine, also a cranial vasoconstrictor, is added to further enhance the vasoconstrictor effect. It is also used as a central stimulant for relief of headache.
                  Acetaminophen, an effective non-narcotic analgesic, reduces the perception of pain impulses originating from dilated cerebral vessels; no hyperacidity of stomach and less allergies than aspirin.
