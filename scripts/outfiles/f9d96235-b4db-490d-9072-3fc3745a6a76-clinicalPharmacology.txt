                  Antipyrine and Benzocaine Otic Solution combines the hygroscopic property of anhydrous glycerin with the analgesic action of antipyrine and benzocaine to relieve pressure, reduce inflammation and congestion, and to alleviate pain and discomfort in acute otitis media.
                  Antipyrine and Benzocaine Otic Solution does not blanch the tympanic membrane or mask the landmarks and, therefore, does not distort the otoscopic picture.
