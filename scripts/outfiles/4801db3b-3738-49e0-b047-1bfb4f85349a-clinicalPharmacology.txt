                  The mechanism by which hyposensitization is achieved is not known completely. It has been shown that repeated injections of appropriate allergenic extracts will ameliorate the intensity of allergic symptoms upon contact with the allergen.10, 11, 12, 13  Clinical studies which address the efficacy of immunotherapy are available. The allergens which have been studied are cat, mite, venoms, and some pollen extracts.9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19  IgE antibodies bound to receptors on mast cell membranes are required for the allergic reaction, and their level is probably related to serum IgE concentrations. Immunotherapy has been associated with decreased levels of IgE, and also with increases in allergen specific IgG "blocking" antibody.  

                  
                  The histamine release response of circulating basophils to a specific allergen is reduced in some patients by hyposensitization, but the mechanism of this change is not clear. 

                  
                  Further study and clarification of the relationships among changes in blocking antibody, reaginic antibody, and mediator-releasing cells, and between these three factors and successful immunotherapy, is needed.
