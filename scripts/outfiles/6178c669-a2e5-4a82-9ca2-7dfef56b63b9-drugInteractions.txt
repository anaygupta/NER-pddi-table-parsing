                          Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies 
                          with warfarin and digoxin. Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same 
                          active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction
                          studies with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, warfarin, enalapril, metoprolol and
                          iron.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                                      Sevelamer decreases the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by
                                      approximately 50%. (7.1)
                           
                                      Sevelamer did
                                      not alter the pharmacokinetics of single doses of digoxin,
                                      warfarin, enalapril, metoprolol, or

                                      When administering an oral medication where a reduction in
                                      the bioavailability of that medication would have a
                                      clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, administer the
                                      drug at least one hour before or three hours after Renvela, and monitor 
                                      blood levels of the drug. (7.7)

                        In a study of 15 healthy subjects, a co-administered
                                    single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride decreased
                                    the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately
                                    50%.

                        In 19 healthy subjects receiving 2.4 grams of sevelamer
                                    hydrochloride three times a day with meals for 2 days, sevelamer
                                    did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
                                    digoxin.
                        
                                In 18 healthy subjects receiving 9.6 grams of sevelamer carbonate once daily,
                                sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of digoxin.

                                  In 14 healthy subjects receiving 2.4 g of sevelamer
                                  hydrochloride three times a day with meals, sevelamer did not alter 
                                  the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of warfarin.

                                daily with meal, sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single 
                                dose of warfarin.

                                    sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a
                                    single dose of enalapril.

                        In 31 healthy subjects a single 2.4 gram dose of
                                    sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a
                                    single dose of metoprolol.

                        In 23 healthy subjects, a single 2.8 gram dose of
                                    sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the absorption of a single
                                    oral dose of iron as 200 mg exsiccated ferrous sulfate
                                    tablet.

                                  There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions
                                  between Renvela and most concomitant drugs. During postmarketing
                                  experience, very rare cases of increased thyroid stimulating
                                  hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients
                                  co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine.

                                  patients receiving both medications.
                        
                                  When administering an oral medication where a reduction
                                  in the bioavailability of that medication would have a
                                  clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, there is
                                  no information that suggests a dosing regimen that would be universally
                                  appropriate for all drugs. One may, however, administer the
                                  drug one hour before or three hours after Renvela, and when important, monitor
                                  blood levels of the drug. Patients taking anti-arrhythmic
                                  medications for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure
                                  medications for the control of seizure disorders were excluded
                                  from the clinical trials.
