                     Overview: No formal drug-drug, drug-food, or drug-herb interaction studies were performed with SUPPRELIN LA.
                  
                     Drug-Laboratory Interactions: Therapy with SUPPRELIN LA results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Results of diagnostic tests of pituitary gonadotropic and gonadal functions conducted during and after SUPPRELIN LA therapy may be affected. SUPPRELIN LA decreased mean serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels by approximately 11% in one study (Study 1). SUPPRELIN LA increased the serum concentration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in 8 of 36 patients in another study (Study 2).
