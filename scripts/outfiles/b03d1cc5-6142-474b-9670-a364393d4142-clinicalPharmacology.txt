* Administered at the start of a light meal.
† Mean values of 24 normal volunteers. Peak concentrations occurred 
approximately 1 hour after the dose.Amoxicillin is stable in the presence of gastric acid and is 
rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The effect of food on the absorption 
of amoxicillin from the tablets and suspension has been partially investigated. 
The 400 mg and 875 mg formulations have been studied only when administered at 
the start of a light meal. However, food effect studies have not been performed 
with the 200 mg and 500 mg formulations. Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most 
body tissues and fluids, with the exception of brain and spinal fluid, except 
when meninges are inflamed. The half-life of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Most 
of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged in the urine; its excretion can be 
delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid. In blood serum, amoxicillin 
is approximately 20% protein-bound.
                  Orally administered doses of 250 mg and 500 mg of amoxicillin capsules result 
in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 
3.5 mcg/mL to 5 mcg/mL and 5.5 mcg/mL to 7.5 mcg/mL, respectively.
                  Mean amoxicillin pharmacokinetic parameters from an open, two-part, 
single-dose crossover bioequivalence study in 27 adults comparing 875 mg of 
Amoxicillin tablets with 875 mg of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium showed 
that the 875 mg tablet of amoxicillin produces an AUC0-∞ 
of 35.4 ± 8.1 mcg∙hr/mL and a Cmax of 13.8 ± 4.1 mcg/mL. 
Dosing was at the start of a light meal following an overnight fast.
                  Oral administration of single doses of amoxicillin 400 mg chewable tablets 
and 400 mg/5 mL suspension to 24 adult volunteers yielded the following 
pharmacokinetic data:
                  Orally administered doses of amoxicillin suspension, 125 mg/5 mL and 250 mg/5 
mL, result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the 
range of 1.5 mcg/mL to 3 mcg/mL and 3.5 mcg/mL to 5 mcg/ mL, respectively.
                  Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally 
administered dose of amoxicillin. Following a 1 gram dose and utilizing a 
special skin window technique to determine levels of the antibiotic, it was 
noted that therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid. 
Approximately 60% of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in 
the urine within 6 to 8 hours.
