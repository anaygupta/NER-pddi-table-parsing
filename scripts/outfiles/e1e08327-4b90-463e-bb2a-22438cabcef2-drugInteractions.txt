                  Concurrent administration of ethionamide has been reported to 
potentiate neurotoxic side effects. 
                  Alcohol and Seromycin are incompatible, especially during a regimen calling 
for large doses of the latter. Alcohol increases the possibility and risk of 
epileptic episodes. 
                  Concurrent administration of isoniazid may result in increased incidence of 
CNS effects, such as dizziness or drowsiness. Dosage adjustments may be 
necessary and patients should be monitored closely for signs of CNS toxicity. 
Carcinogenesis, 
Mutagenicity, and Impairment of Fertility 
Studies have not been performed to determine potential for carcinogenicity. 
The Ames test and unscheduled DNA repair test were negative. A study in 
2 generations of rats showed no impairment of fertility relative to controls for 
the first mating but somewhat lower fertility in the second mating.
