Drug Interactions





Local Anesthetics: Administration of DepoDur three minutes after a 3-mL test-dose (lidocaine 1.5% and epinephrine 1:200,000) increases peak serum concentrations of morphine (SeeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Increasing the interval between the test dose and DepoDur administration to at least 15 minutes minimizes this pharmacokinetic interaction.CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Increasing the interval between the test dose and DepoDur administration to at least 15 minutes minimizes this pharmacokinetic interaction.Safety and efficacy of DepoDur when used in conjunction with therapeutic epidural doses of lidocaine with epinephrine (for conduction anesthesia) have not been studied in clinical trials.







CNS Depressants: The concurrent use of other central nervous system (CNS) depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, general anesthetics, droperidol, phenothiazines or other tranquilizers, or alcohol increases the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma. Use with caution and with vigilant monitoring in patients taking these agents.







Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): MAOIs markedly potentiate the action of morphine. DepoDur should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.







Muscle Relaxants: Respiratory depression associated with morphine may delay recovery of spontaneous pulmonary ventilation when neuromuscular blocking agents are coadministered.
