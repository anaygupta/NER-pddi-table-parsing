                  Barium sulfate, due to its high
molecular density is opaque to x-rays and, therefore, acts as a positive
contrast agent for radiographic studies. Barium sulfate is biologically
inert and therefore, is not absorbed or metabolized by the body, and
is eliminated unchanged from the body.
