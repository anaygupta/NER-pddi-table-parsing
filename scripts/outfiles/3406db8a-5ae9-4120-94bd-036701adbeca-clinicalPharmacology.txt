                           BECAUSE THE MAJOR ELIMINATION PATHWAY FOR GANCICLOVIR IS RENAL, DOSAGE REDUCTIONS ACCORDING TO CREATININE CLEARANCE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR GANCICLOVIR CAPSULES. FOR DOSING INSTRUCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL IMPAIRMENT, REFER TO DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.
                        
                        
                           
                              Absorption: 
                           The absolute bioavailability of oral ganciclovir under fasting conditions was approximately 5% (n = 6) and following food was 6% to 9% (n = 32). When ganciclovir was administered orally with food at a total daily dosage of 3 g/day (500 mg q3h, 6 times daily and 1000 mg tid), the steady-state absorption as measured by area under the serum concentration vs time curve (AUC) over 24 hours and maximum serum concentrations (Cmax) were similar  following both regimens with an AUC0-24 of 15.9 ± 4.2 (mean ± SD) and  15.4 ± 4.3 mcg•hr/mL and Cmax of 1.02 ± 0.24 and 1.18 ± 0.36 mcg/mL,  respectively (n = 16).
                        
                           Food Effects: When ganciclovir capsules were given with a meal containing 602 calories and 46.5% fat at a dosage of 1000 mg every 8 hours to 20 HIV-positive subjects, the steady-state AUC increased by 22 ± 22% (range: -6% to 68%) and there was a significant prolongation of time to peak serum concentrations (Tmax) from 1.8 ± 0.8 to 3 ± 0.6 hours and a higher Cmax  (0.85 ± 0.25 vs 0.96 ± 0.27 mcg/mL) (n = 20).
                        
                           
                              Distribution: 
                           For ganciclovir capsules, no correlation was observed between AUC and reciprocal weight (range: 55 to 128 kg); oral dosing according to weight is not required. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL.
                        
                           
                              Metabolism: 
                           Following oral administration of a single 1000 mg dose of 14C-labeled  ganciclovir, 86 ± 3% of the administered dose was recovered in the  feces and 5 ± 1% was recovered in the urine (n = 4). No metabolite accounted for more than 1% to 2% of the radioactivity recovered in urine or feces.
                        
                           
                              Elimination: 
                           When administered orally, it exhibits linear kinetics up to a total daily dose of 4 g/day. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. After oral administration of ganciclovir, steady-state is achieved within 24 hours. Renal clearance following oral administration was 3.1 ± 1.2 mL/min/kg (n = 22). Half-life was 4.8 ± 0.9 hours (n = 39) following oral administration.
                        
                           Special Populations: The pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir following oral administration of ganciclovir capsules were evaluated in 44 patients, who were either solid organ transplant recipients or HIV positive. Apparent oral clearance of ganciclovir decreased and AUC0-24
                           h increased with diminishing renal function (as expressed by creatinine clearance).
                        Based on these observations, it is necessary to modify the dosage of ganciclovir in patients with renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
                        Hemodialysis reduces plasma concentrations of ganciclovir by about 50% after oral administration.
                        
                           Race/Ethnicity and Gender: The effects of race/ethnicity and gender were studied in subjects receiving a dose regimen of 1000 mg every 8 hours. Although the numbers of blacks (16%) and Hispanics (20%) were small, there appeared to be a trend towards a lower steady-state Cmax and AUC0-8 in these subpopulations as compared to Caucasians. No definitive conclusions regarding gender differences could be made because of the small number of females (12%); however, no differences between males and females were observed.
                        
                           Elderly: No studies have been conducted in adults older than 65 years of age.
