                  Application of 
       
 
  14C-labeled mupirocin ointment to the lower arm of normal male subjects followed by occlusion for 24 hours showed no measurable systemic absorption (< 1.1 nanogram mupirocin per milliliter of whole blood). Measurable radioactivity was present in the stratum corneum of these subjects 72 hours after application.
      

 
                  Following intravenous or oral administration, mupirocin is rapidly metabolized. The principal metabolite, monic acid, is eliminated by renal excretion, and demonstrates no antibacterial activity. In a trial conducted in 7 healthy adult male subjects, the elimination half-life after intravenous administration of mupirocin was 20 to 40 minutes for mupirocin and 30 to 80 minutes for monic acid. The pharmacokinetics of mupirocin has not been studied in individuals with renal insufficiency.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Microbiology
                     
                        Mupirocin is an antibacterial agent produced by fermentation using the organism 
         
 
  Pseudomonas
                           fluorescens. Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA (tRNA) synthetase. Due to this unique mode of action, mupirocin does not demonstrate cross-resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents.
        

 
                        
                        When mupirocin resistance occurs, it results from the production of a modified isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, or the acquisition of, by genetic transfer, a plasmid mediating a new isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (MIC > 512 mcg/mL) has been reported in increasing numbers of isolates of 
         
 
  Staphylococcus
                           aureus and with higher frequency in coagulase-negative staphylococci. Mupirocin resistance occurs with greater frequency in methicillin-resistant than methicillin-susceptible staphylococci. Because of the occurrence of mupirocin resistance in methicillin-resistant 
         
 
  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), it is appropriate to test MRSA populations for mupirocin susceptibility prior to the use of mupirocin using a standardized method.

                        Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration. Mupirocin is highly protein-bound (> 97%), and the effect of wound secretions on the MICs of mupirocin has not been determined. 
                        Mupirocin has been shown to be active against susceptible strains of 
         
 
  S. aureus and 
         
 
  Streptococcus pyogenes, both 
         
 
  in vitro and in clinical trials (see 
         
 
  INDICATIONS AND USAGE). The following 
         
 
  in vitro data are available, 
         
 
  
                              but their clinical significance is unknown
                           . Mupirocin is active against most isolates of 
         
 
  Staphylococcus epidermidis.
