                        The vasodilating effects of isosorbide dinitrate may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety.
                        Concomitant use of isosorbide dinitrate tablets with phosphodiesterase inhibitors in any form is contraindicated (see 
                              CONTRAINDICATIONS
                           ).  
                        Concomitant use of isosorbide dinitrate tablets with riociguat, a soluable cyclase stimulator, is contraindicated (see 
                              CONTRAINDICATIONS
                           ).
