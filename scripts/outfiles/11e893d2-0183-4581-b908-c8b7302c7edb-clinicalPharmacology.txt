                  The pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered
iopamidol in normal subjects conform to an open two-compartment model
with first order elimination (a rapid alpha phase for drug distribution
and a slow beta phase for drug elimination). The elimination serum
or plasma half-life is approximately two hours; the half-life is not
dose dependent. No significant metabolism, deiodination, or biotransformation
occurs.
                  Iopamidol is
rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF);
following intrathecal administration, iopamidol appears in plasma
within one hour and virtually all of the drug reaches the systemic
circulation within 24 hours. Iopamidol is excreted mainly through
the kidneys following intrathecal administration, and the drug is
essentially undetectable in the plasma 48 hours later. In patients
with impaired renal function, the elimination half-life is prolonged
dependent upon the degree of impairment. In the absence of renal dysfunction,
the cumulative urinary excretion for iopamidol, expressed as a percentage
of administered intravenous dose is approximately 35 to 40 percent
at 60 minutes, 80 to 90 percent at 8 hours, and 90 percent or more
in the 72- to 96-hour period after administration. In normal subjects,
approximately 1 percent or less of the administered dose appears in
cumulative 72- to 96-hour fecal specimens.
                  Iopamidol displays little tendency to bind
to serum or plasma proteins.
                  No evidence of in vivo complement
activation has been found in normal subjects.
                  Animal studies indicate that iopamidol does
not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent following
intravascular administration.
