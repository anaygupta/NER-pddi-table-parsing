                     7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Quetiapine
                     
                        The risks of using SEROQUEL XR in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Given the primary CNS effects of SEROQUEL XR, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Quetiapine potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected psychotic disorders, and alcoholic beverages should be limited while taking quetiapine.
                        Quetiapine exposure is increased by the prototype CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.) and decreased by the prototype of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. John’s wort etc.) Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.
                        CYP3A4 inhibitors:
                        Coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4, resulted in significant increase in quetiapine exposure. The dose should be reduced to one sixth of the original dose in patients coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor
                                    [see Dosage and Administration and Clinical Pharmacology ].

                        CYP3A4 inducers:
                        Coadministration of quetiapine and phenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer increased the mean oral clearance of quetiapine by 5-fold.  Increased doses of SEROQUEL XR up to 5 fold may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving quetiapine and phenytoin, or other known potent CYP3A4 inducers When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of SEROQUEL XR should be reduced to the original level within 7-14 days

                        The potential effects of several concomitant medications on quetiapine pharmacokinetics were studied.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Effect of Quetiapine on Other Drugs
                     
                        Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, SEROQUEL XR may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.
                        SEROQUEL XR may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.
                        There are no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions of Seroquel on other drugs based on the CYP pathway. Seroquel and its metabolites are non-inhibitors of major metabolizing CYPs (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4).
