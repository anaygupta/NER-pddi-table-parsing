                        Renal function should be monitored carefully if high doses of aminoglycosides are to be administered with cefepime for injection because of the increased potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other cephalosporins with potent diuretics such as furosemide.
