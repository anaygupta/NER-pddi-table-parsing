                  Studies indicate allergic individuals produce immunoglobulins of the IgE class in response to exposure to allergens. Subsequent exposure to the same allergen results in a complex of allergen with IgE antibody fixed on mast cells or basophil membranes. This cross-linking results in stimulation of mast cells which leads to release and generation of pharmacologically active substances that produce immediate hypersensitivity reaction.1
