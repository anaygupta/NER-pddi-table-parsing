               Carbetapentane Citrate is a centrally acting non-narcotic antitussive.  Phenyleprine HCl is a sympathomimetic which acts predominantly on alpha receptors and have little action on beta receptors.  They therefore function as oral nasal decongestants with minimal CNS stimulation.  Guaifenesin has an expectorant action which increases the output of respiratory tract fluid by reducing adhesiveness and surface tension.  Sinus and bronchial drainage is improved and dry, nonproductive coughs become more productive and less frequent.
