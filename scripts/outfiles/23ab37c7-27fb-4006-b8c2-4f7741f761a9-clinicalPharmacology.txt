                  The synthesis of the major 
biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first 
hydroxylation of ergocalciferol takes place in the liver (to 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D) and the second in the kidneys (to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). Vitamin D 
metabolites promote the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus by the small 
intestine, thus elevating serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to 
permit bone mineralization. Vitamin D metabolites also mobilize calcium and 
phosphate from bone and probably increase the reabsorption of calcium and 
perhaps also of phosphate by the renal tubules.

                  There is a time lag of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of vitamin D 
and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis 
of the active metabolites in the liver and kidneys. Parathyroid hormone is 
responsible for the regulation of this metabolism in the kidneys.
