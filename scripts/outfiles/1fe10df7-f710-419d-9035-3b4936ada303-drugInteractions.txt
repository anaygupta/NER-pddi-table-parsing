                        Concomitant administration of Targretin capsules and gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene. Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with Targretin capsules is not recommended (see

                                 Drug-Drug Interactions
                              
                           ).
                        Coadministration of paclitaxel plus carboplatin with Targretin capsules increased bexarotene AUC by 2-fold. Caution should be excerisized when Targretin capsules are concomitantly administered with paclitaxel plus carboplatin (see 
                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: 
                                 Drug-Drug Interactions
                              
                           ).
                        Concomitant administration of Targretin capsules and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen.
                        The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin decreased by half when atorvastatin was coadministered with Targretin. This suggest that Targretin is an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and that it may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4, including oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives (see

                                 Drug-Drug Interactions
                              
                            and 
                              CONTRAINDICATIONS: 
                                 Pregnancy: Category X
                              
                           ). Thus, if treatment with Targretin capsules is intended in a woman with child-bearing potential, it is strongly recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used concurrently, one of which should be non-hormonal.
