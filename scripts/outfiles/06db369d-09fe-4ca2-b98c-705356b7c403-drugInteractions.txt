                        Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors
                        Hyperpyrexia, hypotension, and death have been reported coincident with the coadministration of MAO inhibitors and products containing dextromethorphan. In addition, MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines and may enhance the effect of pseudoephedrine. Concomitant administration of Brompheniramine Maleate, Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide Syrup and MAO inhibitors should be avoided (see 
                           CONTRAINDICATIONS).
                        Central Nervous System (CNS) depressants
                        Antihistamines have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents, etc.).
                        Antihypertensive drugs
                        Sympathomimetic may reduce the effects of antihypertensive drugs.
