                  Pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed in patients to establish the extent, if any, to which concomitant medications may alter Vizamyl image results.
                  Within a clinical study of patients with a range of cognitive impairment, some patients were receiving the following medications: donepezil, galantamine, memantine, rivastigmine. Mean cortical Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) ratios did not differ between the patients taking or not taking these concomitant medications.
