                  Pharmacokinetics
                  Following oral administration, azithromycin is rapidly absorbed 
and widely distributed throughout the body. Rapid distribution of azithromycin 
into tissues and high concentration within cells result in significantly higher 
azithromycin concentrations in tissues than in plasma or serum.
                  The pharmacokinetic parameters of azithromycin in plasma after dosing as per 
labeled recommendations in healthy young adults and asymptomatic 
HIV-seropositive adults (age 18 to 40 years old) are portrayed in the following 
chart:
                  
                  


                  


In these studies (500 mg Day 1, 250 mg Days 2 to 5), there was no significant 
difference in the disposition of azithromycin between male and female subjects. 
Plasma concentrations of azithromycin following single 500 mg oral and i.v. 
doses declined in a polyphasic pattern resulting in an average terminal 
half-life of 68 hours. With a regimen of 500 mg on Day 1 and 250 mg/day on Days 
2 to 5, Cmin and Cmax remained 
essentially unchanged from Day 2 through Day 5 of therapy. However, without a 
loading dose, azithromycin Cmin levels required 5 to 7 
days to reach steady state.
                  In asymptomatic HIV-seropositive adult subjects receiving 600 mg azithromycin 
tablets once daily for 22 days, steady-state azithromycin serum levels were 
achieved by Day 15 of dosing.
                  The absolute bioavailability of two 600 mg tablets was 34% (CV = 56%). 
Administration of two 600 mg tablets with food increased Cmax by 31% (CV = 43%) while the extent of absorption (AUC) was 
unchanged (mean ratio of AUCs = 1.00; CV = 55%).
                  The AUC of azithromycin in 250 mg capsules was unaffected by coadministration 
of an antacid containing aluminum and magnesium hydroxide with azithromycin; 
however, the Cmax was reduced by 24%. Administration of 
cimetidine (800 mg) two hours prior to azithromycin had no effect on 
azithromycin absorption.
                  When studied in healthy elderly subjects from age 65 to 85 years, the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of azithromycin (500 mg Day 1, 250 mg Days 2 to 5) in 
elderly men were similar to those in young adults; however, in elderly women, 
although higher peak concentrations (increased by 30 to 50%) were observed, no 
significant accumulation occurred.
                  The high values in adults for apparent steady-state volume of distribution 
(31.1 L/kg) and plasma clearance (630 mL/min) suggest that the prolonged 
half-life is due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from 
tissues. Selected tissue (or fluid) concentration and tissue (or fluid) to 
plasma/serum concentration ratios are shown in the following table:
                  
                  


                  


The extensive tissue distribution was confirmed by examination of additional 
tissues and fluids (bone, ejaculum, prostate, ovary, uterus, salpinx, stomach, 
liver, and gallbladder). As there are no data from adequate and well-controlled 
studies of azithromycin treatment of infections in these additional body sites, 
the clinical significance of these tissue concentration data is unknown.
                  Following a regimen of 500 mg on the first day and 250 mg daily for 4 days, 
only very low concentrations were noted in cerebrospinal fluid (less than 0.01 
mcg/mL) in the presence of non-inflamed meninges.
                  Following oral administration of a single 1200 mg dose (two 600 mg tablets), 
the mean maximum concentration in peripheral leukocytes was 140 mcg/mL. 
Concentrations remained above 32 mcg/mL for approximately 60 hr. The mean 
half-lives for 6 males and 6 females were 34 hr and 57 hr, respectively. 
Leukocyte to plasma Cmax ratios for males and females 
were 258 (± 77%) and 175 (± 60%), respectively, and the AUC ratios were 804 (± 
31%) and 541 (± 28%), respectively. The clinical relevance of these findings is 
unknown.
                  Following oral administration of multiple daily doses of 600 mg (1 
tablet/day) to asymptomatic HIV-seropositive adults, mean maximum concentration 
in peripheral leukocytes was 252 mcg/mL (± 49%). Trough concentrations in 
peripheral leukocytes at steady state averaged 146 mcg/mL (± 33%). The mean 
leukocyte to serum Cmax ratio was 456 (± 38%) and the 
mean leukocyte to serum AUC ratio was 816 (± 31%). The clinical relevance of 
these findings is unknown.
                  The serum protein binding of azithromycin is variable in the concentration 
range approximating human exposure, decreasing from 51% at 0.02 mcg/mL to 7% at 
2 mcg/mL. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly as unchanged drug, is 
a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the 
administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.
                  There are no pharmacokinetic data available from studies in hepatically- or 
renally-impaired individuals.
                  The effect of azithromycin on the plasma levels or pharmacokinetics of 
theophylline administered in multiple doses adequate to reach therapeutic 
steady-state plasma levels is not known. (See PRECAUTIONS.)1

1 High tissue concentrations should not be 
interpreted to be quantitatively related to clinical efficacy. The antimicrobial 
activity of azithromycin is pH related. Azithromycin is concentrated in cell 
lysosomes which have a low intraorganelle pH, at which the drug’s activity is 
reduced. However, the extensive distribution of drug to tissues may be relevant 
to clinical activity.
