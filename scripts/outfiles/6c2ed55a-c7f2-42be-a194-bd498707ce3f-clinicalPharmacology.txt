                        12.1  Mechanism of Action
                     
                     
                        Calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% ointment combines the pharmacological effects of calcipotriene as a synthetic vitamin D3 analogue and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic corticosteroid.
                        However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in psoriasis vulgaris are unknown.

                           Vasoconstriction:

                           In a vasoconstrictor trial, the skin blanching response of calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% ointment was consistent with that of a potent corticosteroid. 
                        
                           Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: 

                           Calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% ointment was applied once daily for 4 weeks to adult subjects (N = 12) with psoriasis vulgaris to study its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Of eleven subjects tested, none demonstrated adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level ≤ 18 mcg/dL. 
                        However in another clinical trial of calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% ointment, one subject (N = 19) demonstrated adrenal suppression. 
                        HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15-30% of the body surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of Taclonex Scalp® Topical Suspension on the scalp in combination with calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minutes post-stimulation cortisol level less than or equal to 18 mcg/dL was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment as per the recommended duration of use [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 
                        
                           Effects on Calcium Metabolism 

                           In the combination use trial described above, the effects of once daily application of calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% ointment on the body in combination with Taclonex Scalp® Topical Suspension on the scalp on calcium metabolism were also examined. Elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in 1 of 35 subjects (2.9%) after 4 weeks of treatment.

                           Absorption
                           
The systemic effect of calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% ointment in extensive psoriasis was investigated in the trial described above. In this trial, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks (maximum recommended duration of treatment) and also after 8 weeks of once daily application of calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% ointment on the body in combination with Taclonex Scalp® Topical Suspension on the scalp. Both calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29.4%) subjects at week 4 and in five of 12 (41.7%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (55.9%) subjects at week 4 and seven of 12 (58.3%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.
                        
                           Metabolism

                           
                           Calcipotriene:
                              

                           Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound. 
                        Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the α,β-unsaturated ketone analogue of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analogue). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid.
                        
                           Betamethasone dipropionate:
                              

                           Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6β-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite.
