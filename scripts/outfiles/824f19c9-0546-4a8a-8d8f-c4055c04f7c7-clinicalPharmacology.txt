                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Regorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple membrane-bound and intracellular kinases involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, tumor angiogenesis, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. In in vitro biochemical or cellular assays, regorafenib or its major human active metabolites M-2 and M-5 inhibited the activity of RET, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, KIT, PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, FGFR1, FGFR2, TIE2, DDR2, TrkA, Eph2A, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E , SAPK2, PTK5, and Abl at concentrations of regorafenib that have been achieved clinically. In in vivo models, regorafenib demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity in a rat tumor model, and inhibition of tumor growth as well as anti-metastatic activity in several mouse xenograft models including some for human colorectal carcinoma.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        
                           Absorption
                        
                        Following a single 160 mg dose of Stivarga in patients with advanced solid tumors, regorafenib reaches a geometric mean peak plasma level (Cmax) of 2.5 µg/mL at a median time of 4 hours and a geometric mean area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC) of 70.4 µg*h/mL. The AUC of regorafenib at steady-state increases less than dose proportionally at doses greater than 60 mg. At steady-state, regorafenib reaches a geometric mean Cmax of 3.9 µg/mL and a geometric mean AUC of 58.3 µg*h/mL. The coefficient of variation of AUC and Cmax is between 35% and 44%.
                        The mean relative bioavailability of tablets compared to an oral solution is 69% to 83%.
                        In a food-effect study, 24 healthy men received a single 160 mg dose of Stivarga on three separate occasions: under a fasted state, with a high-fat meal and with a low-fat meal. A high-fat meal (945 calories and 54.6 g fat) increased the mean AUC of regorafenib by 48% and decreased the mean AUC of the M-2 and M-5 metabolites by 20% and 51%, respectively, as compared to the fasted state. A low-fat meal (319 calories and 8.2 g fat) increased the mean AUC of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 by 36%, 40% and 23%, respectively as compared to fasted conditions. Stivarga was administered with a low-fat meal in Studies 1 and 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Studies (14)].
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Distribution
                           
                           
                              Regorafenib undergoes enterohepatic circulation with multiple plasma concentration peaks observed across the 24-hour dosing interval. Regorafenib is highly bound (99.5%) to human plasma proteins.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Metabolism
                           
                           
                              Regorafenib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and UGT1A9. The main circulating metabolites of regorafenib measured at steady-state in human plasma are M-2 (N-oxide) and M-5 (N-oxide and N-desmethyl), both of them having similar in vitro pharmacological activity and steady-state concentrations as regorafenib. M-2 and M-5 are highly protein bound (99.8% and 99.95%, respectively).

                              Following a single 160 mg oral dose of Stivarga, the geometric mean (range) elimination half-lives for regorafenib and the M-2 metabolite in plasma are 28 hours (14 to 58 hours) and 25 hours (14 to 32 hours), respectively. M-5 has a longer mean (range) elimination half-life of 51 hours (32 to 70 hours).
                              Approximately 71% of a radiolabeled dose was excreted in feces (47% as parent compound, 24% as metabolites) and 19% of the dose was excreted in urine (17% as glucuronides) within 12 days after administration of a radiolabeled oral solution at a dose of 120 mg.

                              Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there is no clinically relevant effect of age, gender or weight on the pharmacokinetics of regorafenib.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Hepatic Impairment
                           
                           
                              The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib, M-2, and M-5 was evaluated in 14 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A); 4 patients with HCC and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B); and 10 patients with solid tumors and normal hepatic function after the administration of a single 100 mg dose of Stivarga. No clinically important differences in the mean exposure of regorafenib, M-2, or M-5 were observed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared to the patients with normal hepatic function. The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Renal Impairment
                           
                           
                              The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib, M-2, and M-5 was evaluated in 10 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60-89 mL/min) and 18 patients with normal renal function following the administration of Stivarga at a dose of 160 mg daily for 21 days. No differences in the mean steady-state exposure of regorafenib, M-2, or M-5 were observed in patients with mild renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Limited pharmacokinetic data are available from patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30-59 mL/min). The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.

                                 Effect of Regorafenib on Cytochrome P450 Substrates: In vitro studies suggested that regorafenib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19; M-2 metabolite is an inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and M-5 metabolite is an inhibitor of CYP2C8. In vitro studies suggested that regorafenib is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme activity.
                              Patients with advanced solid tumors received single oral doses of CYP substrates, 2 mg of midazolam (CYP3A4), 40 mg of omeprazole (CYP2C19) and 10 mg of warfarin (CYP2C9) or 4 mg of rosiglitazone (CYP2C8) one week before and two weeks after Stivarga at a dose of 160 mg once daily. No clinically relevant change was observed in the mean AUC of rosiglitazone (N=12) or the mean omeprazole (N=11) plasma concentrations measured 6 hours after dosing or the mean AUC of midazolam (N=15). The mean AUC of warfarin (N=8) increased by 25% [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
                              
                                 Effect of CYP3A4 Strong Inducers on Regorafenib: Twenty-two healthy men received a single 160 mg dose of Stivarga alone and then 7 days after starting rifampin. Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, was administered at a dose of 600 mg daily for 9 days. The mean AUC of regorafenib decreased by 50% and mean AUC of M-5 increased by 264%. No change in the mean AUC of M-2 was observed [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
                              
                                 Effect of CYP3A4 Strong Inhibitors on Regorafenib: Eighteen healthy men received a single 160 mg dose of Stivarga alone and then 5 days after starting ketoconazole. Ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, was administered at a dose of 400 mg daily for 18 days. The mean AUC of regorafenib increased by 33% and the mean AUC of M-2 and M-5 both decreased by 93% [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].
                              
                                 Effect of Regorafenib on UGT1A1 Substrates: In vitro studies showed that regorafenib, M-2, and M-5 competitively inhibit UGT1A9 and UGT1A1 at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Eleven patients received irinotecan-containing combination chemotherapy with Stivarga at a dose of 160 mg. The mean AUC of irinotecan increased 28% and the mean AUC of SN-38 increased by 44% when irinotecan was administered 5 days after the last of 7 daily doses of Stivarga.
