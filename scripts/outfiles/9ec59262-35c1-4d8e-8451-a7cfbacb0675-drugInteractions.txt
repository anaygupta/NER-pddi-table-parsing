                     Admixtures of BabyBIG with other drugs have not been evaluated. It is recommended that BabyBIG be administered separately from other drugs or medications that the patient may be receiving [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)
                        ].
                     Antibodies present in immune globulin preparations may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines such as polio, measles, mumps, and rubella; THEREFORE, VACCINATION WITH LIVE VIRUS VACCINES SHOULD BE DEFERRED UNTIL APPROXIMATELY THREE OR MORE MONTHS AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF BabyBIG. If such vaccinations were given shortly before or after BabyBIG administration, revaccination may be necessary.
