                  Mechanism of Action

                  The mechanism of action of trimethobenzamide hydrochloride capsules, USP as determined in animals is obscure, but may involve the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), an area in the medulla oblongata through which emetic impluses are conveyed to the vomiting center; direct impulses to the vomiting center are not similarily inhibited. In dogs pretreated with trimethobenzamide HCl, the emetic response to apomorphine is inhibited, while little or not protection is afforded against emesis induced by intragastric copper sulfate.
