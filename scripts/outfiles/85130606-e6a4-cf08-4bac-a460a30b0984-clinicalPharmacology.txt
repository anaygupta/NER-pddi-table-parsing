                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        TECHNIVIE combines two direct-acting hepatitis C virus antiviral agents with distinct mechanisms of action [see Microbiology (12.4)].
                        Ritonavir is not active against HCV. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that increases peak and trough plasma drug concentrations of paritaprevir and overall drug exposure (i.e., area under the curve).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        
                           Cardiac Electrophysiology
                        
                        The effect of a combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir plus dasabuvir on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double blind, placebo and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) 4-way crossover thorough QT study in 60 healthy subjects. At concentrations approximately 6 and 1.8 times the therapeutic concentrations of paritaprevir and ombitasvir, the combination did not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        
                           Absorption
                        
                        Ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir were absorbed after oral administration with mean Tmax of approximately 4 to 5 hours. While ombitasvir exposures increased in a dose proportional manner, paritaprevir and ritonavir exposures increased in a more than dose proportional manner. Accumulation is minimal for ombitasvir and approximately 1.5- to 2-fold for ritonavir and paritaprevir. Steady state exposures are achieved after approximately 12 days of dosing.
                        The absolute bioavailability of ombitasvir and paritaprevir when administered with ritonavir as TECHNIVIE was approximately 48.1% and 52.6%, respectively.
                        Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the median steady-state AUC0-24 for ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir were 1239, 2276 and 6072 ng·hr/mL, respectively, when administered to HCV genotype 4-infected subjects. Median steady-state Cmax for ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir were 82, 194 and 543 ng/mL, respectively, when administered to HCV genotype 4-infected subjects.
                        
                           Effects of Food on Oral Absorption
                        
                        Relative to fasting conditions, administration of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir with a moderate fat meal (approximately 600 Kcal, 20-30% calories from fat) increased the mean AUC by 82%, 211% and 49%, respectively.
                        Relative to fasting conditions, administration of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir with a high fat meal (approximately 900 Kcal, 60% calories from fat) increased the mean AUC by 76%, 180%, and 44%, respectively.
                        Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir should always be administered with a meal.
                        
                           Distribution 
                        
                        
                           Ombitasvir: Ombitasvir was approximately 99.9% bound to human plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.09 to 9 µg per mL. The mean blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was 0.49. The volume of distribution (V) was 173 L.
                        
                           Paritaprevir: Paritaprevir was approximately 97 to 98.6% bound to human plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.08 to 8 µg per mL. The mean blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was 0.7. The volume of distribution (V) was 103 L.
                        
                           Ritonavir: Ritonavir was greater than 99% bound to human plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.007 to 22 µg per mL.  The mean blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was 0.6.
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        
                           Ombitasvir: Ombitasvir is predominantly metabolized by amide hydrolysis followed by oxidative metabolism.
                        
                           Paritaprevir: Paritaprevir is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5.
                        
                           Ritonavir: Ritonavir is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6.
                        
                           Elimination
                        
                        
                           Ombitasvir: Following a single dose administration of 14C-ombitasvir, approximately 90.2% of the radioactivity was recovered in feces with limited radioactivity (1.91%) in urine; unchanged ombitasvir accounted for 87.8% of the radioactivity in the feces and 0.03% in the urine. The mean elimination half-life of ombitasvir was approximately 21 to 25 hours.
                        
                           Paritaprevir: Following a single dose administration of 14C-paritaprevir co-dosed with 100 mg of ritonavir, approximately 88% of the radioactivity was recovered in feces with limited radioactivity (8.8%) in urine; unchanged paritaprevir accounted for 1.1% of the radioactivity in the feces and 0.05% in the urine. The mean plasma half-life of paritaprevir was approximately 5.5 hours.
                        
                           Ritonavir: Following dosing of ritonavir with ombitasvir and  paritaprevir, mean plasma half-life of ritonavir was approximately 4 hours. Following a single 600 mg dose of 14C-ritonavir oral solution, 86.4% of the radioactivity was recovered in the feces and 11.3% of the dose was excreted in the urine.
                        Ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir do not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo and, based on in vitro data, are not expected to inhibit organic cation transporter (OCT2), organic anion transporter (OAT3), or multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at clinically relevant concentrations.
                        Ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir are neither inhibitors nor substrates of organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1).

                           Hepatic Impairment
                        
                        The single dose pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and another antiviral drug were evaluated in non-HCV infected subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A; score of 5-6), moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B, score of 7-9) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, score of 10-15).
                        Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir mean AUC values decreased by 8%, 29% and 34%, respectively, in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. 
                        Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, ombitasvir and ritonavir mean AUC values decreased by 30% and 30%, respectively and paritaprevir mean AUC values increased by 62% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. 
                        Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, paritaprevir and ritonavir mean AUC values increased by 945% and 13% respectively and ombitasvir mean AUC values decreased by 54% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment.
                        
                           Renal Impairment
                        
                        The single dose pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir were evaluated in non-HCV infected subjects with mild (CLcr: 60 to 89 mL/min), moderate (CLcr: 30 to 59 mL/min), and severe (CLcr: 15 to 29 mL/min) renal impairment.
                        Overall, changes in exposure of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir in non-HCV infected subjects with mild-, moderate- and severe renal impairment are not expected to be clinically relevant. Pharmacokinetic data are not available on the use of TECHNIVIE in non-HCV infected subjects with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).
                        Relative to subjects with normal renal function, ritonavir AUC values increased by 40%, while ombitasvir and paritaprevir AUC values were unchanged in subjects with mild renal impairment.
                        Relative to subjects with normal renal function, ritonavir AUC values increased by 76%, while ombitasvir and paritaprevir AUC values were unchanged in subjects with moderate renal impairment.
                        Relative to subjects with normal renal function, paritaprevir and ritonavir AUC values increased by 25% and 108%, respectively, while ombitasvir AUC values were unchanged in subjects with severe renal impairment.

                           Mechanism of Action 
                        
                        TECHNIVIE combines two direct-acting antiviral agents with distinct mechanisms of action and non-overlapping resistance profiles to target HCV at multiple steps in the viral lifecycle.
                        
                           Ombitasvir
                        
                        Ombitasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral RNA replication and virion assembly. The mechanism of action of ombitasvir has been characterized based on cell culture antiviral activity and drug resistance mapping studies.
                        
                           Paritaprevir
                        
                        Paritaprevir is an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease which is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and is essential for viral replication. In a biochemical assay, paritaprevir inhibited the proteolytic activity of a recombinant HCV genotype 4a NS3/4A protease enzyme with an IC50 value of 0.16 nM. Paritaprevir inhibited the activity of NS3/4A enzymes from single isolates of genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3a with IC50 values of 0.18 nM, 0.43 nM, 2.4 nM, 6.3 nM, and 14.5 nM, respectively.
                        
                           Antiviral Activity
                        
                        
                           Ombitasvir
                        
                        The EC50 values of ombitasvir against HCV replicons containing NS5A from a single isolate each of genotype 4a and genotype 4d were 1.7 pM and 0.38 pM, respectively. Ombitasvir had a median EC50 value of 0.21 pM (range 0.10 pM to 0.36 pM; n=9) against transient HCV replicons containing NS5A genes from a panel of genotype 4a isolates from treatment-naïve subjects. Ombitasvir had EC50 values of 14 pM, 5.0 pM, 12 pM, 4.3 pM, 19 pM, 3.2 pM, and 366 pM against replicon cell lines representing genotypes 1a-H77, 1b-Con1, 2a, 2b, 3a, 5a and 6a, respectively.
                        
                           Paritaprevir
                        
                        The EC50 values of paritaprevir against HCV replicons containing NS3 from a single isolate each of genotype 4a and genotype 4d were 0.09 nM and 0.015 nM, respectively. Paritaprevir had EC50 values of 1.0 nM, 0.21 nM, 5.3 nM, 19 nM and 0.68 nM against replicon cell lines representing genotypes 1a-H77, 1b-Con1, 2a-JFH1, 3a and 6a, respectively.
                        
                           Ritonavir
                        
                        In HCV replicon cell culture assays, ritonavir did not exhibit a direct antiviral effect and the presence of ritonavir did not affect the antiviral activity of paritaprevir.
                        
                           Resistance
                        
                        
                           In Cell Culture
                        
                        Exposure of HCV genotype 4a replicons to ombitasvir or paritaprevir resulted in the emergence of drug resistant replicons carrying amino acid substitutions in NS5A or NS3, respectively. Amino acid substitutions in NS5A or NS3 selected in cell culture or identified in clinical study PEARL-I were phenotypically characterized in genotype 4 replicons.
                        For ombitasvir, in an HCV genotype 4a replicon, NS5A substitution L28V reduced ombitasvir antiviral activity by 21-fold. In an HCV genotype 4d replicon, substitutions L28V alone and L28V in combination with T58S reduced ombitasvir antiviral activity by 310- and 760-fold, respectively. Ombitasvir activity against an HCV genotype 4d replicon was not reduced by a T58P polymorphism, which represents the consensus sequence observed at this position for HCV genotype 4a and 4d subjects in PEARL-I.
                        For paritaprevir, in an HCV genotype 4a replicon, NS3 substitutions R155C, A156T/V, and D168H/V reduced paritaprevir antiviral activity by 40- to 323-fold. In an HCV genotype 4d replicon, NS3 substitutions Y56H and D168V reduced paritaprevir antiviral activity by 8- and 313-fold, respectively, while a combination of Y56H and D168V reduced the activity of paritaprevir by 12,533-fold.
                        
                           In Clinical Studies
                        
                        In the clinical study PEARL-I, three subjects with HCV genotype 4 infection experienced virologic failure (2 post-treatment relapse, 1 on-treatment failure). All 3 virologic failures were observed in a regimen containing paritaprevir/ritonavir and ombitasvir without ribavirin. Treatment-emergent, resistance-associated substitutions were detected at the time of failure in all 3 subjects and included D168V (with or without Y56H) in NS3, and L28S and L28V (with or without M31I or T58S) in NS5A.
                        
                           Persistence of Resistance-Associated Substitutions
                        
                        The persistence of ombitasvir or paritaprevir resistance-associated amino acid substitutions in NS5A or NS3, respectively, in HCV genotype 4 has not been studied. In HCV genotype 1, persistence of ombitasvir and paritaprevir resistance-associated substitutions through 24 or 48 weeks post-treatment has been observed in subjects who experienced virologic failure with ombitasvir- and paritaprevir-containing regimens. The long-term clinical impact of the emergence or persistence of virus containing ombitasvir or paritaprevir resistance-associated substitutions is unknown.
                        
                           Effect of Baseline HCV Polymorphisms on Treatment Response
                        
                        Phylogenetic analysis of HCV sequences from genotype 4-infected subjects in the clinical study PEARL-I, identified 7 HCV genotype 4 subtypes (4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4f, 4g/4k, 4o). Most subjects were infected with either subtype 4a (38%) or 4d (52%); 1 to 7 subjects were infected with each of the  other genotype 4 subtypes. Among subjects enrolled at U.S. study sites, 16/18 (89%) were infected with HCV subtype 4a; one subject each was infected with subtype 4c or 4d.  Three subjects who experienced virologic failure with the regimen containing paritaprevir/ritonavir and ombitasvir without ribavirin were infected with HCV subtype 4d.
                        Baseline HCV polymorphisms are not expected to impact the likelihood of achieving SVR when TECHNIVIE is used as recommended to treat HCV genotype 4 infected patients, based on the low virologic failure rate observed in PEARL-I.
                        
                           Cross-resistance
                        
                        Cross-resistance may occur among NS5A inhibitors and among NS3/4A protease inhibitors within each individual class. The impact of prior ombitasvir or paritaprevir treatment experience on the efficacy of other NS5A inhibitors or NS3/4A protease inhibitors has not been studied. Similarly, the efficacy of TECHNIVIE has not been studied in subjects who have failed prior treatment with another NS5A inhibitor, NS3/4A protease inhibitor, or NS5B inhibitor.
