               Drug Interactions: The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs: amantadine,antiarrhythmic agents of class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO page 3 of 4 inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and otherdrugs having anticholinergic activity.Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressuremay be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. (See also CONTRAINDICATIONS.)Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms ofdigoxin; increased serum digoxin concentrations may result. Anticholinergic drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that altergastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents,simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.The inhibiting effects of anticholinergic drugs on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treatachlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion.Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: There are no known human data on long-term potential for carcinogenicityor mutagenicity.Long-term studies in animals to determine carcinogenic potential are not known to have been conducted.In studies in rats at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day, dicyclomine hydrochloride produced no deleterious effects on breeding, conception,or parturition.
