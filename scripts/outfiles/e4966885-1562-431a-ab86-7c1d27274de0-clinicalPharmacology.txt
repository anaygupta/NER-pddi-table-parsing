                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The mechanism of action of omega-3-acid ethyl esters is not completely understood. Potential mechanisms of action include inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase, increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation in the liver, decreased lipogenesis in the liver, and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. Omega-3-acid ethyl esters may reduce the synthesis of triglycerides in the liver because EPA and DHA are poor substrates for the enzymes responsible for TG synthesis, and EPA and DHA inhibit esterification of other fatty acids.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        In healthy volunteers and in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia, EPA and DHA were absorbed when administered as ethyl esters orally. Omega-3-acids administered as ethyl esters (omega-3-acid ethyl esters) induced significant, dose-dependent increases in serum phospholipid EPA content, though increases in DHA content were less marked and not dose-dependent when administered as ethyl esters.
                        
                           Specific Populations: 
                        
                        
                           Age: Uptake of EPA and DHA into serum phospholipids in subjects treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters was independent of age (<49 years versus ≥49 years). 
                        
                           Gender: Females tended to have more uptake of EPA into serum phospholipids than males. The clinical significance of this is unknown. 
                        
                           Pediatric: Pharmacokinetics of omega-3-acid ethyl esters have not been studied.
                        
                           Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Omega-3-acid ethyl esters have not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
                        
                           Drug-Drug Interactions: 
                        
                        
                           Simvastatin: 
                        
                        In a 14-day trial of 24 healthy adult subjects, daily coadministration of simvastatin 80 mg with omega-3-acid ethyl esters 4 grams did not affect the extent (AUC) or rate (Cmax) of exposure to simvastatin or the major active metabolite, beta-hydroxy simvastatin at steady state.
                        
                           Atorvastatin: 
                        
                        In a 14-day trial of 50 healthy adult subjects, daily coadministration of atorvastatin 80 mg with omega-3-acid ethyl esters 4 grams did not affect AUC or Cmax of exposure to atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 4-hydroxyatorvastatin at steady state. 
                        
                           Rosuvastatin: 
                        
                        In a 14-day trial of 48 healthy adult subjects, daily coadministration of rosuvastatin 40 mg with omega-3-acid ethyl esters 4 grams did not affect AUC or Cmax of exposure to rosuvastatin at steady state. 
                        
                           In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that clinically significant cytochrome P450 mediated inhibition by EPA/DHA combinations are not expected in humans. .
