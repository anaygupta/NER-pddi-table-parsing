                  BENZONATATE acts peripherally by anesthetizing the stretch receptors located in the respiratory passages, lungs, and pleura by dampening their activity and thereby reducing the cough reflex at its source. It begins to act within 15 to 20 minutes and its effect lasts for 3 to 8 hours. BENZONATATE has no inhibitory effect on the respiratory center in recommended dosage.
