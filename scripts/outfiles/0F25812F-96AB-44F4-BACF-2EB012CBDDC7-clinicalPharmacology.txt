CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Naphazoline constricts the vascular system of the conjunctiva. It is presumed that this effect is due to direct stimulation action of the drug upon the alpha adrenergic receptors in the arterioles of the conjunctiva resulting in decreased conjunctival congestion. Naphalozine belongs to the imidazoline class of sympathomimetics.
