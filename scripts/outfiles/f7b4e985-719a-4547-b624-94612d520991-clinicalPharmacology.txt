                        Pharmacokinetics:
                      In an open label, parallel group study of 24 patients with acne vulgaris, once-daily topical administration of approximately 3-12 grams/day of 
                        Clindagel®
                        
                      for five days resulted in peak plasma clindamycin concentrations that were less than 5.5 ng/mL.
                  Following multiple applications of C
                        lindagel®
                        
                      less than 0.04% of the total dose was excreted in the urine.
                  
                     
                        Microbiology:

                      hydrolysis converts this compound to clindamycin which has antibacterial activity. Clindamycin inhibits bacteria protien synthesis at the ribosomal level by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit and affecting the process of peptide chain initiation. 
                        In vitro
                      studies indicated that clindamycin inhibited all tested

                      cultures at a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.4 µg/mL. Cross-resistance has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin.
