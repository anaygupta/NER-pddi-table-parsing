                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        
						Cystadane acts as a methyl group donor in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine in patients with homocystinuria.  
						Cystadane occurs naturally in the body.  It is a metabolite of choline and is present in small amounts in foods such as beets, spinach, cereals, and seafood.
						
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        
						Cystadane was observed to lower plasma homocysteine levels in three types of homocystinuria, including CBS deficiency; MTHFR deficiency; and cbl defect.  
						Patients have taken Cystadane for many years without evidence of tolerance.  There has been no demonstrated correlation between Cystadane levels and homocysteine levels.

                           

						In CBS-deficient patients, large increases in methionine levels over baseline have been observed.  Cystadane has also been demonstrated to increase low plasma methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels in patients with MTHFR deficiency and cbl defect.
						
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        
						Pharmacokinetic studies of Cystadane are not available.  Plasma levels of Cystadane have not been measured in patients and have not been correlated to homocysteine levels.
