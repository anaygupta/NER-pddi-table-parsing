                  Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 
                  Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. 
                  Their synthetic analogs are primarily used for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. When injected intra-articularly, triamcinolone hexacetonide can be expected to be absorbed slowly from the injection site.
