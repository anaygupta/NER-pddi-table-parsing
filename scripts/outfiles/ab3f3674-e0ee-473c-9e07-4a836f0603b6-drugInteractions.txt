                        Cyclobenzaprine may have life threatening interactions with MAO inhibitors (see 
                              CONTRAINDICATIONS
                           ). Post-marketing cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride and other drugs, such as SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, tramadol, bupropion, meperidine, verapamil, or MAO inhibitors. If concomitant treatment with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, careful observation is advised, particularly during treatment initiation or dose increases (see 
                              WARNINGS
                           ).
                        Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.
                        Tricyclic antidepressants may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds.
                        Tricyclic antidepressants may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking tramadol.ULTRAM® (tramadol HCl tablets, PriCara, Division of Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
