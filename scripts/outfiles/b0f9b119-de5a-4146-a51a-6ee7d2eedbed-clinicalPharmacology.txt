                  Isosulfan Blue has no known pharmacologic action.  Following subcutaneous administration, Isosulfan blue 1% is selectively picked up by the lymphatic vessels.  Thus, the lymphatic vessels are delineated by a bright blue color making them discernible from surrounding tissue.  There is some evidence that 50% of the isosulfan blue, from aqueous solution, is weakly bound to serum protein (albumin).  Since interstitial protein is presumed to be carried almost exclusively by lymphtics, and in view of evidence of binding of dyes to proteins, visualization may be due to protein binding phenomenon.
