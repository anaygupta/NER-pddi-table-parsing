                  Pyrimethamine is well absorbed with peak levels occurring between
                            2 to 6 hours following administration. It is eliminated slowly
                            and has a plasma half-life of approximately 96 hours.
                            Pyrimethamine is 87% bound to human plasma proteins.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           Microbiology:  Pyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist and the
                                    rationale for its therapeutic action is based on the
                                    differential requirement between host and parasite for nucleic
                                    acid precursors involved in growth. This activity is highly
                                    selective against plasmodia and Toxoplasma gondii. 
                        
                        Pyrimethamine possesses blood schizonticidal and some
                                    tissue schizonticidal activity against malaria parasites of
                                    humans. However, the 4-amino-quinoline compounds are more
                                    effective against the erythrocytic schizonts. It does not
                                    destroy gametocytes, but arrests sporogony in the mosquito. 
                        The action of pyrimethamine against Toxoplasma gondii is greatly
                                    enhanced when used in conjunction with sulfonamides. This was
                                    demonstrated by Eyles and Coleman1 in the treatment
                                    of experimental toxoplasmosis in the mouse. Jacobs et
                                    al2 demonstrated that combination of the
                                    2 drugs effectively prevented the development of severe
                                    uveitis in most rabbits following the inoculation of the
                                    anterior chamber of the eye with toxoplasma.
