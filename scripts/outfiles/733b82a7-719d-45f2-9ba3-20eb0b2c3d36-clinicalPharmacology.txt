                  Silver sulfadiazine has broad antimicrobial activity.  It is bactericidal for many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as being effective against yeast.Â  Results from in vitro testing are listed below.  Sufficient data have been obtained to demonstrate that silver sulfadiazine will inhibit bacteria that are resistant to other antimicrobial agents and that the compound is superior to sulfadiazine. 
                  Studies utilizing radioactive micronized silver sulfadiazine, electron microscopy, and biochemical techniques have revealed that the mechanism of action of silver sulfadiazine on bacteria differs from silver nitrate and sodium sulfadiazine.  Silver sulfadiazine acts only on the cell wall to produce its bactericidal effect.
                  


                  


Silver sulfadiazine is not a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and may be useful in situations where such agents are contraindicated.
