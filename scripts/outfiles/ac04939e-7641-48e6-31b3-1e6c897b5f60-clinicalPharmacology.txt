                  Glycine is an amino acid and a nonelectrolyte. A solution
of glycine in water is therefore nonconductive and suitable for urologic irrigation
during electrosurgical procedures. A 1.5% concentration of glycine in
water (200 mOsmol/liter calc.) is sufficient to minimize the risk of intravascular
hemolysis which can occur from absorption of plain water through open prostatic
veins during transurethral resection (TUR). It is hypotonic in relation to
the extracellular fluid (280 mOsmol/liter). Any solution absorbed intravascularly
during transurethral prostatic or bladder surgery, although variable in amount
depending primarily on the extent of surgery, will be excreted by the kidney.
Studies have shown that the absorption of glycine does not cause significant
hemolysis (increase of free hemoglobin) or release significant amounts of
free ammonia in the blood. Glycine is rapidly degraded in the liver by glycine
oxidase.
                  Water is an essential constituent of all body
tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal
adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters
each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).
                  Water
balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution
depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments
and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic
equilibrium.
