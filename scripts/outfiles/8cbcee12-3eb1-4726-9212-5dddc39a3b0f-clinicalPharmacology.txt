                     Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in 
patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma 
glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes 
of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose 
production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin 
sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike 
sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with 
type 2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see 
                              PRECAUTIONS
                           ) and does not cause 
hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged 
while fasting plasma insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may 
actually decrease.
