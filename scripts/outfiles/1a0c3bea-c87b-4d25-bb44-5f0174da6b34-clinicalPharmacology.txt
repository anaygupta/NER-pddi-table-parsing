                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        
                           In vitro biochemical and/or cellular assays have shown that cabozantinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of RET, MET, VEGFR-1, -2 and -3, KIT, TRKB, FLT-3, AXL, and TIE-2. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        A population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib was performed using data collected from 289 patients with solid tumors including MTC following oral administration of 140 mg daily doses. The predicted effective half-life is approximately 55 hours, the oral volume of distribution (V/F) is approximately 349 L, and the clearance (CL/F) at steady-state is estimated to be 4.4 L/hr.
                        
                           Absorption and Distribution
                        
                        Following oral administration of COMETRIQ, median time to peak cabozantinib plasma concentrations (Tmax) ranged from 2 to 5 hours post-dose. Repeat daily dosing of COMETRIQ at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in 4- to 5-fold mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady state was achieved by Day 15. Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in human plasma (≥ 99.7%).
                        A high-fat meal increased Cmax and AUC values by 41% and 57%, respectively relative to fasted conditions in healthy subjects administered a single 140 mg oral COMETRIQ dose.
                        
                           Metabolism and Elimination
                        
                        Cabozantinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 in vitro. Inhibition of CYP3A4 reduced the formation of the XL184 N-oxide metabolite by >80%. Inhibition of CYP2C9 had a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation (i.e., a <20% reduction). Inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation.
                        Within a 48-day collection period after a single dose of 14C-cabozantinib in healthy subjects, approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered with 54% in feces and 27% in urine.
                        
                           Specific Populations
                        
                        
                           Renal Impairment: No formal pharmacokinetic study of cabozantinib has been conducted in patients with renal impairment. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance value ≥30 mL/min) does not have a
clinically relevant effect on the clearance of cabozantinib.
                        
                           Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
                        
                           Pediatric Population: The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib has not been studied in the pediatric population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
                        
                        
                           Effects of Age, Gender and Race: A population PK analysis did not identify clinically relevant differences in clearance of cabozantinib between females and males or between Whites (89%) and non-Whites (11%). Cabozantinib pharmacokinetics was not affected by age (20-86 years).
                        
                           Drug Interactions
                        
                        
                           CYP Enzyme Inhibition and Induction: Cabozantinib is a noncompetitive inhibitor of CYP2C8 (Kiapp = 4.6 μM), a mixed-type inhibitor of both CYP2C9 (Kiapp = 10.4 μM) and CYP2C19 (Kiapp = 28.8 μM), and a weak competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 (estimated Kiapp = 282 μM) in human liver microsomal (HLM) preparations. IC50 values >20 μM were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 isozymes in both recombinant and HLM assay systems.
                        Cabozantinib is an inducer of CYP1A1 mRNA in human hepatocyte incubations (i.e., 75-100% of CYP1A1 positive control β-naphthoflavone induction), but not of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 mRNA or isozyme-associated enzyme activities.
                        Cabozantinib at steady-state plasma concentrations (≥100 mg/day daily for a minimum of 21 days) showed no effect on single-dose rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC) in patients with solid tumors.
                        
                           P-glycoprotein Inhibition: Cabozantinib is an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-gp transport activities in a bi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.6 Cardiac Electrophysiology
                     
                        The effect of orally administered COMETRIQ 140 mg on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in patients with MTC. A mean increase in QTcF of 10 - 15 ms was observed at 4 weeks after initiating COMETRIQ. A concentration-QTc relationship could not be definitively established. Changes in cardiac wave form morphology or new rhythms were not observed. No COMETRIQ-treated patients had a QTcF > 500 ms [see Clinical Studies (14)].
