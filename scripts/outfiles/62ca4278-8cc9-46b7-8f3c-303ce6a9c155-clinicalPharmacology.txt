                  Following intravenous injection, radioiodinated albumin human is uniformly
                  distributed throughout the intravascular pool within 10 minutes; extravascular
                  distribution takes place more slowly. Iodinated I 131 albumin can also be detected in
                  the lymph and in certain body tissues within 10 minutes after injection but maximum 
                  distribution of radioactivity throughout the extravascular space does not occur until
                  two to four days after administration.  The time at which extravascular activity is 
                  maximal has been designated as the "equilibrium time". When this point has been
                  reached, the radioactivity remaining in the intravascular and extravascular spaces
                  decreases slowly and exponentially in parallel fashion.
                      The administered radioactivity is eliminated almost entirely in the urine, only about
                  2 percent of the total dose ultimately appearing in the feces.
                      The biologic half-life of Iodinated I 131 albumin is dependent upon a number of 
                  factors, and published studies have varied considerably in their reporting of this 
                  figure. It has ranged, in the literature, from below 10 days to over 20 days. One
                  important factor affecting the biological half-life is the initial rate of excretion, and this
                  depends in part on the quality of the Iodinated I 131 albumin. With Megatope, the 
                  biologic half-life in normal individuals has been reported to be approximately 14 days.`
