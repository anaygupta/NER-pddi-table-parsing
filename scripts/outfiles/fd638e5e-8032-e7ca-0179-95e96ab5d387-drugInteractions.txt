                     Effect of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors
and Inducers
                     
Oral administration of a P-gp inhibitor
(ritonavir at 200 mg twice daily) 1 hour before administration of
GILOTRIF increased systemic exposure to afatinib by 48%.  There was
no change in afatinib exposure when ritonavir was administered simultaneously
with or 6 hours after GILOTRIF. Concomitant taking of P-gp inhibitors
(including but not limited to ritonavir, cyclosporine A, ketoconazole,
itraconazole, erythromycin, verapamil, quinidine, tacrolimus, nelfinavir,
saquinavir, and amiodarone) with GILOTRIF can increase exposure to
afatinib [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  
                  Co-administration with oral dose of a P-gp inducer (rifampicin
at 600 mg once daily for 7 days) decreased exposure to afatinib by
34%. Concomitant taking of P-gp inducers (including but not limited
to rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and St. John’s
Wort) with GILOTRIF can decrease exposure to afatinib [see
Dosage and Administration (2.3) and
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Co-administration of P-gp inhibitors can increase
afatinib exposure. Reduce GILOTRIF by 10 mg per day if not tolerated.
Co-administration of chronic P-gp inducers orally can decrease afatinib
exposure. Increase GILOTRIF by 10 mg per day as tolerated. (2.3, 7)
