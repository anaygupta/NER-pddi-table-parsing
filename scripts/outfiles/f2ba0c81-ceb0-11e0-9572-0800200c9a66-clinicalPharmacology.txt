                     12.1  Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Endogenous pulmonary surfactant lowers surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveolar surfaces during respiration and stabilizes the alveoli against collapse at resting transpulmonary pressures.  A deficiency of pulmonary surfactant in premature infants results in RDS.  SURFAXIN compensates for the deficiency of surfactant and restores surface activity to the lungs of these infants.

                        Lucinactant lowers minimum surface tension to â‰¤ 6 dynes per cm, as assessed by the pulsating bubble surfactometer.

                        Lucinactant improves lung compliance and respiratory gas exchange in premature fetal rabbits, lambs and non-human primates with RDS under experimental conditions with controlled airflow and oxygen pressure.  The clinical relevance of these animal findings to humans is unknown.

                        SURFAXIN is administered directly to the lung, where biophysical effects occur at the terminal airways and alveolar surface.  No human pharmacokinetic studies have been performed to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination of SURFAXIN.
