                        No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dipyridamole tablets. The following information was obtained from the literature.
                        Adenosine
                        Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary.
                        Cholinesterase Inhibitors
                        Dipyridamole may counteract the antcholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis.
