                     12.1 	Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Ruxolitinib, a kinase inhibitor, inhibits Janus Associated Kinases (JAKs) JAK1 and JAK2 which mediate the signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for hematopoiesis and immune function. JAK signaling involves recruitment of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) to cytokine receptors, activation and subsequent localization of STATs to the nucleus leading to modulation of gene expression.
                        Myelofibrosis (MF) and polycythemia vera (PV) are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) known to be associated with dysregulated JAK1 and JAK2 signaling. In a mouse model of JAK2V617F-positive MPN, oral administration of ruxolitinib prevented splenomegaly, preferentially decreased JAK2V617F mutant cells in the spleen and decreased circulating inflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-α, IL-6).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Ruxolitinib inhibits cytokine induced STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood from healthy subjects and MF and PV patients. Jakafi administration resulted in maximal inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation 2 hours after dosing which returned to near baseline by 10 hours in both healthy subjects and MF and PV patients.

                           Absorption
                        
                        In clinical studies, ruxolitinib is rapidly absorbed after oral Jakafi administration with maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) achieved within 1 to 2 hours post-dose. Based on a mass balance study in humans, oral absorption of ruxolitinib was estimated to be at least 95%. Mean ruxolitinib Cmax and total exposure (AUC) increased proportionally over a single dose range of 5 to 200 mg. There were no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib upon administration of Jakafi with a high-fat meal, with the mean Cmax moderately decreased (24%) and the mean AUC nearly unchanged (4% increase).
                        
                           Distribution
                        
                        The mean volume of distribution at steady-state is 72 L in MF patients with an associated inter-subject variability of 29% and 75 L in PV patients with an associated inter-subject variability of 23%. Binding to plasma proteins in vitro is approximately 97%, mostly to albumin. 
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        
                           In vitro studies suggest that ruxolitinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9.
                        
                           Elimination
                        
                        Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled ruxolitinib in healthy adult subjects, elimination was predominately through metabolism with 74% of radioactivity excreted in urine and 22% excretion via feces. Unchanged drug accounted for less than 1% of the excreted total radioactivity. The mean elimination half-life of ruxolitinib is approximately 3 hours and the mean half-life of ruxolitinib + metabolites is approximately 5.8 hours.
                        
                           Effects of Age, Gender, or Race 
                        
                        In healthy subjects, no significant differences in ruxolitinib pharmacokinetics were observed with regard to gender and race. In a population pharmacokinetic evaluation in MF patients, no relationship was apparent between oral clearance and patient age or race, and in women, clearance was 17.7 L/h and in men, 22.1 L/h with 39% inter-subject variability. Clearance was 12.7 L/h in PV patients, with a 42% inter-subject variability, and no relationship was apparent between oral clearance and gender, patient age or race in this patient population.

                           Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors
                           : In a trial of 16 healthy volunteers, a single dose of 10 mg of Jakafi was administered alone on Day 1 and a single dose of 10 mg of Jakafi was administered on Day 5 in combination with 200 mg of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, given twice daily on Days 2 to 5). Ketoconazole increased ruxolitinib Cmax and AUC by 33% and 91%, respectively. Ketoconazole also prolonged ruxolitinib half-life from 3.7 to 6.0 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].
                        
                           Fluconazole
                           : Simulations using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models suggested that fluconazole (a dual CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitor) increases steady state ruxolitinib AUC by approximately 100% to 300% following concomitant administration of 10 mg of Jakafi twice daily with 100 mg to 400 mg of fluconazole once daily, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].
                        
                           Mild or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors
                           : In a trial of 15 healthy volunteers, a single dose of 10 mg of Jakafi was administered alone on Day 1 and a single dose of 10 mg of Jakafi was administered on Day 5 in combination with 500 mg of erythromycin (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, given twice daily on Days 2 to 5). Erythromycin increased ruxolitinib Cmax and AUC by 8% and 27%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
                        
                           CYP3A4 inducers
                           : In a trial of 12 healthy volunteers, a single dose of 50 mg of Jakafi was administered alone on Day 1 and a single dose of 50 mg of Jakafi was administered on Day 13 in combination with 600 mg of rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer, given once daily on Days 3 to 13). Rifampin decreased ruxolitinib Cmax and AUC by 32% and 61%, respectively. In addition, the relative exposure to ruxolitinib’s active metabolites increased approximately 100% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

                           studies
                           : 
                           In vitro, ruxolitinib and its M18 metabolite do not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4. Ruxolitinib is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations.
                        
                           In vitro, ruxolitinib and its M18 metabolite do not inhibit the P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1 or OAT3 transport systems at clinically relevant concentrations. Ruxolitinib is not a substrate for the P-gp transporter.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.4 		Thorough QT Study
                     
                        The effect of single dose ruxolitinib 25 mg and 200 mg on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) four-period crossover thorough QT study in 47 healthy subjects. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on Fridericia correction method (QTcF) was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern. The dose of 200 mg is adequate to represent the high exposure clinical scenario.
