                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Fentanyl is a pure opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic 
action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include 
substances such as morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, codeine, and hydrocodone. 

                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, 
euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, 
cough suppression, and analgesia. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with 
increasing doses there is increasing analgesia, unlike with mixed 
agonist/antagonists or non-opioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the 
analgesic effect with increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, 
there is no defined maximum dose; the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is 
imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may include somnolence 
and respiratory depression.
                        
                        
                        AnalgesiaThe analgesic effects of fentanyl are related to the blood level 
of the drug, if proper allowance is made for the delay into and out of the CNS 
(a process with a 3- to 5-minute half-life).
                        In general, the effective concentration and the concentration at which 
toxicity occurs increase with increasing tolerance with any and all opioids. The 
rate of development of tolerance varies widely among individuals. As a result, 
the dose of OTFC should be individually titrated to achieve the desired effect 
[see Dosage And 
Administration (2.2)].
                        
                        
                        Central Nervous SystemThe precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown although 
fentanyl is known to be a mu-opioid receptor agonist. 
Specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity 
have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the 
analgesic effects of this drug.
                        Fentanyl produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem 
respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the 
responsiveness of the brain stem to increases in carbon dioxide and to 
electrical stimulation.
                        Fentanyl depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in 
the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually 
required for analgesia.
                        Fentanyl causes miosis even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of 
opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic 
or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). 
                        
                        
                        Gastrointestinal SystemFentanyl causes a reduction in motility associated with an 
increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and in the duodenum. 
Digestion of food is delayed in the small intestine and propulsive contractions 
are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while 
tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other 
opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and 
pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations 
in serum amylase. 
                        
                        
                        Cardiovascular SystemFentanyl may produce release of histamine with or without 
associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release and/or 
peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, 
and/or orthostatic hypotension.
                        
                        
                        Endocrine SystemOpioid agonists have been shown to have a variety of effects on 
the secretion of hormones. Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, and 
luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth 
hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon in 
humans and other species, rats and dogs. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) has 
been shown to be both inhibited and stimulated by opioids.
                        
                        
                        Respiratory SystemAll opioid mu-receptor agonists, 
including fentanyl, produce dose-dependent respiratory depression. The risk of 
respiratory depression is less in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy who 
develop tolerance to respiratory depression and other opioid effects. During the 
titration phase of the clinical trials, somnolence, which may be a precursor to 
respiratory depression, did increase in patients who were treated with higher 
doses of OTFC. Peak respiratory depressive effects may be seen as early as 15 to 
30 minutes from the start of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate product 
administration and may persist for several hours.
                        Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses. 
Fentanyl depresses the cough reflex as a result of its CNS activity. Although 
not observed with oral transmucosal fentanyl products in clinical trials, 
fentanyl given rapidly by intravenous injection in large doses may interfere 
with respiration by causing rigidity in the muscles of respiration. Therefore, 
physicians and other healthcare providers should be aware of this potential 
complication [see Boxed Warning - Warning: 
Importance Of Proper Patient Selection, Dosing, and Potential for Abuse, Contraindications (4), Warnings 
And Precautions (5.2), 
Adverse Reactions (6), and Overdosage (10)].
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        AbsorbtionThe absorption pharmacokinetics of fentanyl from the oral 
transmucosal dosage form is a combination of an initial rapid absorption from 
the buccal mucosa and a more prolonged absorption of swallowed fentanyl from the 
GI tract. Both the blood fentanyl profile and the bioavailability of fentanyl 
will vary depending on the fraction of the dose that is absorbed through the 
oral mucosa and the fraction swallowed.
                        Absolute bioavailability, as determined by area under the concentration-time 
curve, of 15 mcg/kg in 12 adult males was 50% compared to intravenous 
fentanyl.
                        Normally, approximately 25% of the total dose of OTFC is rapidly absorbed 
from the buccal mucosa and becomes systemically available. The remaining 75% of 
the total dose is swallowed with the saliva and then is slowly absorbed from the 
GI tract. About 1/3 of this amount (25% of the total dose) escapes hepatic and 
intestinal first-pass elimination and becomes systemically available. Thus, the 
generally observed 50% bioavailability of OTFC is divided equally between rapid 
transmucosal and slower GI absorption. Therefore, a unit dose of OTFC, if chewed 
and swallowed, might result in lower peak concentrations and lower 
bioavailability than when consumed as directed.
                        Dose proportionality among four of the available strengths of OTFC (200, 400, 
800, and 1600 mcg) has been demonstrated in a balanced crossover design in adult 
subjects (n=11). Mean serum fentanyl levels following these four doses of OTFC 
are shown in Figure 1. The curves for each dose level are similar in shape with 
increasing dose levels producing increasing serum fentanyl levels. Cmax and AUC0→∞ increased in a 
dose-dependent manner that is approximately proportional to the OTFC 
administered.

in Adult Subjects Comparing 4 Doses of OTFC
                        The pharmacokinetic parameters of the four strengths of OTFC tested in the 
dose-proportionality study are shown in Table 3. The mean Cmax ranged from 0.39 - 2.51 ng/mL. The median time of maximum 
plasma concentration (Tmax) across these four doses of 
OTFC varied from 20 - 40 minutes (range of 20 - 480 minutes) as measured after 
the start of administration.

DistributionFentanyl is highly lipophilic. Animal data showed that following 
absorption, fentanyl is rapidly distributed to the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys 
and spleen followed by a slower redistribution to muscles and fat. The plasma 
protein binding of fentanyl is 80-85%. The main binding protein is alpha-1-acid 
glycoprotein, but both albumin and lipoproteins contribute to some extent. The 
free fraction of fentanyl increases with acidosis. The mean volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vss) was 4 L/kg.
                        
                        
                        MetabolismFentanyl is metabolized in the liver and in the intestinal mucosa 
to norfentanyl by cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform. Norfentanyl was not found to be 
pharmacologically active in animal studies [see Drug Interactions (7)].
                        
                        
                        Elimination Fentanyl is primarily (more than 90%) eliminated by 
biotransformation to N-dealkylated and hydroxylated inactive metabolites. Less 
than 7% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, and only about 1% is 
excreted unchanged in the feces. The metabolites are mainly excreted in the 
urine, while fecal excretion is less important. The total plasma clearance of 
fentanyl was 0.5 L/hr/kg (range 0.3 - 0.7 L/hr/kg). The terminal elimination 
half-life after OTFC administration is about 7 hours.
