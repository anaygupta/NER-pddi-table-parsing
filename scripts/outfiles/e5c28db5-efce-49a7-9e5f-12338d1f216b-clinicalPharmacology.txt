                  Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are 
adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract. Glucocorticoids cause varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify 
the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli. Naturally occurring 
glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have sodium-retaining 
properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. 
Their synthetic analogs including dexamethasone are primarily used for their 
anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.
                  At equipotent anti-inflammatory doses, dexamethasone almost completely lacks 
the sodium-retaining property of hydrocortisone and closely related derivatives 
of hydrocortisone.
