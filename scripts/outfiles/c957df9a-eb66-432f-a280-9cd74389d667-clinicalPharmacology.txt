Mechanism of Action
Trepadone acts by restoring and maintaining the balance of the neurotransmitters; GABA, nitric oxide, serotonin, and acetylcholine that are associated with pain disorders and inflammatory conditions. Trepadone stimulates the production ACTH to reduce inflammation. Trepadone stimulates the production prostaglandins to reduce inflammation. Trepadone stimulates the production joint cartilage.

                     
Metabolism
The amino acids in Trepadone are primarily absorbed by the stomach and small intestines. All cells metabolize the amino acids in Trepadone. Circulating tryptophan, arginine and choline blood levels determine the production of serotonin, nitric oxide, and acetylcholine. The Omega-3 free fatty acids in Trepadone are primarily absorbed by the stomach and small intestines. Inflammatory cells metabolize the free fatty acids in Trepadone.
                  Excretion
Trepadone is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4. These isoenzymes are principally responsible for 95% of all detoxification of drugs, with CYP3A4 being responsible for detoxification of roughly 50% of drugs. Amino acids do not appear to have an effect on drug metabolizing enzymes. Free fatty acids, glucosamine, and chondroitin sulfate do not appear to have an effect on drug metabolizing enzymes
