                     7.1 The Effect of Other Drugs on Quetiapine 
                     
                        The risks of using quetiapine fumarate in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Given the primary CNS effects of quetiapine fumarate, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Quetiapine fumarate potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected psychotic disorders, and alcoholic beverages should be limited while taking quetiapine.
                        Quetiapine exposure is increased by the prototype CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.), and decreased by the prototype CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. John’s wort etc). Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.

                        Co-administration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4, resulted in significant increase in quetiapine exposure. The dose of quetiapine fumarate should be reduced to one sixth of the original dose if co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (
                              2.4
                           ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (
                              12.3
                           )].

                        Coadministration of quetiapine and phenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer increased the mean oral clearance of quetiapine by 5-fold. Increased doses of quetiapine fumarate up to 5 fold may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving quetiapine and phenytoin, or other known potent CYP3A4 inducers [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (
                              2.5
                           ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (
                              12.3
                           )]. When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine fumarate should be reduced to the original level within 7 to 14 days [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (
                              2.5
                           )].
                        The potential effects of several concomitant medications on quetiapine pharmacokinetics were studied [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (
                              12.3
                           )].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Effect of Quetiapine on Other Drugs
                     
                        Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, quetiapine fumarate may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.
                        Quetiapine fumarate may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.
                        There are no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions of quetiapine fumarate on other drugs based on the CYP pathway. Quetiapine fumarate and its metabolites are non-inhibitors of major metabolizing CYP’s (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4).
