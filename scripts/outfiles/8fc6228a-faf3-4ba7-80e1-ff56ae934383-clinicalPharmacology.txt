                  Iobenguane or meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a physiological analog of the guanidines, such as guanethidine and phenethylguanidine. In adrenergic nerves, guanidines are believed to share the same transport pathway as norepinephrine and to accumulate in, and displace norepinephrine from, intraneuronal storage granules. Similarly, I-123 MIBG is concentrated in, stored in, and released from chromaffin granules. The retention of I-123 MIBG in the adrenal medulla may be a result of their uptake in adrenergic neurons and subsequent sequestration into chromaffin storage granules. Due to their selective uptake mechanism, I-123 MIBG allows specific detection and localization of neuroendocrine tumors and adrenal medullary hyperplasia. The gamma emissions given off by I-123 MIBG allow detection of adrenergic tumors by scintigraphy. Medullary thyroid carcinoma: Although the mechanism of I-123 MIBG uptake by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is not completely understood, it has been found that MTC can produce catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). Therefore, I-123 MIBG could be taken up and stored in catecholamine vesicles of MTC.
