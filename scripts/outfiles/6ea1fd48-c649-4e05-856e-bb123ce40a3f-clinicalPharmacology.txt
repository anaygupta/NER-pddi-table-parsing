                     When Exametazime is reconstituted with Tc99m pertechnetate, a lipophilic complex of Tc99m Exametazime is formed and is the active ingredient of the reconstituted product. The lipophilic complex crosses the blood-brain barrier. It converts to the less lipophilic complex 12% per hour. The preparation is good for 30 minutes without the use of a stabilizer. The in vitro addition of cobalt chloride helps to stabilize the complex for 6 hours.

                     The lipophilic complex of Tc99m Exametazime is taken up by leukocytes and selectively     retained by neutrophils. Cobalt chloride, as a stabilizer, may be used with this procedure as well
