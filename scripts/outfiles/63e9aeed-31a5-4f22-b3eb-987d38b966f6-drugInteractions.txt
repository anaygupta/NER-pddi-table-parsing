                     7.1 Drugs That May Increase Risks of Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities
                     
                        Use caution when prescribing Prepopik® for patients with conditions or who are using medications that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. This includes patients receiving drugs which may be associated with hypokalemia (such as diuretics or corticosteroids, or drugs where hypokalemia is a particular risk, such as cardiac glycosides) or hyponatremia. Use caution when Prepopik® is used in patients on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) or drugs known to induce Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, antipsychotic drugs and carbamazepine, as these drugs may increase the risk of water retention and/or electrolyte imbalance. Consider additional patient evaluations as appropriate.

                     7.2	Potential for Altered Drug Absorption
                     
                        Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of administration of Prepopik® solution may be flushed from the GI tract and the medication may not be absorbed.
                        Tetracycline and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, iron, digoxin, chlorpromazine and penicillamine, should be taken at least 2 hours before and not less than 6 hours after administration of Prepopik® to avoid chelation with magnesium.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	Antibiotics
                     
                        Prior or concomitant use of antibiotics with Prepopik® may reduce efficacy of Prepopik® as conversion of sodium picosulfate to its active metabolite BHPM is mediated by colonic bacteria.
