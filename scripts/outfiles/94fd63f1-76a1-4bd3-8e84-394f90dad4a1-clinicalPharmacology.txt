                     It
is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm
fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant
decrease in the incidence of dental caries.
                  
                  
                     Multivitamin
with 0.5 mg Fluoride Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride and ten
essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are
chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride.
                  Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body.
The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is
formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite. The
reaction may be expressed by the equation:

                  
Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F-  ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH-
     (Hydroxyapatite)                       (Fluorapatite)

                  
Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished:

                  
    1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed.
    2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted.
    3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva.
