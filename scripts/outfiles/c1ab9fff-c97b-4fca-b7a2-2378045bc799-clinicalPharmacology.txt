                  Sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of metabolic acidosis. It is also useful in patients who require alkalinization of body fluids for other reasons.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HC03-) ions. Sodium is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid. Bicarbonate is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/L. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney. Bicarbonate anion, at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion (H+), may be converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3), then to its volatile form, carbon dioxide (CO2) excreted by the lung. Normally, a ratio of 1:20 (carbonic acid:bicarbonate) is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.
