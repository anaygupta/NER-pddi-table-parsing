                     7.1 Strong Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4
                     
                        Atorvastatin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4.

                              Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of atorvastatin alone [see 
                                    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                                 ]. Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the atorvastatin dose exceeds 20 mg [see 
                                    Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)

                                 Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of atorvastatin alone [see 
                                 
                                    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                                 
                                 ]. Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of atorvastatin should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing atorvastatin and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of atorvastatin should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution [see

                           Atorvastatin and atorvastatin-metabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mg/kg/day compared to that of atorvastatin alone [see 
                           
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           
                           ]. The coadministration of atorvastatin with cyclosporine should be avoided [see

                           Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of atorvastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided [see

                           Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, atorvastatin should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates [see

                           The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when atorvastatin is used in combination with niacin; a reduction in atorvastatin dosage should be considered in this setting [see

                        Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of atorvastatin with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of atorvastatin after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations.

                        When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.

                        Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           ]. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.
