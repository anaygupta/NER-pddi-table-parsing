                  No drug-drug interaction studies in human subjects have been conducted.  Toxicologic and toxicokinetic studies in rats did not demonstrate any alterations in the clearance or toxicologic profile of either methotrexate or Kineret when the two agents were administered together.

               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           A higher rate of serious infections has been observed in RA patients treated with concurrent Kineret and etanercept therapy than in patients treated with etanercept alone. Use of Kineret in combination with TNF blocking agents is not recommended (7)

                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 TNF Blocking Agents

                     
                        A higher rate of serious infections has been observed in patients treated with concurrent Kineret and etanercept therapy than in patients treated with etanercept alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].  Two percent of patients treated concurrently with Kineret and etanercept developed neutropenia (ANC < 1 x 109/L).  Use of Kineret in combination with TNF blocking agents is not recommended.
