                           GATTEX has the potential to increase absorption of concomitant oral medications.  Careful monitoring and possible dose adjustment of oral medications that require titration or have a narrow therapeutic index is recommended.

                     7.1	Potential for Increased Absorption of Oral Medications
                     
                        Based upon the pharmacodynamic effect of GATTEX, there is a potential for increased absorption of concomitant oral medications, which should be considered if these drugs require titration or have a narrow therapeutic index.  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]

                        Clinical interaction studies were not performed. No inhibition or induction of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system has been observed based on in vitro studies although the relevance of in vitro studies to an in vivo setting is unknown.
