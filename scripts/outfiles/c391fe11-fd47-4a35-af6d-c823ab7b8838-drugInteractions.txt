                        Tamoxifen
                     
                     
                  
                  Coadministration of letrozole and tamoxifen 20 mg daily resulted in a reduction of letrozole plasma levels of 38% on average. Clinical experience in the second-line breast cancer trials indicates that the therapeutic effect of letrozole therapy is not impaired if letrozole is administered immediately after tamoxifen. 
                  
                     
                        Cimetidine
                     
                     
                  
                  A pharmacokinetic interaction study with cimetidine showed no clinically significant effect on letrozole pharmacokinetics. 
                  
                     
                        Warfarin
                     
                     
                  
                  An interaction study with warfarin showed no clinically significant effect of letrozole on warfarin pharmacokinetics.

                  There is no clinical experience to date on the use of letrozole in combination with other anticancer agents.
