                        Do not use in patients receiving prescription monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (certain drugs for depression, psychiatric, or emotional conditions, or Parkinson's disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping the MAOI drug. If you do not know if your prescription drug contains an MAOI, ask a doctor or pharmacist before taking this product. The use of dextromethorphan may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with alcohol, antihistamines, psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression. Patients may develop hypotension, hyperpyrexia, nausea, myoclonic leg jerks and coma following coadministration of MAO inhibitors and dextromethorphan. MAO inhibitors also prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines. Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effect of methyldopa, reserpine, veratrum, alkaloids and mecamylamine. Alcohol and other sedative drugs will potentiate the sedative effects of Chlorpheniramine. Care should be taken in administering this product concomitantly with other sympathomimetic amines since their combined effect on the cardiovascular system may be harmful to the patient.
