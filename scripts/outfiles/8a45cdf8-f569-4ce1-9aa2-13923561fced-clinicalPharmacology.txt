                  Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative which differs structurally from the antipsychotic phenothlazines by the presence of abranched side chain and no ring substitution. It is thought that this configuration is responsible for its relative lack (1/10 that of chlorpromazine) of dopamine antagonist properties.
                  Promethazine is an H₁  receptor blocking agent. In addition to its antlhlstamlnlc action, it provides clinically useful sedabve and anllemetic effects. 
                  Promethazine is well absorbed from the gastrointeslinal tract. ClinIcal effects are apparent within 20 minutes after oral administration and generally last four to six hours, although they may persist as long as 12 hours. Promethazine is metabolized by the liver to a variety of compounds; the sulfoxides of promethazine and N-demethylpromethazlne are the predominant metabolites appearing in the urine.
