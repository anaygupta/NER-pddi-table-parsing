                        Phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride may interact with compounds that stimulate both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors (i.e., epinephrine) to produce an exaggerated hypotensive response and tachycardia. (See WARNING.)
                        PhenoxybenzamineÂ blocks hyperthermia production by levarterenol, and blocks hypothermia production by reserpine.
