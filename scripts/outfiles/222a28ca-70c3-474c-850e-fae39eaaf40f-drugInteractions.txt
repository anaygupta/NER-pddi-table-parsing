                              Insulin and/or Oral hypoglycemic Agents: Patients with acromegaly and with diabetes mellitus may require careful monitoring and dose reductions of insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents. (5.2, 7.1)
                           
                              Opioids: Patients on opioids may need higher SOMAVERT doses to achieve appropriate IGF-I suppression. (7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Insulin and/or Oral hypoglycemic Agents
                     
                        After initiation of SOMAVERT, patients with acromegaly and diabetes mellitus treated with insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents may require dose reductions of insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Opioids
                     
                        In clinical studies, patients taking opioids often needed higher SOMAVERT doses to normalize IGF-I concentrations compared with patients not receiving opioids. The mechanism of this interaction is not known.
