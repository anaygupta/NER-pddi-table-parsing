                  Carisoprodol is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that does not directly relax skeletal muscles in man. The mode of action of carisprodol in relieving acute muscle spasm of local origin has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. In animals, carisoprodol has been shown to produce muscle relaxation by blocking interneuronal activity and depressing transmission of polysynaptic neurons in the spinal cord and in the descending reticular formation of the brain. The onset of action is rapid and lasts four to six hours.
                  Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver and is excreted by the kidneys. One of the products of metabolism, is active as an anxiolytic. The degree to which it contributes to the efficacy of carisoprodol is unknown. Carisoprodol is dialyzable by peritoneal and hemodialysis.
                  Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion
                  Following a single oral dose of carisoprodol, the time to maximum concentratin (Tmax) was 1.98 + 1.16 hours and the terminal elimination half-life was 2.44 + 0.93 hours. By normalizing to a single 350 mg Carisoprodol tablet, the mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 2.29 + 0.68 mcg/mL, the area under the plasma level time curve (AUC0-0) was 10.33 + 3.87 mcg/mL* hour, and the oral clearance (Cl/F) was 39.52 + 16.83 L/hour. The mean Cmax of metabolite, meprobamate, was 2.08 + 0.48 mcg/mL, a subtherapeutic concentration when compared to a plasma concentration of a single oral meprobamate 400 mg tablet which would yield a meprobamate concentration of approximately 8.0 mcg/mL.
