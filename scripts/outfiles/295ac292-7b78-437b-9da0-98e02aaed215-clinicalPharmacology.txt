The mechanism of action of mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets, as with 
other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, is 
unknown.
 
Evidence gathered in preclinical studies suggests that 
mirtazapine enhances central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. These 
studies have shown that mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic 
α2 adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and 
heteroreceptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in 
central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity.
 
Mirtazapine is a potent 
antagonist of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 
receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B 
receptors.
 
Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of histamine (H1) receptors, a property that may explain its prominent 
sedative effects.
 
Mirtazapine is a moderate peripheral α1 adrenergic antagonist, a property that may explain the 
occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its 
use.
 
Mirtazapine is a moderate antagonist at muscarinic receptors, a 
property that may explain the relatively low incidence of anticholinergic side 
effects associated with its use.

                  

                  
Pharmacokinetics
Mirtazapine 
Orally Disintegrating Tablets are rapidly and completely absorbed following oral 
administration and have a half-life of about 20 to 40 hours. Peak plasma 
concentrations are reached within about 2 hours following an oral dose. The 
presence of food in the stomach has a minimal effect on both the rate and extent 
of absorption and does not require a dosage adjustment. Mirtazapine Orally 
Disintegrating Tablets are bioequivalent to mirtazapine 
tablets.
 
Mirtazapine is extensively metabolized after oral 
administration. Major pathways of biotransformation are demethylation and 
hydroxylation followed by glucuronide conjugation. In vitro 
data from human liver microsomes indicate that cytochrome 2D6 and 1A2 are 
involved in the formation of the 8-hydroxy metabolite of mirtazapine, whereas 
cytochrome 3A is considered to be responsible for the formation of the 
N-desmethyl and N-oxide metabolite. Mirtazapine has an absolute bioavailability 
of about 50 percent. It is eliminated predominantly via urine (75 percent) with 
15 percent in feces. Several unconjugated metabolites possess pharmacological 
activity but are present in the plasma at very low levels. The (-) enantiomer 
has an elimination half-life that is approximately twice as long as the (+) 
enantiomer and therefore achieves plasma levels that are about three times as 
high as that of the (+) enantiomer.
 
Plasma levels are linearly related 
to dose over a dose range of 15 to 80 mg. The mean elimination half-life of 
mirtazapine after oral administration ranges from approximately 20 to 40 hours 
across age and gender subgroups, with females of all ages exhibiting 
significantly longer elimination half-lives than males (mean half-life of 37 
hours for females vs. 26 hours for males). Steady state plasma levels of 
mirtazapine are attained within 5 days, with about 50 percent accumulation 
(accumulation ratio = 1.5). 
 
Mirtazapine is approximately 85% bound to 
plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.01 to 10 mcg/mL.
