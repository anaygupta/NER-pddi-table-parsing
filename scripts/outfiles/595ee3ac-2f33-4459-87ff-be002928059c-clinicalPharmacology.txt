                  Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they may delay healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant in a particular case.
                  The anti-infective components in the combination are included to provide action against specific organisms susceptible to them. Neomycin sulfate and polymyxin B sulfate together are considered active against the following microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella-Enterobacter species, Neisseria species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This product does not provide adequate coverage against Serratia marcescens and streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae.
                  The relative potency of corticosteroids depends on the molecular structure, concentration, and release from the vehicle.
