                  Xenon Xe 133 is a readily diffusible gas which is neither utilized nor produced by the body. It passes through cell membranes, freely exchanges between blood and tissue, and tends to concentrate more in body fat than in blood, plasma, water or protein solutions. In the concentrations recommended for diagnostic studies, it is physiologically inactive. Inhaled Xenon Xe 133 Gas will enter the alveolar wall and the pulmonary venous circulation via capillaries. Most of the Xenon Xe 133 Gas that enters the circulation from a single breath is returned to the lungs and exhaled after a single pass through the peripheral circulation.
