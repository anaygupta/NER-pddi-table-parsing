CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
After intravenous administration, technetium Tc99m succimer injection is distributed in the plasma, apparently bound to plasma proteins. There is negligible activity in the red blood cells. The activity is cleared from the plasma with a half-time of about 60 minutes and concentrates in the renal cortex. Approximately 16% of the activity is excreted in the urine within two hours. At six hours about 20% of the dose is concentrated in each kidney.
