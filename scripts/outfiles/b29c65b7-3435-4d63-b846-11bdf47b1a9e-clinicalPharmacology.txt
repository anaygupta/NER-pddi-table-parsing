                  When injected intravenously, Technetium Tc 99m Pyrophosphate has a specific affinity for areas of altered osteogenesis. It is also concentrated in the injured myocardium, primarily in areas of irreversibly damaged myocardial cells. 
                  One to two hours after intravenous injection of Technetium Tc 99m Pyrophosphate, an estimated 40 to 50 percent of the injected dose had been taken up by the skeleton, and approximately 0.01 to 0.02 percent per gram of acutely infarcted myocardium. Within a period of one hour, 10 to 11 percent remains in the vascular system, declining to approximately 2 to 3 percent twenty-four hours post injection. The average urinary excretion was observed to be about 40 percent of the administered dose after 24 hours. 
                  TechneScan PYP also has an affinity for red blood cells. When administered 15 to 30 minutes prior to the intravenous administration of sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m (in vivo red blood cell labeling), approximately 75 percent of the injected radioactivity remains in the blood pool providing excellent images of the cardiac chambers. When the modified in vivo/in vitro red blood cell labeling method is used, comparable percentages of the injected radioactivity are obtained.
