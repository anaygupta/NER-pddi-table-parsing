                  The exact mechanism by which erythromycin reduces lesions of acne 
vulgaris is not fully known: however, the effect appears to be due in part to 
the antibacterial activity of the drug.
                  
                  
                     Microbiology: Erythromycin acts by 
inhibition of protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by reversibly binding 
to 50 S ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting 
translocation of aminoacyl transfer-RNA and inhibiting polypeptide synthesis. 
Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between 
erythromycin, lincomycin, chloramphenicol, and clindamycin.
