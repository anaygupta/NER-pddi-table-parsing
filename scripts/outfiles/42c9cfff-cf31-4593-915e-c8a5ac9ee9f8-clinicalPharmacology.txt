                     Mechanism of Action:
                     
                        Lidocaine HCI stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Hemodynamics:
                     
                        Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism:
                     
                        Lidocaine HCI may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate of absorption and percent of dose absorbed depending upon concentration and total dose administered, the specific site of application and duration of exposure. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine HCI is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver.
                        Lidocaine HCI is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidney. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine HCI. Approximately 90% of lidocaine HCI administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline.
                        The plasma binding of lidocaine HCI is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine HCI is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.
                        Lidocaine HCI crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion.
                        Studies of lidocaine HCI metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine HCI is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine HCI kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged twofold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine HCI kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites.
                        Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine HCI required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.
