                           Drugs that Prolong QT
                        
                        Co-administration of drugs that prolong the QT interval with SIGNIFOR may have additive effects on the prolongation of the QT interval. Caution is required when co-administering SIGNIFOR with drugs that may prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

                           Cyclosporine
                        
                        Concomitant administration of cyclosporine with pasireotide may decrease the relative bioavailability of cyclosporine and, therefore, dose adjustment of cyclosporine to maintain therapeutic levels may be necessary.
                        
                           Bromocriptine
                        
                        Co-administration of somatostatin analogues with bromocriptine may increase the blood levels of bromocriptine. Dose reduction of bromocriptine may be necessary.
