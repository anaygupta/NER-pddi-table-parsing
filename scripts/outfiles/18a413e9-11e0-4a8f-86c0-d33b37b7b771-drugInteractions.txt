                  Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when SUBSYS is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. 
                  The concomitant use of SUBSYS with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving SUBSYS concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively.
                  The concomitant use of SUBSYS with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of SUBSYS. Patients receiving SUBSYS who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers should be monitored for signs of increased SUBSYS activity and the dose of SUBSYS should be adjusted accordingly.
                  Concomitant use of SUBSYS with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
