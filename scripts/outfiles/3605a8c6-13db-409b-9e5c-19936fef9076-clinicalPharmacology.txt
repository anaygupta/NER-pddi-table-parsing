                  12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of olanzapine, as with other drugs having 
efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this 
drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine 
and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. The mechanism of action of olanzapine in 
the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I 
disorder is unknown
