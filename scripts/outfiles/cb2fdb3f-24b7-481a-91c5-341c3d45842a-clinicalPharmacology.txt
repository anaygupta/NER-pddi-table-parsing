                   The mechanism of action of Benzoyl Peroxide is not totally understood but its antibacterial activity against Propionibacterium acnes is thought to be a major mode of action. In addition, patients treated with Benzoyl Peroxide show a reduction in lipids and free fatty acids, and mild desquamation (drying and peeling activity) with simultaneous reduction in comedones and acne lesions. Little is known about the percutaneous penetration, metabolism, and excretion of Benzoyl Peroxide, although it has been shown that Benzoyl Peroxide absorbed by the skin is metabolized to benzoic acid and then excreted as benzoate in the urine. There is no evidence of systemic toxicity caused by Benzoyl Peroxide in humans.
