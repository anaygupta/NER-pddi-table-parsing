                  Olopatadine is an inhibitor of the release of histamine from the 
mast cell and a relatively selective histamine H1-antagonist that inhibits the in vivo 
and in vitro type 1 immediate hypersensitivity 
reaction including inhibition of histamine induced effects on human conjunctival 
epithelial cells. Olopatadine is devoid of effects on alpha-adrenergic, 
dopamine, and muscarinic type 1 and 2 receptors. Following topical ocular 
administration in man, olopatadine was shown to have low systemic exposure. Two 
studies in normal volunteers (totaling 24 subjects) dosed bilaterally with 
olopatadine 0.15% ophthalmic solution once every 12 hours for 2 weeks 
demonstrated plasma concentrations to be generally below the quantitation limit 
of the assay (<0.5 ng/mL). Samples in which olopatadine was quantifiable were 
typically found within 2 hours of dosing and ranged from 0.5 to 1.3 ng/mL. The 
half-life in plasma was approximately 3 hours, and elimination was predominantly 
through renal excretion. Approximately 60-70% of the dose was recovered in the 
urine as parent drug. Two metabolites, the mono-desmethyl and the N-oxide, were 
detected at low concentrations in the urine.
                  Results from an environmental study demonstrated that PATANOL was effective 
in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis when dosed 
twice daily for up to 6 weeks. Results from conjunctival antigen challenge 
studies demonstrated that PATANOL, when subjects were challenged with antigen 
both initially and up to 8 hours after dosing, was significantly more effective 
than its vehicle in preventing ocular itching associated with allergic 
conjunctivitis.
