                     12.1 Mechanism of Action 
                     
                        Hemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation caused by a deficiency in factor IX and results in bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. Treatment with IXINITY replaces factor IX, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics 
                     
                        The administration of IXINITY increases plasma levels of factor IX and can temporarily correct the coagulation defect in these patients, as reflected by decrease in the aPTT.

                               Pharmacokinetic studies with IXINITY were conducted in 32 previously treated patients (PTPs) ≥ 12 years of age with severe to moderately severe hemophilia B (factor IX ≤ 2 IU/dL). Intravenous administration of 75 ± 5 IU/kg of IXINITY to 32 PTPs showed an initial recovery ranging from 51 to 113% (median 70%). The results of pharmacokinetic studies are summarized below in Table 6Pharmacokinetic Parameters for IXINITY (n = 32).

Pharmacokinetic parameters were re-assessed in a subset of 14 subjects after routine treatment with IXINITY for a median of 5.8 months (range 3.1 to 18.6 months) as summarized in Table 5 below.

Repeat dosing did not impact the pharmacokinetics of IXINITY.
                        The PK data were divided into two subgroups of subjects with a BMI ≤ 30 (n = 26) or BMI > 30 (n = 6). The AUC(0-∞) and Cmax values of IXINITY were 40% and 34% higher, respectively, in subjects with BMI > 30.
