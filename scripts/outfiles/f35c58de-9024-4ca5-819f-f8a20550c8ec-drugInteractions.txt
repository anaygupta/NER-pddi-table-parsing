                        Additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist,                                     if available. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique,                                     mix thoroughly and do not store.
                          The presence of calcium                                     limits their compatibility with certain drugs that form                                     precipitates of calcium salts, and also prohibits their                                     simultaneous infusion through the same administration set as                                     blood because of the likelihood of coagulation.
