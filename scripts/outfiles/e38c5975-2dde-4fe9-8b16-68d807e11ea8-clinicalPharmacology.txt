sulfacetamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact
the sulfacetamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic
acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While
absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium
sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when
taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely uncharged. The
biologial half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The
exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but
it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium
acnes and the formation of free fatty acids.
