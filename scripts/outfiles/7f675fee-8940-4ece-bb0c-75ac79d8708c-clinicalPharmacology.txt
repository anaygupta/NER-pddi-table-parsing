                     12.1	 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        PrismaSol solution is a pharmacologically inactive solution. The electrolyte concentrations in the PrismaSol solutions are chosen to restore plasma levels to clinically desired concentrations or maintain plasma levels at the desired concentrations.
                        PrismaSol solution is used as replacement solution to replace water and electrolytes removed during hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration. Bicarbonate in the solution is used as an alkalinizing buffer to normalize acid-base balance.
                        Lactate is used for the adjustment of the solution pH and is metabolized to bicarbonate.
                        When dextrose is present, it is intended to help normalize glucose balance.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2	 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The distribution of electrolytes, bicarbonate and dextrose is determined by the patient's clinical condition, metabolic status, and residual renal function.
                        The elimination and replacement of water, electrolytes and buffer depend on the patient's electrolyte and acid-base balance, metabolic status, residual renal function and ongoing physiologic losses through intestinal, respiratory and cutaneous routes.
