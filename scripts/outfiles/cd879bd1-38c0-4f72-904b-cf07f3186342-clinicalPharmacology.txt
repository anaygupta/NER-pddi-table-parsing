                  Mechanism of Action
                  
                  Olmesartan medoxomil
                  Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction 
catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is 
the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that 
include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, 
cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the 
vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of 
angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in vascular smooth 
muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II 
synthesis.
                  An AT2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but 
this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. 
Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 
receptor.
                  Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit 
the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is a mechanism of many 
drugs used to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of 
bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because olmesartan medoxomil does 
not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. 
Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known.
                  Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory 
feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased 
plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the 
effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.
                  
                  
                  Hydrochlorothiazide
                  Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the 
renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing 
excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. 
Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, 
with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone 
secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum 
potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so 
co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the 
potassium loss associated with these diuretics.
                  The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully 
understood.
                  
                  Pharmacokinetics
                  
                  General
                  
                  
                  Olmesartan medoxomil
                  Olmesartan medoxomil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by 
ester hydrolysis to olmesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal 
tract. Olmesartan appears to be eliminated in a biphasic manner with a terminal 
elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Olmesartan shows linear 
pharmacokinetics following single oral doses of up to 320 mg and multiple oral 
doses of up to 80 mg. Steady-state levels of olmesartan are achieved within 3 to 
5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with once-daily dosing.
                  The absolute bioavailability of olmesartan is approximately 26%. After oral 
administration, the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 
olmesartan is reached after 1 to 2 hours. Food does not affect the 
bioavailability of olmesartan.
                  
                  
                  Hydrochlorothiazide
                  When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the 
plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours.
                  
                  
                  Metabolism and Excretion
                  
                  
                  Olmesartan medoxomil
                  Following the rapid and complete conversion of olmesartan 
medoxomil to olmesartan during absorption, there is virtually no further 
metabolism of olmesartan. Total plasma clearance of olmesartan is 1.3 L/h, with 
a renal clearance of 0.6 L/h. Approximately 35% to 50% of the absorbed dose is 
recovered in urine while the remainder is eliminated in feces via the 
bile.
                  
                  
                  Hydrochlorothiazide
                  Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly 
by the kidney. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 
hours.
                  
                  
                  Distribution
                  
                  
                  Olmesartan
                  The volume of distribution of olmesartan is approximately 17 L. 
Olmesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%) and does not penetrate red 
blood cells. The protein binding is constant at plasma olmesartan concentrations 
well above the range achieved with recommended doses.
                  In rats, olmesartan crossed the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. 
Olmesartan passed across the placental barrier in rats and was distributed to 
the fetus. Olmesartan was distributed to milk at low levels in rats.
                  
                  
                  Hydrochlorothiazide
                  Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain 
barrier and is excreted in breast milk.
                  
                  Special Populations
                     Pediatric:The pharmacokinetics of 
olmesartan have not been investigated in patients <18 years of age.
                  
                     Geriatric:The pharmacokinetics of olmesartan were 
studied in the elderly (>65 years). Overall, maximum plasma concentrations of 
olmesartan were similar in young adults and the elderly. Modest accumulation of 
olmesartan was observed in the elderly with repeated dosing; AUCss,
                     τ was 33% higher in elderly patients, 
corresponding to an approximate 30% reduction in CLR.
                  
                     Gender:Minor differences were observed in the 
pharmacokinetics of olmesartan in women compared to men. AUC and Cmax were 10-15% higher in women than in men.
                  
                     Renal Insufficiency:In patients with renal 
insufficiency, serum concentrations of olmesartan were elevated compared to 
subjects with normal renal function. After repeated dosing, the AUC was 
approximately tripled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance <20 mL/min). The pharmacokinetics of olmesartan in patients 
undergoing hemodialysis has not been studied.
                  
                     Hepatic Insufficiency:Increases in AUC0-∞ and Cmax for olmesartan were 
observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to those in 
matched controls, with an increase in AUC of about 60%.

                  Pharmacodynamics
                  
                  Olmesartan medoxomil
                  Olmesartan medoxomil doses of 2.5 to 40 mg inhibit the pressor 
effects of angiotensin I infusion. The duration of the inhibitory effect was 
related to dose, with doses of olmesartan medoxomil >40 mg giving >90% 
inhibition at 24 hours.
                  Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin 
activity (PRA) increase after single and repeated administration of olmesartan 
medoxomil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Repeated administration 
of up to 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil had minimal influence on aldosterone levels 
and no effect on serum potassium.
                  
                  
                  Hydrochlorothiazide
                  After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins 
within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.
                  
                  Clinical Trials
                  
                  Olmesartan medoxomil
                  The antihypertensive effects of olmesartan medoxomil have been 
demonstrated in seven placebo-controlled studies at doses ranging from 2.5 to 80 
mg for 6 to 12 weeks, each showing statistically significant reductions in peak 
and trough blood pressure. A total of 2693 patients (2145 olmesartan medoxomil; 
548 placebo) with essential hypertension were studied. Olmesartan medoxomil once 
daily (QD) lowered diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The response was 
dose-related. An olmesartan medoxomil dose of 20 mg daily produces a trough 
sitting BP reduction over placebo of about 10/6 mm Hg and a dose of 40 mg daily 
produces a trough sitting BP reduction over placebo of about 12/7 mm Hg. 
Olmesartan medoxomil doses greater than 40 mg had little additional effect. The 
onset of the antihypertensive effect occurred within 1 week and was largely 
manifest after 2 weeks.
                  The blood pressure lowering effect was maintained throughout the 24-hour 
period with olmesartan medoxomil once daily, with trough-to-peak ratios for 
systolic and diastolic response between 60 and 80%.
                  The blood pressure lowering effect of olmesartan medoxomil, with and without 
hydrochlorothiazide, was maintained in patients treated for up to 1 year. There 
was no evidence of tachyphylaxis during long-term treatment with olmesartan 
medoxomil or rebound effect following abrupt withdrawal of olmesartan medoxomil 
after 1 year of treatment.
                  The antihypertensive effect of olmesartan medoxomil was similar in men and 
women and in patients older and younger than 65 years. The effect was smaller in 
black patients (usually a low-renin population), as has been seen with other ACE 
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers. Olmesartan 
medoxomil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to 
hydrochlorothiazide.
                  
                  
                  Olmesartan 
medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide
                  In clinical trials 1230 patients were exposed to the combination 
of olmesartan medoxomil (2.5 mg to 40 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg to 25 
mg). These trials included one placebo-controlled factorial trial (n=502) in 
mild-moderate hypertensives with combinations of olmesartan medoxomil (10 mg, 20 
mg, 40 mg or placebo) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg, 25 mg or placebo). The 
antihypertensive effect of the combination on trough blood pressure was related 
to the dose of each component (see table below).
                  
                  


                  


Once-daily dosing with 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 12.5 mg 
hydrochlorothiazide, 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide 
or 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide produced mean 
placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) 
ranging from 17/8 to 24/14 mm Hg.
                  The onset of the antihypertensive effect occurred within 1 week and was near 
maximal at 4 weeks. The antihypertensive effect was independent of gender, but 
there were too few subjects to identify response differences based on race or 
age greater than or less than 65 years. No appreciable changes in trough heart 
rate were observed with combination therapy in the placebo-controlled trial.
