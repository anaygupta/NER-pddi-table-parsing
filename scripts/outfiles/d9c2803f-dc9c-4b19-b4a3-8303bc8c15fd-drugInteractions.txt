                     7.1 Probenecid

                     
                        
                           In vitro, avibactam is a substrate of OAT1 and OAT3 transporters which might contribute to the active uptake from the blood compartment, and thereby its excretion. As a potent OAT inhibitor, probenecid inhibits OAT uptake of avibactam by 56% to 70% in vitro and, therefore, has the potential to decrease the elimination of avibactam when co-administered. Because a clinical interaction study of AVYCAZ or avibactam alone with probenecid has not been conducted, co-administration of AVYCAZ with probenecid is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

                     
                        The administration of ceftazidime may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine with certain methods. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be used.
