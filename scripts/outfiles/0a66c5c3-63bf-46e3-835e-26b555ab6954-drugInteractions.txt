                        When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with ampicillin.
                        ALLOPURINOL: Increased possibility of skin rash, particularly in hyperuricemic patients may occur.
                        BACTERIOSTATIC ANTIBIOTICS: Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of penicillins. This has been demonstrated in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well-documented.
                        ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES: May be less effective and increased breakthrough bleeding may occur.
                        PROBENECID: May decrease renal tubular secretion of ampicillin resulting in increased blood levels and/or ampicillin toxicity.
