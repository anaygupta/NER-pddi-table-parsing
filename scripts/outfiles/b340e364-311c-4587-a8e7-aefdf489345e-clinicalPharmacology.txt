                  The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive
antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin in humans has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours.
