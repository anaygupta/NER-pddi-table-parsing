It is believed to block bacterial growth by acting as a competitive antagonist of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). While absorption through intact skin has not been determined for sodium sulfacetamide, it is estimated that 1% of topically applied sulfur is absorbed. Although the exact mode of the keralytic activity of sulfur is unknown, it is reported to result from the interaction of sulfur with the cysteine content of keratinocytes. In combination with sulfacetamide, sulfur has been reported to inhibit P. acnes, thereby reducing the associated inflammation.
