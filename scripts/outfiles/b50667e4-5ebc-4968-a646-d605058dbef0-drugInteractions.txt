                     7.1 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Sorafenib 
                     
                        Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, administered at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 5 days with a single oral dose of NEXAVAR 400 mg in healthy volunteers resulted in a 37% decrease in the mean AUC of sorafenib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, rifabutin, St. John’s wort), when possible, because these drugs can decrease the systemic exposure to sorafenib.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Sorafenib
                     
                        Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, administered at a dose of 400 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the mean AUC of a single oral dose of NEXAVAR 50 mg in healthy volunteers.  
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Effect of Sorafenib on Other Drugs
                     
                        NEXAVAR 400 mg twice daily for 28 days did not increase the systemic exposure of concomitantly administered midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), and omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Neomycin
                     
                        Neomycin administered as an oral dose of 1 g three times daily for 5 days decreased the mean AUC of sorafenib by 54% in healthy volunteers administered a single oral dose of NEXAVAR 400 mg. The effects of other antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib have not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Drugs that Increase Gastric pH
                     
                        The aqueous solubility of sorafenib is pH dependent, with higher pH resulting in lower solubility. However, omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, administered at a dose of 40 mg once daily for 5 days, did not result in a clinically meaningful change in sorafenib single dose exposure. No dose adjustment for NEXAVAR is necessary.
