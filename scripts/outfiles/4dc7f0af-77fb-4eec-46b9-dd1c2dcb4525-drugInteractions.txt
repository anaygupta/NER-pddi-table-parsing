                     7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inducers on CAPRELSA
                     
                        Rifampicin, a strong  CYP3A4 inducer, decreased vandetanib plasma concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of known strong CYP3A4 inducers during CAPRELSA therapy. Avoid concomitant use of St. John’s Wort because it can decrease vandetanib exposure unpredictably [see

                     7.2 Effect of CAPRELSA on OCT2 Transporter
                     
                        CAPRELSA increased plasma concentrations of metformin that is transported by the organic cation transporter type 2 (OCT2).  Use caution and closely monitor for toxicities when administering CAPRELSA with drugs that are transported by OCT2 [see

                        CAPRELSA increased plasma concentrations of digoxin.  Use caution and closely monitor for toxicities when administering CAPRELSA with digoxin [see

                        Avoid concomitant use of CAPRELSA with agents that may prolong the QT interval [see
