                        Concomitant administration of vancomycin and anesthetic agents has been associated with erythema and histamine-like flushing (see 
                              Pediatric Use under PRECAUTIONS
                           
                           ) and anaphylactoid reactions (see

                           ).
                        
                        Concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially, neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs, such as amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, bacitracin, polymyxin B, colistin, viomycin, or cisplatin, when indicated requires careful monitoring.Â  
                        
                           Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
                        
                        Although no long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, no mutagenic potential of vancomycin was found in standard laboratory tests. No definitive fertility studies have been performed.
