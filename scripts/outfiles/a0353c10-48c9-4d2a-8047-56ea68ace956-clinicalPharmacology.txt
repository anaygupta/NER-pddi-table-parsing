                           Microbiology: Erythromycin inhibits protein synthesis without affecting nucleic acid synthesis. Erythromycin is usually active against the following organisms in vitro and in clinical infections:

                        
                           Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Î²-hemolytic)

                        Alpha-hemolytic streptococci (viridans group)

                        
                           Staphylococcus aureus, including penicillinase-producing strains (methicillin-resistant staphylococci are uniformly resistant to erythromycin)

                        
                           Streptococcus pneumoniae
                        
                        
                           Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Eaton Agent, PPLO)

                        
                           Haemophilus influenzae (not all strains of this organism are susceptible at the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved)

                        
                           Treponema pallidum
                        
                        
                           Corynebacterium diphtheriae
                        
                        
                           Neisseria gonorrhoeae
                        
                        
                           Chlamydia trachomatis
