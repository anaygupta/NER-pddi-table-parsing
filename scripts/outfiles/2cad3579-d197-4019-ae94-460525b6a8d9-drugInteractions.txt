                            Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Coadministration may increase systemic exposure to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Reduce tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules dose to 2 mg once daily. (7.2)
                            Other Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects.

                        Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate-release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in Cmax and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see

                           ]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see

                        Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean Cmax and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.
                        For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily [see

                        No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [see

                           In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate-release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see

                        Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied.

                        The concomitant use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects.
