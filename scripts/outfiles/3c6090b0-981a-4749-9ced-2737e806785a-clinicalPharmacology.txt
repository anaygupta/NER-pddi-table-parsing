                        Systemic Absorption:
                      A systemic absorption study was performed in which Ciprofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution was administered in each eye every two hours while awake for two days followed by every four hours while awake for an additional 5 days. The maximum reported plasma concentration of ciprofloxacin was less than 5 ng/mL. The mean concentration was usually less than 2.5 ng/mL.
                  
                     
                        Microbiology:
                      Ciprofloxacin has 
                        in vitro
                      activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase which is needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both 
                        in vitro
                      and in clinical infections (SEE INDICATIONS AND USAGE section):

                        Chlamydia trachomatis
                      (only moderately susceptible) and 
                        Mycobacterium tuberculosis
                      (only moderately susceptible).
                  Most strains of 
                        Pseudomonas cepacia
                      and some strains of 
                        Pseudomonas maltophilia
                      are resistant to ciprofloxacin as are most anaerobic bacteria, including 
                        Bacteroides fragilis
                      and 
                        Clostridium difficile
                     . The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) generally does not exceed the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) by more than a factor of 2. Resistance to ciprofloxacin 
                        in vitro
                      usually develops slowly (multiple-step mutation).
                  Ciprofloxacin does not cross-react with other antimicrobial agents such as beta-lactams or aminoglycosides; therefore, organisms resistant to these drugs may be susceptible to ciprofloxacin.
                  
                     
                        Clinical Studies:
                      Following therapy with Ciprofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution, 76% of the patients with corneal ulcers and positive bacterial cultures were clinically cured and complete re-epithelialization occurred in about 92% of the ulcers. In 3 and 7 day multicenter clinical trials, 52% of the patients with conjunctivitis and positive conjunctival cultures were clinically cured and 70-80% had all causative pathogens eradicated by the end of treatment.
