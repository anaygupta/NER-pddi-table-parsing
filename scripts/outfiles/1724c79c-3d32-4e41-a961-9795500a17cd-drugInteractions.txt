                        Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted. Magnesium-containing antacids and doxercalciferol should not be used concomitantly because such use may lead to the development of hypermagnesemia (see

                           ). Although not examined specifically, enzyme inducers (such as glutethimide and phenobarbitol) may affect the 25-hydroxylation of doxercalciferol and may necessitate dosage adjustments. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole and erythromycin) may inhibit the 25-hydroxylation of doxercalciferol. Hence, formation of the active doxercalciferol moiety may be hindered.
