                              â€¢Omega-3 fatty acids may prolong bleeding time. Patients receiving treatment with EPANOVA and other drugs affecting coagulation (e.g., anti-platelet agents) should be monitored periodically.

                     7.1 Anticoagulants or Other Drugs Affecting Coagulation
                     
                        Patients taking anti-platelet agents or anticoagulants were excluded from EPANOVA clinical trials involving patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Some published studies with omega-3 fatty acids have demonstrated prolongation of bleeding time. The prolongation of bleeding time reported in those studies has not exceeded normal limits and did not produce clinically significant bleeding episodes. Nonetheless, patients receiving treatment with EPANOVA and drugs affecting coagulation (e.g., anti-platelet agents) should be monitored periodically.
