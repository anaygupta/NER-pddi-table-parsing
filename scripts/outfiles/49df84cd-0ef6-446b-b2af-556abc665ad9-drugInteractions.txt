                     7.1 Effects of rifaximin on cytochrome P450 enzymes
                     
                        studies have shown that rifaximin did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and CYP3A4 at concentrations ranging from 2 to 200 ng/mL . Rifaximin is not expected to inhibit these enzymes in clinical use.

                        An study has suggested that rifaximin induces CYP3A4 .  However, in patients with normal liver function, rifaximin at the recommended dosing regimen is not expected to induce CYP3A4.  It is unknown whether rifaximin can have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of concomitant CYP3A4 substrates in patients with reduced liver function who have elevated rifaximin concentrations.

                     7.2 Concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitors
                     
                        
                           An study suggested that rifaximin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein.  Co-administration of cyclosporine, a potent P-glycoprotein inhibitor, with rifaximin resulted in 83-fold    and  124-fold increases in rifaximin mean C  and AUC∞ in healthy subjects.  The clinical significance of this increase in systemic exposure is unknown .
