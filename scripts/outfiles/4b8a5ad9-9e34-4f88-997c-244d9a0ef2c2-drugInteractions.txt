                        Use of daunorubicin in a patient who has previously received doxorubicin increases the risk of cardiotoxicity. Daunorubicin hydrochloride should not be used in patients who have previously received the recommended maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin or daunorubicin hydrochloride. Cyclophosphamide used concurrently with daunorubicin hydrochloride may also result in increased cardiotoxicity.
                        Dosage reduction of daunorubicin hydrochloride may be required when used concurrently with other myelosuppressive agents.
                        Hepatotoxic medications, such as high-dose methotrexate, may impair liver function and increase the risk of toxicity.
