                  Dextromethorphan:Dextromethorphan is an antitussive agent and, unlike the isomeric 
levorphanol, it has no analgesic or addictive properties.
                  The drug acts centrally and elevates the threshold for coughing. It is about 
equal to codeine in depressing the cough reflex. In therapeutic dosage 
dextromethorphan does not inhibit ciliary activity.
                  Dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and 
exerts its effect in 15 to 30 minutes. The duration of action after oral 
administration is approximately three to six hours. Dextromethorphan is 
metabolized primarily by liver enzymes undergoing O-demethylation, 
N-demethylation, and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfate. In 
humans, (+)-3-hydroxy-N-methyl-morphinan, (+)-3-hydroxymorphinan, and traces of 
unmetabolized drug were found in urine after oral administration.
                  
                  Promethazine:Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative which differs 
structurally from the antipsychotic phenothiazines by the presence of a branched 
side chain and no ring substitution. It is thought that this configuration is 
responsible for its relative lack (1/10 that of chlorpromazine) of dopamine 
antagonist properties.
                  Promethazine is an H1 receptor blocking agent. In 
addition to its antihistaminic action, it provides clinically useful sedative 
and antiemetic effects.
                  Promethazine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical 
effects are apparent within 20 minutes after oral administration and generally 
last four to six hours, although they may persist as long as 12 hours. 
Promethazine is metabolized by the liver to a variety of compounds; the 
sulfoxides of promethazine and N-demethylpromethazine are the predominant 
metabolites appearing in the urine.
