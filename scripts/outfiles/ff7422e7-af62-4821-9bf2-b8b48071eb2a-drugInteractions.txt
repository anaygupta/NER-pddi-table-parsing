Pyridoxine hydrochloride should not be given to patients receiving the drug levodopa, because the action of levodopa is antagonized by pyridoxine hydrochloride. However, pyridoxine hydrochloride may be used concurrently in patients receiving a preparation containing both carbidopa and levodopa.

• High dose folic acid may result in decreased serum levels for pyrimethamine and first-generation anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, valproic acid, valproate).
• Folic acid may decrease a patient's response to methotrexate.
• 5-formyltetrahydrofolate may increase the toxicity of Capecitabine.
