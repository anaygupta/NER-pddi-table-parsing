12.1 Mechanism of Action 

                     
                     
                        
                           
                              

                           Polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is an osmotic agent, causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract.
                        Bisacodyl is hydrolyzed by intestinal brush border enzymes and colonic bacteria to form an active metabolite [bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl) pyridyl-2 methane; (BHPM)] that acts directly on the colonic mucosa to produce colonic peristalsis.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                        12.2 Pharmacodynamics

                     
                     
                        The stimulant laxative effect of bisacodyl, together with the osmotic effect of the unabsorbed PEG when ingested with a large volume of water, produces watery diarrhea.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                        12.3 PharmacoKinetics 

                     
                     
                        When taken orally, PEG 3350 is minimally absorbed.
                        Bisacodyl, which is a prodrug, is converted to its active metabolite BHPM by intestinal brush border enzymes and colonic bacteria. The pharmacokinetics of bisacodyl following oral administration of the bisacodyl tablet has not been adequately characterized.
