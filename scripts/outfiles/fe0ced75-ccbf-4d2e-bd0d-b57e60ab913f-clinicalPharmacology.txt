                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
							
                     
                        AGGRASTAT is a reversible antagonist of fibrinogen binding to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, the major platelet surface receptor involved in platelet aggregation. When administered intravenously, AGGRASTAT inhibits ex vivo platelet aggregation in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner.
                        When given according to the PRISM-PLUS regimen of 0.4 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes followed by a 0.1 mcg/kg/min maintenance infusion, >90% inhibition of platelet aggregation is attained by the end of the 30-minute infusion. When given according to the recommended regimen of 25 mcg/kg followed by a 0.15 mcg/kg/min maintenance infusion, >90% inhibition of platelet aggregation is attained within 10 minutes. Platelet aggregation inhibition is reversible following cessation of the infusion of AGGRASTAT.  
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
							
                     
                        AGGRASTAT inhibits platelet function, as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit ex vivo adenosine phosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time in healthy subjects and patients with coronary artery disease. The time course of inhibition parallels the plasma concentration profile of the drug.
                        Following discontinuation of an infusion of AGGRASTAT 0.10 mcg/kg/min, ex vivo platelet aggregation returns to near baseline in 4 to 8 hours in approximately 90% of patients with coronary artery disease. The addition of heparin to this regimen does not significantly alter the percentage of subjects with >70% inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA), but does increase the average bleeding time, as well as the number of patients with bleeding times prolonged to >30 minutes.  Similar platelet aggregation recovery rates are observed following discontinuation of a 0.15 mcg/kg/min infusion.

                        Tirofiban has a half-life of approximately 2 hours. It is cleared from the plasma largely by renal excretion, with about 65% of an administered dose appearing in urine and about 25% in feces, both largely as unchanged tirofiban. Metabolism appears to be limited. 
                        Tirofiban is not highly bound to plasma proteins and protein binding is concentration independent over the range of 0.01 to 25 mcg/mL. The unbound fraction in human plasma is 35%. The steady state volume of distribution of tirofiban ranges from 22 to 42 liters. 
                        In healthy subjects, the plasma clearance of tirofiban ranges from 213 to 314 mL/min. Renal clearance accounts for 39 to 69% of plasma clearance. 
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Special Populations
                           
                           
                              There is no effect on clearance of tirofiban by sex, race, age, or hepatic impairment.

                              Plasma clearance of tirofiban is decreased about 40% in subjects with creatinine clearance <60 mL/min and >50% in patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, including patients requiring hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Tirofiban is removed by hemodialysis.
