                  Activation of beta2-adrenergic receptors 
on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylcyclase and to an 
increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3′, 5′-adenosine 
monophosphate (cyclic AMP). This increase in cyclic AMP leads to the activation 
of protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers 
intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in relaxation. 
Levalbuterol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the 
terminal bronchioles. Levalbuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the 
airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all 
bronchoconstrictor challenges. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also 
associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the 
airway.
                  While it is recognized that beta2-adrenergic receptors 
are the predominant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that 
there is a population of beta2-receptors in the human 
heart that comprise between 10% and 50% of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. 
The precise function of these receptors has not been established (see 
                        WARNINGS
                     ). However, all 
beta-adrenergic agonist drugs can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in 
some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or 
electrocardiographic changes.
                  
                  Preclinical StudiesResults from an in vitro study of 
binding to human beta-adrenergic receptors demonstrated that levalbuterol has 
approximately 2-fold greater binding affinity than racemic albuterol and 
approximately 100-fold greater binding affinity than (S)-albuterol. In guinea 
pig airways, levalbuterol HCl and racemic albuterol decreased the response to 
spasmogens (e.g., acetylcholine and histamine), whereas (S)-albuterol was 
ineffective. These results suggest that the bronchodilatory effects of racemic 
albuterol are attributable to the (R)-enantiomer.
                  Intravenous studies in rats with racemic albuterol sulfate have demonstrated 
that albuterol crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches brain concentrations 
amounting to approximately 5.0% of the plasma concentrations. In structures 
outside the blood-brain barrier (pineal and pituitary glands), albuterol 
concentrations were found to be 100 times those in the whole brain.
                  Studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) have demonstrated 
the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death (with histologic evidence 
of myocardial necrosis) when beta-agonists and methylxanthines are administered 
concurrently. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.
                  
                  Pharmacokinetics (Adults and Adolescents ≥12 years 
old)The inhalation pharmacokinetics of Xopenex Inhalation Solution 
were investigated in a randomized cross-over study in 30 healthy adults 
following administration of a single dose of 1.25 mg and a cumulative dose of 5 
mg of Xopenex Inhalation Solution and a single dose of 2.5 mg and a cumulative 
dose of 10 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution by nebulization 
using a PARI LC Jet™ nebulizer with a Dura-Neb® 2000 
compressor.
                  Following administration of a single 1.25 mg dose of Xopenex Inhalation 
Solution, exposure to (R)-albuterol (AUC of 3.3 ng•hr/mL) was approximately 
2-fold higher than following administration of a single 2.5 mg dose of racemic 
albuterol inhalation solution (AUC of 1.7 ng•hr/mL) (see 
                        Table 1
                     ). Following administration of a cumulative 5 mg 
dose of Xopenex Inhalation Solution (1.25 mg given every 30 minutes for a total 
of four doses) or a cumulative 10 mg dose of racemic albuterol inhalation 
solution (2.5 mg given every 30 minutes for a total of four doses), Cmax and AUC of (R)-albuterol were comparable (see 
                        Table 1
                     ).

                  Pharmacokinetics (Children 6–11 years old)The pharmacokinetic parameters of (R)- and (S)-albuterol in 
children with asthma were obtained using population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
These data are presented in 
                        Table 2
                     . 
For comparison, adult data obtained by conventional pharmacokinetic analysis 
from a different study also are presented in 
                        Table 2
                     .
                  In children, AUC and Cmax of (R)-albuterol following 
administration of 0.63 mg Xopenex Inhalation Solution were comparable to those 
following administration of 1.25 mg racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation 
solution.
                  When the same dose of 0.63 mg of Xopenex was given to children and adults, 
the predicted Cmax of (R)–albuterol in children was 
similar to that in adults (0.52 vs. 0.56 ng/mL), while predicted AUC in children 
(2.55 ng•hr/mL) was about 1.5-fold higher than that in adults (1.65 ng•hr/mL). 
These data support lower doses for children 6-11 years old compared with the 
adult doses (see 
                        DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION
                     ).

                  Metabolism and EliminationInformation available in the published literature suggests that 
the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of albuterol enantiomers in 
humans is SULT1A3 (sulfotransferase). When racemic albuterol was administered 
either intravenously or via inhalation after oral charcoal administration, there 
was a 3- to 4-fold difference in the area under the concentration-time curves 
between the (R)- and (S)-albuterol enantiomers, with (S)-albuterol 
concentrations being consistently higher. However, without charcoal 
pretreatment, after either oral or inhalation administration the differences 
were 8- to 24-fold, suggesting that (R)-albuterol is preferentially metabolized 
in the gastrointestinal tract, presumably by SULT1A3.
                  The primary route of elimination of albuterol enantiomers is through renal 
excretion (80% to 100%) of either the parent compound or the primary metabolite. 
Less than 20% of the drug is detected in the feces. Following intravenous 
administration of racemic albuterol, between 25% and 46% of the (R)-albuterol 
fraction of the dose was excreted as unchanged (R)-albuterol in the urine.
                  
                  Special Populations
                  
                     Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Xopenex Inhalation Solution has not been 
evaluated.
                  
                  
                     Renal Impairment: The effect of renal 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of racemic albuterol was evaluated in 5 
subjects with creatinine clearance of 7 to 53 mL/min, and the results were 
compared with those from healthy volunteers. Renal disease had no effect on the 
half-life, but there was a 67% decline in racemic albuterol clearance. Caution 
should be used when administering high doses of Xopenex Inhalation Solution to 
patients with renal impairment.
                  
                  Pharmacodynamics (Adults and Adolescents ≥12 years 
old)In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over 
study, 20 adults with mild-to-moderate asthma received single doses of Xopenex 
Inhalation Solution (0.31, 0.63, and 1.25 mg) and racemic albuterol sulfate 
inhalation solution (2.5 mg). All doses of active treatment produced a 
significantly greater degree of bronchodilation (as measured by percent change 
from pre-dose mean FEV1) than placebo, and there were no 
significant differences between any of the active treatment arms. The 
bronchodilator responses to 1.25 mg of Xopenex Inhalation Solution and 2.5 mg of 
racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution were clinically comparable over 
the 6-hour evaluation period, except for a slightly longer duration of action 
(>15% increase in FEV1 from baseline) after 
administration of 1.25 mg of Xopenex Inhalation Solution. Systemic 
beta-adrenergic adverse effects were observed with all active doses and were 
generally dose-related for (R)-albuterol. Xopenex Inhalation Solution at a dose 
of 1.25 mg produced a slightly higher rate of systemic beta-adrenergic adverse 
effects than the 2.5 mg dose of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation 
solution.
                  In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 12 
adults with mild-to-moderate asthma were challenged with inhaled methacholine 
chloride 20 and 180 minutes following administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg 
of racemic albuterol sulfate, 1.25 mg of Xopenex, 1.25 mg of (S)-albuterol, or 
placebo using a PARI LC Jet™ nebulizer. Racemic albuterol sulfate, Xopenex, and 
(S)-albuterol had a protective effect against methacholine-induced 
bronchoconstriction 20 minutes after administration, although the effect of 
(S)-albuterol was minimal. At 180 minutes after administration, the 
bronchoprotective effect of 1.25 mg of Xopenex was comparable to that of 2.5 mg 
of racemic albuterol sulfate. At 180 minutes after administration, 1.25 mg of 
(S)-albuterol had no bronchoprotective effect.
                  In a clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate asthma, comparable 
efficacy (as measured by change from baseline FEV1) and 
safety (as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, serum potassium, and 
tremor) were demonstrated after a cumulative dose of 5 mg of Xopenex Inhalation 
Solution (four consecutive doses of 1.25 mg administered every 30 minutes) and 
10 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution (four consecutive doses 
of 2.5 mg administered every 30 minutes).
