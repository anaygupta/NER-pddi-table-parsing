                        The risk of using venlafaxine in combination with other CNS-active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised when venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release is taken in combination with other CNS-active drugs.

                        Adverse reactions, some of which were serious, have been reported in patients who have recently been discontinued from an MAOI and started on antidepressants with pharmacological properties similar to venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release (SNRIs or SSRIs), or who have recently had SNRI or SSRI therapy discontinued prior to initiation of an MAOI [see Dosage and Administration (2.9), Contraindications (4.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)
                           ].

                        Based on the mechanism of action of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, SSRIs, other SNRIs, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. John's wort. If concomitant treatment with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release and these drugs is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. The concomitant use of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release with tryptophan supplements is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.9), Contraindications (4.2), and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)
                           ].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4  Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)
                     
                        Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. The use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake is associated with the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)
                           ]. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release is initiated or discontinued.

                        The safety and efficacy of venlafaxine therapy in combination with weight loss agents, including phentermine, have not been established. Coadministration of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release and weight loss agents is not recommended. Venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release is not indicated for weight loss alone or in combination with other products.

                     7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions
                     
                        False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine have been reported in patients taking venlafaxine. This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of venlafaxine therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish venlafaxine from PCP and amphetamine.
