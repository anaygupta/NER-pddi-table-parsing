                  Aminosyn-HBC 7%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection â€” high branched chain) provides a mixture of biologically utilizable essential and nonessential crystalline amino acids in concentrated form for protein synthesis. The solution contains a high (45%) concentration of the branched chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine and valine) relative to other general purpose amino acid injections. Aminosyn-HBC 7%, when mixed with a concentrated source of calories such as hypertonic dextrose, supplemented with appropriate electrolytes, vitamins and trace metals and infused by central vein with or without fat emulsion, provides total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for the severely compromised patient.
                  Aminosyn-HBC 7% may also be administered peripherally with minimal caloric supplementation in order to conserve lean body mass in the well-nourished, mildly catabolic patient.
                  A high concentration of the branched chain amino acids is present in Aminosyn-HBC 7% because these amino acids have been reported to be metabolically active in the compromised patient.
                  The acetate content of the solution, under conditions of parenteral nutrition, would not be expected to affect acid-base status adversely when renal and respiratory functions are normal; confirmatory clinical/experimental evidence is not available. The amount of sodium present is not clinically significant. The concentration of chloride present is typical for TPN regimens.
