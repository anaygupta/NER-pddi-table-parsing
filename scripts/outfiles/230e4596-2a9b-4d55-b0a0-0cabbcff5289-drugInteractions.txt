                        The active ingredient of UCERIS rectal foam, budesonide, is metabolized by CYP3A4. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, cyclosporine and grapefruit juice) can increase systemic budesonide concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors with UCERIS rectal foam [see Clinical Pharmacology (
