                           Antacids
                        
                        The simultaneous oral administration of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, USP with nonabsorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives may reduce the resin’s potassium exchange capability.
                        
                           Non-absorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives
                        
                        Systemic alkalosis has been reported after cation-exchange resins were administered orally in combination with nonabsorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum carbonate. Magnesium hydroxide should not be administered with Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, USP. One case of grand mal seizure has been reported in a patient with chronic hypocalcemia of renal failure who was given Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, USP with magnesium hydroxide as a laxative.
                        Intestinal obstruction due to concretions of aluminum hydroxide when used in combination with Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, USP has been reported.
                        
                           Digitalis 
                        
                        The toxic effects of digitalis on the heart, especially various ventricular arrhythmias and A-V nodal dissociation, are likely to be exaggerated by hypokalemia, even in the face of serum digoxin concentrations in the “normal range”. (See WARNINGS).
                        
                           Sorbitol
                        
                        Concomitant use of Sorbitol with Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, USP has been implicated in cases of intestinal necrosis, which may be fatal. Therefore, concomitant administration is not recommended. (See WARNINGS).
                        
                           Lithium
                        
                        Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, USP may decrease absorption of lithium.
                        
                           Thyroxine
                        
                        Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, USP may decrease absorption of thyroxine.

                        Studies have not been performed.
                        
                           Pregnancy Category C
                        
                        Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, USP. It is also not known whether Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
