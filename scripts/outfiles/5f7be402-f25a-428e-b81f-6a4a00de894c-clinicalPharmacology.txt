                  In humans, sorbitol is nontoxic and rapidly metabolized. Sorbitol will either be excreted in the urine by the kidneys, or metabolized to carbon dioxide and dextrose.
                  When sorbitol is absorbed intravascularly in amounts which depend primarily on the extent of the surgery, it produces osmotic diuresis.
                  As a 3.3% solution, sorbitol is recommended for irrigation of the urinary bladder and prostatic bed during transurethral prostatectomy. Unlike dextrose solutions, sorbitol solutions are not sticky, and if administered in the above dilution, are not hemolytic.
                  Sorbitol is nonelectrolytic and is therefore nonconductive making it suitable for urologic irrigation during electrosurgical procedures.
