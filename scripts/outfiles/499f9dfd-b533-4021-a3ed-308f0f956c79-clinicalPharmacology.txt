                  Orally administered Nitrofurantoin is readily absorbed and rapidly excreted in urine.  Blood concentrations at therapeutic dosage are usually low.  It is highly soluble in urine, to which it may impart a brown color.
                  Following a dose regimen of 100 mg q.i.d. for 7 days, average urinary drug recoveries (0-24 hours) on day 1 and day 7 were 42.7% and 43.6%.
                  Unlike many drugs, the presence of food or agents delaying gastric emptying can increase the bioavailability of Nitrofurantoin, presumably by allowing better dissolution in gastric juices.
