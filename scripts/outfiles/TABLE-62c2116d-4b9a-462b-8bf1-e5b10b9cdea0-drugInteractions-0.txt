<paragraph>If coadministration of methadone and didanosine is necessary, the recommended formulation of didanosine is didanosine delayed-release capsules. Patients should be closely monitored for adequate clinical response when didanosine is coadministered with methadone, including monitoring for changes in HIV RNA viral load. Do not coadminister methadone with didanosine pediatric powder due to significant decreases in didanosine concentrations.</paragraph>

<paragraph>A dose reduction of didanosine to the following dosage once daily taken together with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a light meal (400 kcalories or less and 20% fat or less) or in the fasted state is recommended.<footnote id="_Refid-152f358f-a170-496f-8768-26f150d67">Coadministration of didanosine with food decreases didanosine concentrations. Thus, although not studied, it is possible that coadministration with heavier meals could reduce didanosine concentrations further.</footnote>
