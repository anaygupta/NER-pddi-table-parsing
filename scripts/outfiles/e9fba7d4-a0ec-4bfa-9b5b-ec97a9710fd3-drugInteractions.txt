                        LYSODREN is a strong inducer of cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements for the concomitant drug when administering LYSODREN to patients receiving drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4. 
                        LYSODRENâ€™s CYP induction effect leads to an increase in dosage requirements for warfarin. Closely monitor patients for a change in anticoagulant dosage requirements when administering LYSODREN to patients receiving coumarin-type anticoagulants.
