                     [See Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3).]
                  
                  
                     VYTORIN
                  
                  
                  
                  7.1 CYP3A4 InteractionsThe risk of myopathy is increased by reducing the elimination of 
the simvastatin component of VYTORIN. Hence when VYTORIN is used with an 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e.g., as listed below), elevated plasma levels of HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitory activity can increase the risk of myopathy and 
rhabdomyolysis, particularly with higher doses of VYTORIN. [See Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1) and Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3).]
                  
                  
                     Itraconazole, ketoconazole, and other antifungal 
azoles
                  
                  
                     Macrolide antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, and 
the ketolide antibiotic telithromycin
                  
                  
                     HIV protease inhibitors
                  
                  
                     Antidepressant nefazodone
                  
                  
                     Grapefruit juice in large quantities (>1 quart 
daily)
                  
                  Concomitant use of these drugs and any medication labeled as having a strong 
inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 should be avoided unless the benefits of combined 
therapy outweigh the increased risk. If treatment with itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin or telithromycin is unavoidable, 
therapy with VYTORIN should be suspended during the course of treatment.
                  
                  
                  7.2 Lipid-Lowering Drugs That Can Cause Myopathy When 
Given AloneThe risk of myopathy is increased by gemfibrozil and to a lesser 
extent by other fibrates [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1)].
                  
                  
                  7.3 Amiodarone, Verapamil, or DiltiazemThe risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant 
administration of amiodarone, verapamil, or diltiazem with higher doses of 
VYTORIN [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1)].
                  
                  
                  7.4 NiacinCases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been observed with 
simvastatin coadministered with lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day niacin) of 
niacin-containing products. In particular, caution should be used when treating 
Chinese patients with VYTORIN coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of 
niacin-containing products. Because the risk for myopathy is dose-related, 
Chinese patients should not receive VYTORIN 10/80 mg coadministered with 
lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products. [See Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1).]
                  
                  
                  
                  7.5 CholestyramineConcomitant cholestyramine administration decreased the mean AUC 
of total ezetimibe approximately 55%. The incremental LDL-C reduction due to 
adding VYTORIN to cholestyramine may be reduced by this interaction.
                  
                  
                  7.6 Cyclosporine or DanazolThe risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant 
administration of cyclosporine or danazol particularly with higher doses of 
VYTORIN [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1) and Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  Caution should be exercised when using VYTORIN and cyclosporine concomitantly 
due to increased exposure to both ezetimibe and cyclosporine [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.7)]. Cyclosporine concentrations should be 
monitored in patients receiving VYTORIN and cyclosporine [see Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  The degree of increase in ezetimibe exposure may be greater in patients with 
severe renal impairment. In patients treated with cyclosporine, the potential 
effects of the increased exposure to ezetimibe from concomitant use should be 
carefully weighed against the benefits of alterations in lipid levels provided 
by ezetimibe. [See Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1) and Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3).]
                  
                  
                  
                  7.7 DigoxinIn one study, concomitant administration of digoxin with 
simvastatin resulted in a slight elevation in plasma digoxin concentrations. 
Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately when VYTORIN is 
initiated.
                  
                  
                  7.8 FibratesThe safety and effectiveness of VYTORIN administered with 
fibrates have not been established.
                  Fibrates may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to 
cholelithiasis. In a preclinical study in dogs, ezetimibe increased cholesterol 
in the gallbladder bile [see Animal 
Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (13.2)]. Coadministration of VYTORIN 
with fibrates is not recommended until use in patients is studied. [See Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1).]
                  
                  
                  
                  7.9 Coumarin AnticoagulantsSimvastatin 20-40 mg/day modestly potentiated the effect of 
coumarin anticoagulants: the prothrombin time, reported as International 
Normalized Ratio (INR), increased from a baseline of 1.7 to 1.8 and from 2.6 to 
3.4 in a normal volunteer study and in a hypercholesterolemic patient study, 
respectively. With other statins, clinically evident bleeding and/or increased 
prothrombin time has been reported in a few patients taking coumarin 
anticoagulants concomitantly. In such patients, prothrombin time should be 
determined before starting VYTORIN and frequently enough during early therapy to 
ensure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occurs. Once a stable 
prothrombin time has been documented, prothrombin times can be monitored at the 
intervals usually recommended for patients on coumarin anticoagulants. If the 
dose of VYTORIN is changed or discontinued, the same procedure should be 
repeated. Simvastatin therapy has not been associated with bleeding or with 
changes in prothrombin time in patients not taking anticoagulants.
                  Concomitant administration of ezetimibe (10 mg once daily) had no significant 
effect on bioavailability of warfarin and prothrombin time in a study of twelve 
healthy adult males. There have been post-marketing reports of increased INR in 
patients who had ezetimibe added to warfarin. Most of these patients were also 
on other medications.
                  The effect of VYTORIN on the prothrombin time has not been studied.
