                     12.1  Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Gadobenate dimeglumine is a paramagnetic agent and, as such, develops a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field. The large magnetic moment produced by the paramagnetic agent results in a large local magnetic field, which can enhance the relaxation rates of water protons in its vicinity leading to an increase of signal intensity (brightness) of tissue. 
                        In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with 1) differences in proton density; 2) differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1); and 3) differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T2). When placed in a magnetic field, gadobenate dimeglumine decreases the T1 and T2 relaxation time in target tissues. At recommended doses, the effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in the T1-weighted sequences.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2  Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Unlike other tested paramagnetic contrast agents (See Table 3), MultiHance demonstrates weak and transient interactions with serum proteins that causes slowing in the molecular tumbling dynamics, resulting in strong increases in relaxivity in solutions containing serum proteins. The improved relaxation effect can contribute to increased contrast-to-noise ratio and lesion-to-brain ratio, which may improve visualization.
                        


                        


MultiHance injection does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier and, therefore, does not enhance normal brain or lesions that have a normal blood-brain barrier, e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars. However, disruption of the blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity allows enhancement by MultiHance of lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and infarcts. Uptake of MultiHance into hepatocytes has been demonstrated.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3  Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Three single-dose intravenous studies were conducted in 32 healthy male subjects to assess the pharmacokinetics of gadobenate dimeglumine. The doses administered in these studies ranged from 0.005 to 0.4 mmol/kg. Upon injection, the meglumine salt is completely dissociated from the gadobenate dimeglumine complex. Thus, the pharmacokinetics is based on the assay of gadobenate ion, the MRI contrast effective ion in gadobenate dimeglumine. Data for plasma concentration and area under the curve demonstrated linear dependence on the administered dose. The pharmacokinetics of gadobenate ion following intravenous administration can be best described using a two-compartment model.
                        
                           
                              Distribution
                           
                           
 Gadobenate ion has a rapid distribution half-life (reported as mean ± SD) of 0.084 ± 0.012 to 0.605 ± 0.072 hours. Volume of distribution of the central compartment ranged from 0.074 ± 0.017 to 0.158 ± 0.038 L/kg, and estimates of volume of distribution by area ranged from 0.170 ± 0.016 to 0.282 ± 0.079 L/kg. These latter estimates are approximately equivalent to the average volume of extracellular body water in man. In vitro studies showed no appreciable binding of gadobenate ion to human serum proteins.
                        
                           
                              Elimination
                           
                           
 Gadobenate ion is eliminated predominately via the kidneys, with 78% to 96% of an administered dose recovered in the urine. Total plasma clearance and renal clearance estimates of gadobenate ion were similar, ranging from 0.093 ± 0.010 to 0.133 ± 0.270 L/hr/kg and 0.082 ± 0.007 to 0.104 ± 0.039 L/hr/kg, respectively. The clearance is similar to that of substances that are subject to glomerular filtration. The mean elimination half-life ranged from 1.17 ± 0.26 to 2.02 ± 0.60 hours. A small percentage of the administered dose (0.6% to 4%) is eliminated via the biliary route and recovered in feces.
                        
                           
                              Metabolism
                           
                           
 There was no detectable biotransformation of gadobenate ion. Dissociation of gadobenate ion in vivo has been shown to be minimal, with less than 1% of the free chelating agent being recovered alone in feces.

                                 Renal Impairment:
                              
                            A single intravenous dose of 0.2 mmol/kg of MultiHance was administered to 20 subjects with impaired renal function (6 men and 3 women with moderate renal impairment [urine creatinine clearance >30 to <60 mL/min] and 5 men and 6 women with severe renal impairment [urine creatinine clearance >10 to <30 mL/min]). Mean estimates of the elimination half-life were 6.1 ± 3.0 and 9.5 ± 3.1 hours for the moderate and severe renal impairment groups, respectively as compared with 1.0 to 2.0 hours in healthy volunteers. 
                        
                           
                              
                                 Hemodialysis:
                              
                            A single intravenous dose of 0.2 mmol/kg of MultiHance was administered to 11 subjects (5 males and 6 females) with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialyzability of gadobenate. Approximately 72% of the dose was recovered by hemodialysis over a 4-hour period. The mean elimination half-life on dialysis was 1.21 ± 0.29 hours as compared with 42.4 ± 24.4 hours when off dialysis.
                        
                           
                              
                                 Hepatic Impairment:
                              
                            A single intravenous dose of 0.1 mmol/kg of MultiHance was administered to 11 subjects (8 males and 3 females) with impaired liver function (Class B or C modified Child-Pugh Classification). Hepatic impairment had little effect on the pharmacokinetics of MultiHance with the parameters being similar to those calculated for healthy subjects.
                        
                           
                              
                                 Gender, Age, Race:
                              
                            A multiple regression analysis performed using pooled data from several pharmacokinetic studies found no significant effect of sex upon the pharmacokinetics of gadobenate. Clearance appeared to decrease slightly with increasing age. Since variations due to age appeared marginal, dosage adjustment for geriatric population is not recommended. Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been systematically studied.

                            A population pharmacokinetic analysis incorporated data from 25 healthy subjects (14 males and 11 females) and 15 subjects undergoing MR imaging of the central nervous system (7 males and 8 females) between ages of 2 and 16 years. The subjects received a single intravenous dose of 0.1 mmol/kg of MultiHance. The geometric mean Cmax was 62.3 μg/mL (n=16) in children 2 to 5 years of age, and 64.2 μg/mL (n=24) in children older than 5 years. The geometric mean AUC 0-∞ was 77.9 μg-h/mL in children 2-5 years of age (n=16) and 82.6 μg-h/mL in children older than 5 years (n=24). The geometric mean half-life was 1.2 hours in children 2 to 5 years of age and 0.93 hours in children older than 5 years. There was no significant gender-related difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters in the pediatric patients. Over 80% of the dose was recovered in urine after 24 hours.
