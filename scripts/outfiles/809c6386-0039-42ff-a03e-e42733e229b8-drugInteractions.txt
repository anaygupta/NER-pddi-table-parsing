                                 Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs
                              
                           
                           
                              Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Observe patients treated with metoprolol plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. In addition, possibly significant hypertension may theoretically occur up to 14 days following discontinuation of the concomitant administration with an irreversible MAO inhibitor.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Digitalis Glycosides and Beta-Blockers
                              
                           
                           
                              Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and PR interval.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Calcium Channel Blockers
                              
                           
                           
                              Concomitant administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with a calcium channel blocker may produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility because of negative chronotropic and inotropic effects.
