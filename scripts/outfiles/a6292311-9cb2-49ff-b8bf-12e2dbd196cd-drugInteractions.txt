                              Strong and moderate CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors: Increase exposure to cilostazol. Reduce cilostazol dose (2.2, 7.1)

                           Inhibitors of CYP3A4
                        
                        Coadministration of strong (e.g., ketoconazole) and moderate (e.g., erythromycin, diltiazem and grapefruit juice) CYP3A4
                        inhibitors can increase exposure to cilostazol. Reduce cilostazol dose to 50 mg twice daily when coadministered with
                        strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 [see Dosage and Administration (
                           
                              2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                        
                           Inhibitors of CYP2C19
                        
                        Coadministration with CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) increases systemic exposure of cilostazol active
                        metabolites. Reduce cilostazol dose to 50 mg twice daily when coadministered with strong or moderate inhibitors of
                        CYP2C19 [see Dosage and Administration (
                           
                              2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
