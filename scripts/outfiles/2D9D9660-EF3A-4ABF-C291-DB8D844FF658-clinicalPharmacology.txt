CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
GeneralPropranolol
is a nonselective, beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agent possessing
no other autonomic nervous system activity. It specifically competes
with beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulating agents for available receptor
sites. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol,
the chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic
stimulation are decreased proportionately. At dosages greater than
required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like
or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action
potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment
of arrhythmias is uncertain.  Inderal LA should not be considered a simple mg-for-mg substitute
for conventional propranolol and the blood levels achieved do not
match (are lower than) those of two to four times daily dosing with
the same dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). When changing to
Inderal LA from conventional propranolol, a possible need for retitration
upwards should be considered, especially to maintain effectiveness
at the end of the dosing interval. In most clinical settings, however,
such as hypertension or angina where there is little correlation between
plasma levels and clinical effect, Inderal LA has been therapeutically
equivalent to the same mg dose of conventional Inderal as assessed
by 24-hour effects on blood pressure and on 24-hour exercise responses
of heart rate, systolic pressure, and rate pressure product.DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). When changing to

Mechanism of Action 
The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of propranolol
has not been established. Among the factors that may be involved in
contributing to the antihypertensive action include: (1) decreased
cardiac output, (2) inhibition of renin release by the kidneys,
and (3) diminution of tonic sympathetic nerve outflow from vasomotor
centers in the brain. Although total peripheral resistance may increase
initially, it readjusts to or below the pretreatment level with chronic
use of propranolol. Effects of propranolol on plasma volume appear
to be minor and somewhat variable.  In angina
pectoris, propranolol generally reduces the oxygen requirement of
the heart at any given level of effort by blocking the catecholamine-induced
increases in the heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and the velocity
and extent of myocardial contraction. Propranolol may increase oxygen
requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length, end diastolic
pressure, and systolic ejection period. The net physiologic effect
of beta-adrenergic blockade is usually advantageous and is manifested
during exercise by delayed onset of pain and increased work capacity. Propranolol exerts its antiarrhythmic effects in concentrations
associated with beta-adrenergic blockade, and this appears to be its
principal antiarrhythmic mechanism of action. In dosages greater than
required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like
or anesthetic-like membrane action which affects the cardiac action
potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment
of arrhythmias is uncertain. The mechanism
of the anti-migraine effect of propranolol has not been established.
Beta‑adrenergic receptors have been demonstrated in the pial
vessels of the brain.
