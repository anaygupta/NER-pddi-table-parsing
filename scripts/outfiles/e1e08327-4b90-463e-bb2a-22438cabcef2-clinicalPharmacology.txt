                  After oral administration, cycloserine is readily absorbed from 
the gastrointestinal tract, with peak blood levels occurring in 4 to 8 hours. 
Blood levels of 25 to 30 μg/mL can generally be maintained with the usual dosage 
of 250 mg twice a day, although the relationship of plasma levels to dosage is 
not always consistent. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, 
fetal blood, and mother’s milk approach those found in the serum. Detectable 
amounts are found in ascitic fluid, bile, sputum, amniotic fluid, and lung and 
lymph tissues. Approximately 65 percent of a single dose of cycloserine can be 
recovered in the urine within 72 hours after oral administration. The remaining 
35 percent is apparently metabolized to unknown substances. The maximum 
excretion rate occurs 2 to 6 hours after administration, with 50 percent of the 
drug eliminated in 12 hours.
