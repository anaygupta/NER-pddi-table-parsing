                        Large doses of naloxone are required to antagonize
buprenorphine since the latter has a long duration of action due to
its slow rate of binding and subsequent slow dissociation from the
opioid receptor. Buprenorphine antagonism is characterized by a gradual
onset of the reversal effects and a decreased duration of action of
the normally prolonged respiratory depression. The barbiturate methohexital
appears to block the acute onset of withdrawal symptoms induced by
naloxone in opiate addicts.
