Serum level studies with a 
150 mg oral dose of clindamycin hydrochloride in 24 normal adult volunteers 
showed that clindamycin was rapidly absorbed after oral administration. An 
average peak serum level of 2.5 mcg/mL was reached in 45 minutes; serum levels 
averaged 1.51 mcg/mL at 3 hours and 0.7 mcg/mL at 6 hours. Absorption of an oral 
dose is virtually complete (90%), and the concomitant administration of food 
does not appreciably modify the serum concentrations; serum levels have been 
uniform and predictable from person to person and dose to dose. Serum level 
studies following multiple doses of clindamycin hydrochloride for up to 14 days 
show no evidence of accumulation or altered metabolism of drug.
 
Serum 
half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients  with  markedly  
reduced renal function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective 
in removing clindamycin from the serum.
 
Concentrations of clindamycin in 
the serum increased linearly with increased dose. Serum levels exceed the MIC 
(minimum inhibitory concentration) for most indicated organisms for at least six 
hours following administration of the usually recommended doses. Clindamycin is 
widely distributed in body fluids and tissues (including bones). The average 
biological half-life is 2.4 hours. Approximately 10% of the bioactivity is 
excreted in the urine and 3.6% in the feces; the remainder is excreted as 
bioinactive metabolites.
 
Doses of up to 2 grams of clindamycin per day 
for 14 days have been well tolerated by healthy volunteers, except that the 
incidence of gastrointestinal side effects is greater with the higher 
doses.
 
No significant levels of clindamycin are attained in the 
cerebrospinal fluid, even in the presence of inflamed 
meninges.
 
Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61 to 79 years) 
and younger adults (18 to 39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter 
clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of 
distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV 
administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of 
clindamycin hydrochloride, elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4 
hours (range 3.4 to 5.1 h) in the elderly compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1 to 
4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different 
between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with 
normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function.
                  
                  Microbiology
Clindamycin inhibits bacterial 
protein synthesis by binding to the 50S subunit of the ribosome. It has activity 
against Gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes as well as the Gram-negative 
anaerobes. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic. Cross-resistance between clindamycin 
and lincomycin is complete. Antagonism in vitro has 
been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin.
 
Clindamycin has 
been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following 
microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical 
infections, as described in the 
                      INDICATIONS AND USAGE

                  Susceptibility Testing Methods
                     
NOTE: Susceptibility testing by dilution methods requires 
the use of clindamycin susceptibility powder.
 
When available, the 
results of in vitro susceptibility tests should be 
provided to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility 
profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid 
the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial.
 
Dilution 
Techniques
 
Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial 
minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the 
susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be 
determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on 
a dilution method (broth and agar)1,2,3 or equivalent 
with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of 
clindamycin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the 
criteria provided in Table 1.
 
Diffusion Techniques
 
Quantitative 
methods that require the measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible 
estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such 
standardized procedure2,3 requires the use of 
standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks 
impregnated with 2 mcg of clindamycin to test the susceptibility of 
microorganisms to clindamycin. The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are 
provided in Table 1.     

                  


                  




                  a These 
interpretive standards for S. pneumoniae and other 
Streptococcus spp. are applicable only to tests 
performed by broth microdilution using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with 
2 to 5% lysed horse blood inoculated with a direct colony suspension and 
incubated in ambient air at 35°C for 20 to 24 hours.

                  b 
These zone diameter interpretive standards are applicable only to tests 
performed using Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood inoculated 
with a direct colony suspension and incubated in 5% CO2 
at 35°C for 20 to 24 hours.

                  c These interpretive 
criteria are for all anaerobic bacterial pathogens; no organism specific 
interpretive criteria are available.
NA=Not applicable
 
A report of 
“Susceptible” indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the 
antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually 
achievable. A report of “Intermediate” indicates that the result should be 
considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to 
alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This 
category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is 
physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be 
used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small, 
uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in 
interpretation. A report of “Resistant” indicates that the pathogen is not 
likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the 
concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be 
selected.
 
Quality Control
 
Standardized susceptibility test 
procedures require the use of quality control microorganisms to control the 
technical aspects of the test procedures. Standard clindamycin powder should 
provide the following range of values noted in Table 2. NOTE: 
Quality control microorganisms are specific strains of organisms with 
intrinsic biological properties relating to resistance mechanisms and their 
genetic expression within bacteria; the specific strains used for 
microbiological quality control are not clinically significant.
