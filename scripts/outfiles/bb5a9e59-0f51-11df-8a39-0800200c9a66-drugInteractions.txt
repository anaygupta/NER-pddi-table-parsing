                  EXPAREL can be administered undiluted or diluted up to 0.89 mg/mL (i.e., 1:14 dilution by volume) with normal (0.9%) sterile saline for injection or lactated Ringerâ€™s solution.  EXPAREL must not be diluted with water or other hypotonic agents as it will result in disruption of the liposomal particles.
                  EXPAREL should not be admixed with other local anesthetics. 
                  EXPAREL may be locally administered after at least 20 minutes following local administration of lidocaine.
                  Bupivacaine HCl, when injected immediately before EXPAREL, may impact the pharmacokinetic and/or physicochemical properties of the drugs if the milligram dose of bupivacaine HCl solution exceeds 50% of the EXPAREL dose.  The toxic effects of these drugs are additive and their administration should be used with caution including monitoring for neurologic and cardiovascular effects related to toxicity [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Overdosage (10)].
                  EXPAREL should not be admixed with other drugs prior to administration.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           EXPAREL should not be admixed with lidocaine or other non-bupivacaine-based local anesthetics
                           EXPAREL may be administered after at least 20 minutes or more have elapsed following local administration of lidocaine.
                           Bupivacaine HCl, when injected immediately before or admixed with EXPAREL, may impact the pharmacokinetic and/or physicochemical properties of the drugs (7).
