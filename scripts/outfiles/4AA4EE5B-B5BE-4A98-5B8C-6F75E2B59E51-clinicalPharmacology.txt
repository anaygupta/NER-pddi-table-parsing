CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Cimetidine competitively inhibits the action of histamine
at the histamine H2 receptors of the parietal cells and thus is
a histamine H2-receptor antagonist.2 receptors of the parietal cells and thus is
a histamine HCimetidine
is not an anticholinergic agent. Studies have shown that cimetidine inhibits
both daytime and nocturnal basal gastric acid secretion. Cimetidine also inhibits
gastric acid secretion stimulated by food, histamine, pentagastrin, caffeine
and insulin.Antisecretory
ActivityAntisecretory
Activity Acid Secretion:Nocturnal: Cimetidine 800 mg orally at bedtime
reduces mean hourly H+ activity by greater than 85% over an eight-hour
period in duodenal ulcer patients, with no effect on daytime acid secretion.
Cimetidine 1600 mg orally h.s. produces 100% inhibition of mean hourly H+ activity
over an eight-hour period in duodenal ulcer patients, but also reduces H+ activity
by 35% for an additional five hours into the following morning. Cimetidine
400 mg b.i.d. and 300 mg q.i.d. decrease nocturnal acid secretion in a dose-related
manner, i.e., 47% to 83% over a six- to eight-hour period and 54% over a nine-hour
period, respectively. Acid Secretion:Nocturnal: Cimetidine 800 mg orally at bedtime

ulcer patients by at least 50%. During the subsequent two hours cimetidine

Stimulated: During the first hour after a standard experimental
meal, oral cimetidine 300 mg inhibited gastric acid secretion in duodenal
ulcer patients by at least 50%. During the subsequent two hours cimetidine
inhibited gastric acid secretion by at least 75%.
     The effect of a 300 mg breakfast dose of cimetidine continued for at
least four hours and there was partial suppression of the rise in gastric
acid secretion following the luncheon meal in duodenal ulcer patients. This
suppression of gastric acid output was enhanced and could be maintained by
another 300 mg dose of cimetidine given with lunch.
     In another study, cimetidine 300 mg given with the meal increased gastric
pH as compared with placebo.




24-Hour Mean H++ Activity: Cimetidine 800 mg h.s., 400 mg b.i.d. and 300 mg q.i.d. all provide
a similar, moderate (less than 60%) level of 24 hour acid suppression. However,
the 800 mg h.s. regimen exerts its entire effect on nocturnal acid, and does
not affect daytime gastric physiology.24-Hour Mean H++ Activity: Cimetidine 800 mg h.s., 400 mg b.i.d. and 300 mg q.i.d. all provide

is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and peak levels occur in 45
to 90 minutes. The half-life of cimetidine is approximately 2 hours. Both
oral and parenteral (I.V. or I.M.) administration provide comparable periods
of therapeutically effective blood levels; blood concentrations remain above
that required to provide 80% inhibition of basal gastric acid secretion for
4 to 5 hours following a dose of 300 mg.Steady-state
blood concentrations of cimetidine with continuous infusion of cimetidine
hydrochloride are determined by the infusion rate and clearance of the drug
in the individual patient. In a study of peptic ulcer patients with normal
renal function, an infusion rate of 37.5 mg/hour produced average steady-state
plasma cimetidine concentrations of about 0.9 mcg/mL. Blood levels with
other infusion rates will vary in direct proportion to the infusion rate.The
principal route of excretion of cimetidine is the urine. Following parenteral
administration, most of the drug is excreted as the parent compound; following
oral administration, the drug is more extensively metabolized, the sulfoxide
being the major metabolite. Following a single oral dose, 48% of the drug
is recovered from the urine after 24 hours as the parent compound. Following
I.V. or I.M. administration, approximately 75% of the drug is recovered from
the urine after 24 hours as the parent compound.Sodium
chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride
(Cl¯) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular
fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances.
Chloride (Cl¯) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and
carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and
excretion of sodium (Na+) are largely under the control of the
