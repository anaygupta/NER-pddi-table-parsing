                  TriOxin is effective both as an antibacterial and antifungal agent. The unique Hydrophilic Lipid based delivery system provides a suspension having an acid pH and a low surface tension, exerting a drying effect and allowing the medication to spread quickly to all contiguous surfaces, softening and reducing accumulated cerumen. Chloroxylenol is a halogenated phenol; non-toxic, non-corrosive, non-staining with high phenol coefficient. It may be applied directly to a wound and shows no chemical reactivity toward blood. TriOxin which contains hydrocortisone acetate is indicated when otitis is complicated by inflammation or to control itching. Benzocaine is a topical anesthetic with a low index of sensitization and toxicity.
