                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The pancreatic enzymes in VIOKACE catalyze the hydrolysis of fats to monoglycerides, glycerol and free fatty acids, proteins into peptides and amino acids, and starches into dextrins and short chain sugars such as maltose and maltriose in the duodenum and proximal small intestine, thereby acting like digestive enzymes physiologically secreted by the pancreas. 
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Pancreatic enzymes are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in appreciable amounts.
