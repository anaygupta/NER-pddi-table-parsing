                     In vitro data indicate that monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) is a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. In vitro data indicate that MMAE is also a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, or P-gp inhibitors, has the potential to affect the exposure to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) (7.1).

                           CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers: MMAE is primarily metabolized by CYP3A [see Clinical Pharmacology (

                              )].  Co-administration of ADCETRIS with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased exposure to MMAE by approximately 34%. Patients who are receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors concomitantly with ADCETRIS should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. Co-administration of ADCETRIS with rifampin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, reduced exposure to MMAE by approximately 46%. 
                        
                           P-gp Inhibitors: Co-administration of ADCETRIS with P-gp inhibitors may increase exposure to MMAE. Patients who are receiving P-gp inhibitors concomitantly with ADCETRIS should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.   
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Effect of ADCETRIS on Other Drugs
                     
                        Co-administration of ADCETRIS did not affect exposure to midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate. MMAE does not inhibit other CYP enzymes at relevant clinical concentrations  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

                              )].  ADCETRIS is not expected to alter the exposure to drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes.
