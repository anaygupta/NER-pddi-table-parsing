                  Methylphenidate is a mild central nervous system stimulant.
                  The mode of action in man is not completely understood, but methylphenidate 
presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its 
stimulant effect.
                  There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism 
whereby methylphenidate produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, 
nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of 
the central nervous system.
                  Methylphenidate hydrochloride in extended-release tablets is more slowly but 
as extensively absorbed as in the regular tablets. Bioavailability of the UCB 
methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablet was compared to a 
sustained-release reference product and an immediate-release product. The extent 
of absorption for the three products was similar, and the rate of absorption of 
the two sustained-release products was not statistically different.
In 
another reported study with a brand of Methylphenidate HCl sustained-release, 
the time to peak rate in children was reported as 4.7 hours (1.3 - 8.2 hours) 
for the sustained-release tablet dosage form and 1.9 hours (0.3 - 4.4 hours) for 
immediate release tablets. An average of 67% of a sustained-release tablet 
dosage form was excreted in children compared to 86% in adults.
                  In a clinical study involving adult subjects who received Extended-release 
(ER) tablets, plasma concentrations of methylphenidate hydrochloride’s major 
metabolite appeared to be greater in females than in males. No gender 
differences were observed for methylphenidate hydrochloride’s plasma 
concentration in the same subjects.
