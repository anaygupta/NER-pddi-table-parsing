                        Caution should be exercised when administering ETOPOPHOS with drugs that are known to inhibit phosphatase activities (e.g., levamisole hydrochloride). High-dose cyclosporin A resulting in concentrations above 2000 ng/mL administered with oral etoposide has led to an 80% increase in etoposide exposure with a 38% decrease in total body clearance of etoposide compared to etoposide alone.
                        Concomitant use of antiepileptic medications including phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and valproic acid is associated with increased etoposide clearance and reduced efficacy of ETOPOPHOS.
                        Concomitant warfarin therapy may result in elevated international normalized ratio (INR). Close monitoring of INR is recommended.
