               Drug Interactions andDrug-Food Interactions).Distribution 226 Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin(TBG), thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBA), whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higheraffinity of both TBG and TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance, and longer half-life ofT4 compared to T3. Protein-bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone. Only unboundhormone is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins(seePRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions andDrug-Laboratory Test Interactions). Thyroid hormones do not readily cross theplacental barrier (seePRECAUTIONS,
