                  Sulconazole nitrate is an imidazole derivative that inhibits the growth of the common pathogenic dermatophytes including Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Microsporum canis. It also inhibits the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur, and certain gram positive bacteria.
                  A maximization test with sulconazole nitrate solution showed no evidence of irritation or contact sensitization.
