                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Morphine, a full opioid agonist, is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can interact with other opioid receptors at higher doses.  In addition to analgesia, the widely diverse effects of morphine sulfate include drowsiness, changes in mood, respiratory depression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, and alterations of the endocrine and autonomic nervous system.
                        
                           
                              Effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS)
                           
                        
                        The principle therapeutic action of morphine is analgesia.  Other therapeutic effects of morphine include anxiolysis, euphoria and feelings of relaxation.  Although the precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown, specific CNS opiate receptors and endogenous compounds with morphine-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are likely to play a role in the expression and perception of analgesic effects.  In common with other opioids, morphine causes respiratory depression, in part by a direct effect on the brainstem respiratory centers.  Morphine and related opioids depress the cough reflect by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla.  Morphine causes miosis, even in total darkness. 
                        
                           
                              Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and on Other Smooth Muscle
                           
                        
                        Gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions are decreased by morphine.  Morphine causes a reduction in motility and is associated with an increase in tone in the antrum of the stomach duodenum.  Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased.  Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm.  The end result may be constipation.  Morphine can cause a marked increase in biliary tract pressure as a result of spasm of the sphincter of Oddi.  Morphine may also cause spasm of the sphincter of the urinary bladder.
                        
                           
                              Effects of the Cardiovascular System
                           
                        
                        In therapeutic doses, morphine does not usually exert major effects on the cardiovascular system.  Morphine produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension and fainting.  Release of histamine can occur, which may play a role in opioid-induced hypotension.  Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating.

                        Opioid agonists have been shown to have a variety of effects on the secretion of hormones.  Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, and luteinizing hormones (LH) in humans.  They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon in humans and other species, rats and dogs.  Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) has been shown to be both inhibited and simulated by opioids.

                        Morphine concentrations are not predictive of analgesic response, especially in patients previously treated with opioids.  The minimum effective concentration varies widely and is influenced by a variety of factors, including the extent of previous opioid use, age and general medical condition.  Effective doses in tolerant patients may be significantly higher than in opioid-naïve patients.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Morphine has an apparent volume of distribution ranging from 1.0 to 4.7 L/kg after parenteral administration. Protein binding is low, about 36%, and muscle tissue binding is reported as 54%. A blood-brain barrier exists, and when morphine is introduced outside of the CNS, plasma concentrations of morphine remain higher than the corresponding CSF morphine levels.
                        Morphine has a total plasma clearance which ranges from 0.9 to 1.2 L/kg/h in postoperative patients, but shows considerable interindividual variation. The major pathway of clearance is hepatic glucuronidation to morphine-3-glucuronide, which is pharmacologically inactive. The major excretion path of the conjugate is through the kidneys, with about 10% in the feces. Morphine is also eliminated by the kidneys, 2 to 12% being excreted unchanged in the urine. Terminal half-life is commonly reported to vary from 1.5 to 4.5 hours, although the longer half-lives were obtained when morphine levels were monitored over protracted periods with very sensitive radioimmunoassay methods. The accepted elimination half-life in normal subjects is 1.5 to 2 hours.
