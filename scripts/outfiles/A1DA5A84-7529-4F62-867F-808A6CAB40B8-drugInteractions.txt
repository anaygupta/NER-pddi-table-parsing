(A) HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors:  The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with combined gemfibrozil and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS). Myopathy or rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure have been reported as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy or after several months (refs. 8, 9, 10, 11). (SeeWARNINGSWARNINGS.) There is no assurance that periodic monitoring of creatine kinase will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy and kidney damage.HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors:  The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with combined gemfibrozil and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy (see(B) Anticoagulants: CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN ANTICOAGULANTS ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH GEMFIBROZIL. THE DOSAGE OF THE ANTICOAGULANT SHOULD BE REDUCED TO MAINTAIN THE PROTHROMBIN TIME AT THE DESIRED LEVEL TO PREVENT BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS. FREQUENT PROTHROMBIN DETERMINATIONS ARE ADVISABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY DETERMINED THAT THE PROTHROMBIN LEVEL HAS STABILIZED.Anticoagulants: CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN ANTICOAGULANTS ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH GEMFIBROZIL.

FREQUENT PROTHROMBIN DETERMINATIONS ARE ADVISABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY DETERMINED THAT THE PROTHROMBIN LEVEL HAS STABILIZED.(C) Repaglinide: In vivo data from a study that evaluated the co-administration of gemfibrozil with repaglinide in healthy subjects resulted in a significant increase in repaglinide blood levels. Patients taking repaglinide should not start taking gemfibrozil; patients taking gemfibrozil should not start taking repaglinide. Concomitant use may result in enhanced and prolonged blood glucose-lowering effects of repaglinide. Caution should be used in patients already on repaglinide and gemfibrozil – blood glucose levels should be monitored and repaglinide dose adjustment may be needed. Rare post marketing events of serious hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking repaglinide and gemfibrozil together. In this same study, gemfibrozil and itraconazole had a synergistic metabolic inhibitory effect on repaglinide. Therefore, patients taking repaglinide and gemfibrozil should not take itraconazole.Repaglinide: In vivo data from a study that evaluated the co-administration of gemfibrozil with repaglinide in healthy subjects resulted in a significant increase in repaglinide blood levels.
