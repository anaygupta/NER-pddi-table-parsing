                        Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 and inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect concentrations of the primary metabolite of TORISEL. If alternatives cannot be used, dose modifications of TORISEL are recommended. (7.1, 7.2)
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Agents Inducing CYP3A Metabolism
                     
                        Co-administration of TORISEL with rifampin, a potent CYP3A4/5 inducer, had no significant effect on temsirolimus Cmax (maximum concentration) and AUC (area under the concentration versus the time curve) after intravenous administration, but decreased sirolimus Cmax by 65% and AUC by 56% compared to TORISEL treatment alone. If alternative treatment cannot be administered, a dose adjustment should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Agents Inhibiting CYP3A Metabolism
                     
                        Co-administration of TORISEL with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, had no significant effect on temsirolimus Cmax or AUC; however, sirolimus AUC increased 3.1-fold, and Cmax increased 2.2-fold compared to TORISEL alone. If alternative treatment cannot be administered, a dose adjustment should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Interactions with Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6
                     
                        The concentration of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, was unaffected when 25 mg of TORISEL was co-administered. No clinically significant effect is anticipated when temsirolimus is co-administered with agents that are metabolized by CYP2D6 or CYP3A4.
