Drug Interactions
Anticoagulants and agents that alter platelet function (such as aspirin, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, dipyridamole, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors) may increase the risk of serious bleeding.Administration of Kinlytic™ prior to, during, or after thrombolytic agents may increase the risk of serious bleeding.Because concomitant use of Kinlytic™ with agents that alter coagulation, inhibit platelet function, or are thrombolytic may further increase the potential for bleeding complications, careful monitoring for bleeding is recommended.The interaction of Kinlytic™ with other drugs has not been studied and is not known.
