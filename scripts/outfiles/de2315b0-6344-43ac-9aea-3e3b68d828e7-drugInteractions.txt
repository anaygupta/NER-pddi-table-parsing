                     7.1 Mycophenolic Acid 
                     
                        When ENVARSUS XR is prescribed with a given dose of mycophenolic acid (MPA) product, exposure to MPA is higher with ENVARSUS XR coadministration than with cyclosporine coadministration because cyclosporine interrupts the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA while tacrolimus does not. Monitor for MPA associated adverse reactions and reduce the dose of concomitantly administered mycophenolic acid products as needed.
