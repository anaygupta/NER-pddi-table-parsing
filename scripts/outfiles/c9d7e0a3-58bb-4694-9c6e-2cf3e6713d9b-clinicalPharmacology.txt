                  The mechanism of trazodone HClâ€™s antidepressant action in man is not fully understood.  In animals, trazodone HCl selectively inhibits its serotonin uptake by brain synaptosomes and potentiates the behavioral changes induced by the serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan.  Cardiac conduction effects of trazodone HCl in the anesthetized dog are qualitatively dissimilar and quantitatively less pronounced than those seen with tricyclic antidepressants.  Trazodone HCl is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and, unlike amphetamine type drugs, does not stimulate the central nervous system.
