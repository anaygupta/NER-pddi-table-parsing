                              •Opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants: Avoid using with Hydrocodone Bitartrate, Chlorpheniramine Maleate and Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride; May cause additive CNS depression. (7.1)
                           
                              •MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants: Do not use. May increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone; may cause increase in blood pressure or hypertensive crisis may occur. (7.2)
                           
                              •Anticholinergic drugs: Use with caution. Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade (e.g., xerostomia, blurred vision, or constipation) may occur. (7.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Opioids, Antihistamines, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety Agents, or Other CNS Depressants (Including Alcohol)
                     
                        The use of opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants concomitantly with Hydrocodone Bitartrate, Chlorpheniramine Maleate and Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Oral Solution may cause an additive CNS depressant effect and should be avoided.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 MAOIs and Tricyclic Antidepressants
                     
                        Do not prescribe Hydrocodone Bitartrate, Chlorpheniramine Maleate and Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Oral Solution if the patient is taking a prescription MAOI (i.e., certain drugs used for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson's disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping a MAOI drug. The use of MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone. An increase in blood pressure or hypertensive crisis may also occur when pseudoephedrine containing preparations are used with MAOIs [see 
                           WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Anticholinergic Drugs
                     
                        Hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine should be administered cautiously to persons receiving other anticholinergic drugs in order to avoid paralytic ileus and excessive anticholinergic effects.
                        Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade (e.g., xerostomia, blurred vision, or constipation) may occur when anticholinergic drugs are administered with chlorpheniramine [see 
                           WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)]
