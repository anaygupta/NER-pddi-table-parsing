                  ENLON is an anticholinesterase drug. Its pharmacologic action is due primarily to the inhibition or inactivation of acetylcholinesterase at sites of cholinergic transmission. Its effect is manifest within 30 to 60 seconds after injection and lasts an average of 10 minutes.

                        The pharmacology of edrophonium chloride was studied in 14 infants (between 3 weeks and 11 months old) and 12 children (between 1 year and 6 years old) during a steady-state infusion of d-tubocurarine during N2O-halothane anesthesia and controlled ventilation for elective surgery.1 The ED50 dose (dose producing 50% antagonism of 90% neuromuscular depression) for edrophonium chloride was 145 mcg/kg in infants and 233 mcg/kg in children not significantly different from that observed in adult patients; however, there was greater variability among infants and children than adults. Time to peak antagonism and duration of antagonism were similar between the two pediatric age groups and adult patients. Edrophonium chloride pharmacokinetics were studied in four infants (3 months through 7 months of age) and four children (1 through 4 years of age). Total clearance was 17.8 mL/kg•min in infants and 14.2 mL/kg•min in children. Total clearance was significantly greater in infants than in adults (8.3 + 2.9 mL/kg•min) p<0.05. Elimination half-life was 73 ± 30 minutes in infants and 99 ± 31 minutes in children compared with 126 ± 59 minutes in adult patients. Volume of distribution in infants and children was 1.18 ± 0.20 L/kg and 1.22 ± 0.74 L/kg, respectively, compared with 0.90 ± 0.13 L/kg in adults.
