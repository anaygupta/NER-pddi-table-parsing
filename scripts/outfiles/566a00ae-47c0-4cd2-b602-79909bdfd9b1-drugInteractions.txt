                        In a Phase 1 trial using escalating doses of paclitaxel (110– 200 mg/m2) and cisplatin (50 or 75 mg/m2) given as sequential infusions, myelosuppression was more profound when paclitaxel was given after cisplatin than with  the alternate sequence (ie, paclitaxel before cisplatin). Pharmacokinetic data from these patients demonstrated a decrease in paclitaxel clearance of approximately 33% when paclitaxel was administered following cisplatin.
                        The metabolism of paclitaxel injection is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Caution should be exercised when paclitaxel injection is concomitantly administered with known substrates (eg, midazolam, buspirone, felodipine, lovastatin, eletriptan, sildenafil, simvastatin, and triazolam), inhibitors (eg, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin), and inducers (eg, rifampin and carbamazepine) of CYP3A4. 
                              See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.)
                        
                        Caution should also be exercised when paclitaxel injection is concomitantly administered with known substrates (eg, repaglinide and rosiglitazone), inhibitors (eg, gemfibrozil), and inducers (eg, rifampin) of CYP2C8. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.)
                        
                        Potential interactions between paclitaxel injection, a substrate of CYP3A4, and protease inhibitors (ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir), which are substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4, have not been evaluated in clinical trials.
                        Reports in the literature suggest that plasma levels of doxorubicin (and its active  metabolite doxorubicinol) may be increased when paclitaxel and doxorubicin are used in combination.
