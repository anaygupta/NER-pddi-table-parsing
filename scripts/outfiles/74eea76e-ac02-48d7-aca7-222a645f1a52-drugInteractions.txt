                     In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin.
                  
 

                  
                  
                  Coadministration of amlodipine with cimetidine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine. 
                  
 

                  
                  
                  Coadministration of 240 mL of grapefruit juice with a single oral dose of amlodipine 10 mg in 20 healthy volunteers had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine. 
                  
 

                  
                  
                  Coadministration of a magnesium and aluminum hydroxide antacid with a single dose of amlodipine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.
                  
 

                  
                  
                  A single 100 mg dose of sildenafil in subjects with essential hypertension had no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine. When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect.
                  
 

                  
                  
                  Coadministration of multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine with 80 mg of atorvastatin resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin.
                  
 

                  
                  
                  Coadministration of amlodipine with digoxin did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance in normal volunteers.
                  
 

                  
                  
                  Single and multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of ethanol.
                  
 

                  
                  
                  Coadministration of amlodipine with warfarin did not change the warfarin prothrombin response time.
                  
 

                  
                  
                  None known.
