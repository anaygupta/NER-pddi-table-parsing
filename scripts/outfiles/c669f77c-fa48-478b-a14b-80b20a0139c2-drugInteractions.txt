                  The interaction of Activase with other cardioactive or cerebroactive drugs has not been studied.  Anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after Activase therapy.
                  In the post-marketing setting, there have been reports of orolingual angioedema in patients (primarily patients with AIS) receiving concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
                  
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Anticoagulants and drugs that inhibit platelet function increase the risk of bleeding when administered with Activase therapy. (7)
                           Concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may increase the risk of orolingual angioedema. (7)
