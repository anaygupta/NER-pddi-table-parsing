                        Results from a pharmacokinetic sub-study demonstrated no pharmacokinetic interaction between peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin.

                           NRTIs
                        
                        In Study NR15961 among the CHC/HIV coinfected cirrhotic patients receiving NRTIs cases of hepatic decompensation (some fatal) were observed (see 
                              WARNINGS: Hepatic Failure).
                        
                        Patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin tablets and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities. Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management. In addition, dose reduction or discontinuation of peginterferon alfa-2a, ribavirin tablets or both should also be considered if worsening toxicities are observed (see 
                              WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and 
                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dose Modifications).
                        
                        
                           Didanosine
                        
                        Co-administration of ribavirin tablets and didanosine is not recommended. Reports of fatal hepatic failure, as well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis have been reported in clinical trials (see 
                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions).
                        
                        
                           Zidovudine
                        
                        In Study NR15961, patients who were administered zidovudine in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin tablets developed severe neutropenia (ANC <500) and severe anemia (hemoglobin <8 g/dL) more frequently than similar patients not receiving zidovudine (neutropenia 15% vs. 9%) (anemia 5% vs. 1%).
                        
                           Lamivudine, Stavudine, and Zidovudine
                        
                        
                           In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogs such as lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. No evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction was seen when ribavirin was co-administered with lamivudine, stavudine, and/or zidovudine in HIV/HCV coinfected patients (see 
                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions).
