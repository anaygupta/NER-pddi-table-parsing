When given concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: 
 

                        Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics - potentiation of ortho­static hypotension may occur. 
 

                        Antidiabetic drugs - (oral agents and insulin) dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.               
                        
 

                        Other antihypertensive drugs  -  ­additive effect or potentiation. 
 

                        Cholestyramine and colestipol resins - Cholestyramine and colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and re­duce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.
 

                        Corticosteroid, ACTH - intensi­fied electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.
 

                        Pressor amines (e.g., norepinephrine) - possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. 
 

                        Skeletal muscle relaxants, non-depolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) - possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. 
 

                        Lithium - generally should not be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clear­ance of lithium and greatly increase the risk of lithium tox­icity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with hydrochloro­thiazide.
 

                        Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. When hydrochloro­thiazide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patients should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
