                     7.1 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular
Atrial Fibrillation
                     
                        The concomitant use of PRADAXA with P-gp inducers
(e.g., rifampin) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally
be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent
factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran [see
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment
is expected to produce increased exposure of dabigatran compared to
that seen with either factor alone.
                        In patients with moderate renal impairment
(CrCl 30-50 mL/min), reduce the dose of PRADAXA to 75 mg twice daily
when administered concomitantly with the P-gp inhibitors dronedarone
or systemic ketoconazole. The use of the P-gp inhibitors verapamil,
amiodarone, quinidine, clarithromycin, and ticagrelor does not require
a dose adjustment of PRADAXA.  These results should not be extrapolated
to other P-gp inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        The concomitant use of PRADAXA and P-gp inhibitors
in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min) should
be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism
                     
                        Avoid use of PRADAXA and P-gp inhibitors in
patients with CrCl <50 mL/min [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
