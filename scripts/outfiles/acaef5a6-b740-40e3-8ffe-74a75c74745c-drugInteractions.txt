                           Leucovorin is a substrate for VORAXAZE. Do not administer leucovorin within 2 hours before or after a dose of VORAXAZE.  (7.1)
                           Other potential exogenous substrates of VORAXAZE include reduced folates and folate antimetabolites.  (7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1     Use of VORAXAZE with Leucovorin
                     
                        Leucovorin is a substrate for VORAXAZE.  Do not administer leucovorin within 2 hours before or after a dose of VORAXAZE.  No dose adjustment is recommended for the continuing leucovorin regimen because the leucovorin dose is based on the patient’s pre-VORAXAZE methotrexate concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                        Other potential exogenous substrates of VORAXAZE may include reduced folates and folate antimetabolites.
