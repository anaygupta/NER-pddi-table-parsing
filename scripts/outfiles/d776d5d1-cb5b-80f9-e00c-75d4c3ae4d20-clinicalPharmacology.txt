                  Verapamil hydrochloride and trandolapril have been used individually and in combination for the treatment of hypertension.  For the four dosing strengths, the antihypertensive effect of the combination is approximately additive to the individual components. 
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Verapamil Component
                     
                        Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that exerts its pharmacologic effects by modulating the influx of ionic calcium across the cell membrane of the arterial smooth muscle as well as in conductile and contractile myocardial cells.  Verapamil exerts antihypertensive effects by decreasing systemic vascular resistance, usually without orthostatic decreases in blood pressure or reflex tachycardia.  During isometric or dynamic exercise, verapamil does not alter systolic cardiac function in patients with normal ventricular function.  Verapamil does not alter total serum calcium levels.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Trandolapril Component
                     
                        Trandolapril is de-esterified to its diacid metabolite, trandolaprilat.  Both inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals.  Trandolaprilat is about 8 times more potent than trandolapril.  ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II.  Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.
                        Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion.  The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium.  In controlled clinical trials, treatment with trandolapril/verapamil hydrochloride ER tablets resulted in mean increases in potassium of 0.1 mEq/L (see 
                              PRECAUTIONS
                           ).  Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity (PRA).
                        ACE is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin.  Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effect of trandolapril/verapamil hydrochloride ER tablets remains to be elucidated.
                        While the mechanism through which trandolapril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, trandolapril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low renin hypertension.  Trandolapril is an effective antihypertensive in all races studied.  Both black patients (usually a predominantly low renin group) and non-black patients respond to 2 to 4 mg of trandolapril. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
                     
                        
                           Trandolapril/verapamil Hydrochloride ER Tablets
                        
                        Following a single oral dose of trandolapril/verapamil hydrochloride ER tablets in healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are reached within 0.5-2 hours for trandolapril and within 4-15 hours for verapamil.  Peak plasma concentrations of the active desmethyl metabolite of verapamil, norverapamil, are reached within 5-15 hours.  Cleavage of the ester group converts trandolapril to its active diacid metabolite, trandolaprilat, which reaches peak plasma concentrations within 2-12 hours.  The pharmacokinetics of trandolapril and trandolaprilat are not altered when trandolapril is administered in combination with verapamil, compared to monotherapy.
                        The AUC and Cmax for both verapamil and norverapamil are increased when 240 mg of controlled release verapamil is administered concomitantly with 4 mg trandolapril.  The increase in Cmax is 54 and 30% and the AUC is increased by 65 and 32% for verapamil and norverapamil, respectively.  Administration of trandolapril/verapamil hydrochloride ER 4/240 tablets (4 mg trandolapril and 240 mg verapamil hydrochloride ER) with a high-fat meal does not alter the bioavailability of trandolapril whereas verapamil peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) decrease 37% and 28%, respectively.  Food thus decreases verapamil bioavailability and the time to peak plasma concentration for both verapamil and norverapamil are delayed by approximately 7 hours.  Both optical isomers of verapamil are similarly affected.
                         The elimination half life of trandolapril is about 6 hours.  At steady state, the effective half-life of trandolaprilat is 22.5 hours.  Like all ACE inhibitors, trandolaprilat also has a prolonged terminal elimination phase, involving a small fraction of administered drug, probably representing binding to plasma and tissue ACE.
                        The terminal half-life of verapamil is 6-11 hours.  Steady-state plasma concentrations of the two components are achieved after about a week of once-daily dosing of trandolapril/verapamil hydrochloride ER tablets.  At steady-state, plasma concentrations of verapamil and trandolaprilat are up to two-fold higher than those observed after a single oral trandolapril/verapamil hydrochloride ER tablets dose. 
                        The pharmacokinetics of verapamil and trandolaprilat are significantly different in the elderly (≥65 years) than in younger subjects.  The bioavailability of verapamil and norverapamil are increased by 87% and 77%, respectively, and that of trandolapril by approximately 35% in the elderly.  AUCs are approximately 80% and 35% higher, respectively. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Verapamil Component
                     
                        With the immediate release formulation, more than 90% of the orally administered dose is absorbed with peak plasma concentrations of verapamil observed 1 to 2 hours after dosing.  A delayed rate but similar extent of absorption is observed for the sustained release formulation when compared to the immediate release formulation.  Because of the rapid biotransformation of verapamil during its first pass through the portal circulation, absolute bioavailability ranges from 20% to 35%.  A nonlinear correlation exists between verapamil dose and plasma concentrations.
                        In early dose titration with verapamil, a relationship exists between plasma concentrations of verapamil and prolongation of the PR interval.  However, during chronic administration, this relationship may disappear.  No relationship has been established between the plasma concentration of verapamil and reduction in blood pressure. 
                        In healthy subjects, orally administered verapamil undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver.  Twelve metabolites have been identified in plasma; all except norverapamil are present in trace amounts only.  Approximately 70% of an administered dose is excreted as metabolites in the urine and 16% or more in the feces within 5 days.  Urinary excretion of unchanged drug is about 3% to 4% of the dose.  Verapamil is approximately 90% bound to plasma proteins. 
                        In patients with hepatic insufficiency, verapamil clearance is decreased about 30% and the elimination half-life is prolonged up to 14 to 16 hours (see 
                              PRECAUTIONS
                           ).  In patients with liver dysfunction, a dosage adjustment may be required.  In the elderly (≥65 years), verapamil clearance is reduced resulting in increases in elimination half-life.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Trandolapril Component
                     
                        Following oral administration of trandolapril, the absolute bioavailability of trandolapril is approximately 10% as trandolapril and 70% as trandolaprilat.  Plasma concentrations of trandolaprilat but not trandolapril increase in proportion with dose.  Plasma concentrations of trandolaprilat decline in a triphasic manner.  The more prolonged terminal elimination phase probably represents a small fraction of dose saturably bound to ACE. 
                        After an oral radiolabeled dose of trandolapril, excretion of trandolapril and metabolites account for 33% of the dose in the urine and about 66% in the feces.  Less than 1% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug.  Serum protein binding of trandolapril is about 80%, and is independent of concentration.  Binding of trandolaprilat is concentration-dependent, varying from 65% at 1000 ng/mL to 94% at 0.1 ng/mL, indicating saturation of binding with increasing concentration. 
                        Compared to normal subjects, the plasma concentrations of trandolapril and trandolaprilat are approximately 2-fold greater and renal clearance is reduced by about 85% in patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min and in patients on hemodialysis.  Dosage adjustment is recommended in renally impaired patients  (see 
                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                           ).
                        Following oral administration in patients with mild to moderate alcoholic cirrhosis, plasma concentrations of trandolapril and trandolaprilat were, respectively, 9-fold and 2-fold greater than in normal subjects, but inhibition of ACE activity was not affected.  Lower doses should be considered in patients with hepatic insufficiency  (see 
                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                           ).

                        Verapamil does not interfere with ACE inhibition by trandolapril.  Trandolapril does not alter the effect of verapamil on intra-cardiac conduction.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Verapamil Component
                     
                        Verapamil dilates the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in normal and ischemic regions, and is a potent inhibitor of coronary artery spasm.  This property increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients with coronary artery spasm, and is responsible for the effectiveness of verapamil in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) as well as unstable angina at rest.
                        Verapamil regularly reduces the total systemic resistance (afterload) by dilating peripheral arterioles.  By decreasing the influx of calcium, verapamil prolongs the effective refractory period within the AV node and slows AV conduction in a rate-related manner.
                        Normal sinus rhythm is usually not affected, but in patients with sick sinus syndrome, verapamil may interfere with sinus node impulse generation and may induce sinus arrest or sinoatrial block.  Atrioventricular block can occur in patients without preexisting conduction defects (see 
                              WARNINGS
                           ).
                        Verapamil does not alter the normal atrial action potential or intraventricular conduction time, but depresses amplitude, velocity of depolarization and conduction in depressed atrial fibers.  Verapamil may shorten the antegrade effective refractory period of accessory bypass tracts.  Acceleration of ventricular rate and/or ventricular fibrillation has been reported in patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and a coexisting accessory AV pathway following administration of verapamil (see 
                              WARNINGS
                           ).
                        Hemodynamics and Myocardial Metabolism:  Verapamil reduces afterload and myocardial contractility.  Improved left ventricular diastolic function in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS) and those with coronary heart disease has also been observed with verapamil therapy.  In most patients, including those with organic cardiac disease, the negative inotropic action of verapamil is countered by a reduction of afterload and cardiac index is usually not reduced.  However, in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (e.g., pulmonary wedge pressure about 20 mmHg or ejection fraction less than 30%), or in patients taking beta-adrenergic blocking agents or other cardio-depressant drugs, deterioration of ventricular function may occur (see 
                              PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions
                           ). 
                        Pulmonary Function:  Verapamil does not induce bronchoconstriction and hence, does not impair ventilatory function.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Trandolapril Component
                     
                        After a single 2 mg dose of trandolapril, inhibition of ACE activity reaches a maximum (70-85%) at 4 hours with about 10% decline at 24 hours.  Eight days after dosing, ACE inhibition is still 40%. 
                        Four placebo-controlled dose response studies were conducted using once daily oral dosing of trandolapril in doses from 0.25 to 16 mg per day in 827 black and non-black patients with mild to moderate hypertension.  The minimal effective once daily dose was 1.0 mg in non-black patients and 2.0 mg in black patients.  Further decreases in trough supine diastolic blood pressure were obtained in non-black patients with higher doses, and no further response was seen with doses above 4 mg (up to 16 mg).  The antihypertensive effect diminished somewhat at the end of the dosing interval.
                        During chronic therapy, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is achieved within one week.  Following 6 weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 2 to 4 mg lowered supine or standing systolic/diastolic blood pressure 24 hours after dosing by an average 7-10/4-5 mmHg below placebo responses in non-black patients.  Once daily doses of 2 to 4 mg lowered blood pressures 4-6/3-4 mmHg below placebo responses in black patients.
