                     7.1  Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)
                     
                        Monitor for a need to adjust concomitant mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosage when patient’s therapy is switched between cyclosporine and NULOJIX, as cyclosporine decreases mycophenolic acid (MPA) exposure by preventing enterohepatic recirculation of MPA while NULOJIX does not [see

                              •A higher MMF dosage may be needed after switching from NULOJIX to cyclosporine, since this may result in lower MPA concentrations and increase the risk of graft rejection.
                           
                              •A lower MMF dosage may be needed after switching from cyclosporine to NULOJIX, since this may result in higher MPA concentrations and increase the risk for adverse reactions related to MPA (review the Full Prescribing Information for MMF).
