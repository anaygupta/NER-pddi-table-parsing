                        The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or phenothiazines may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension. Concurrent use of these agents should generally be avoided. In situations when concurrent therapy is necessary, careful patient monitoring is essential.
                        Concurrent administration of vasopressor drugs (for the treatment of hypotension related to spinal blocks) and ergot-type oxytocic drugs may cause severe, persistent hypertension or cerebrovascular accidents.
