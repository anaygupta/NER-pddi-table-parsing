                     12.1  Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Fospropofol disodium is a prodrug of propofol.  Following intravenous injection, fospropofol is metabolized by alkaline phosphatases.  For every millimole of fospropofol disodium administered, one millimole of propofol is produced (1.86 mg of fospropofol disodium is the molar equivalent of 1 mg propofol). 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2  Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        The pharmacology of fospropofol, once metabolized to propofol, is comparable to that of propofol lipid emulsion; however, the liberation of propofol from fospropofol results in differences in the timing of the pharmacodynamic effects. To characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile of propofol derived from LUSEDRA, 12 healthy subjects were administered a 10-mg/kg intravenous bolus dose of LUSEDRA, and the sedative effect was measured as a decrease in Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score (Table 5).2   The PK and PD results are shown in Figure 2.  Peak plasma levels of propofol (2.2 ± 0.4 μg/mL) released from fospropofol were noted by 8 minutes (range 4 - 13 minutes) and minimum mean MOAA/S score of 1.2 (range 0 - 3) was noted in 7 minutes (range 1 - 15 minutes).  Subjects completely recovered from sedative effects between 21 to 45 minutes after LUSEDRA administration.

                        LUSEDRA was evaluated in randomized, blinded, dose-controlled studies for sedation in patients undergoing colonoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].  Figure 3 shows MOAA/S scores over time in each of the studies for those patients who received the standard and modified dosing regimens.  In the study of patients undergoing colonoscopy, patients who received the standard and modified dosing regimens had a median [range] time to sedation (time from first dose of sedative to the first of 2 consecutive MOAA/S scores of ≤ 4) of 8.0 [2, 28] minutes and a median time to Fully Alert (3 consecutive responses to their name spoken in a normal tone, measured every 2 minutes beginning at or after the end of the procedure) of  5.0 [0, 47] minutes.  In the study of patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy, patients who received the standard and modified LUSEDRA dosing regimens had a median time to sedation of 4 [2, 22] minutes and a median time to Fully Alert of 5.5 [0, 61] minutes.

                        Within the recommended dose range, there were no differences in matched QTc interval changes between LUSEDRA and placebo.  The effect of LUSEDRA on the QTcF interval was measured in a crossover study in which healthy subjects (n=68) received the following treatments: 6-mg/kg intravenous LUSEDRA; 18-mg/kg intravenous LUSEDRA; moxifloxacin 400 mg orally (positive control); and normal saline IV. After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 2 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 6 ms) for the 6-mg/kg dose and 8 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 12 ms) for the 18-mg/kg dose. Used as a positive control, moxifloxacin had a maximum mean change in QTcF of 12 ms (1-sided 95% Lower CI: 6 ms).

                        PK parameters were evaluated in a crossover study of 68 healthy subjects, 18 to 45 years of age, who received 6- and 18-mg/kg intravenous bolus doses of LUSEDRA.  PK parameters are shown in Table 6.  The Cmax and AUC0-∞ values of fospropofol were dose proportional.  The intersubject variability in Cmax and AUC0-∞ was low.  Propofol was rapidly liberated reaching plasma Cmax at a median Tmax of 12 minutes for LUSEDRA 6 mg/kg and 8 minutes for LUSEDRA 18 mg/kg.  Concentration-time profiles showed a biexponential decline.  The increase in Cmax and AUC0-∞ of propofol was dose proportional.  
                        


                        



                           Distribution
                        
                        Fospropofol has a low volume of distribution of 0.33±0.069 L/kg, and the liberated propofol has a large volume of distribution (5.8 L/kg).  
                        Both fospropofol and its active metabolite propofol are highly protein bound (approximately 98%), primarily to albumin.  Fospropofol does not affect the binding of propofol to albumin.  
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        Fospropofol is completely metabolized by alkaline phosphatases to propofol, formaldehyde, and phosphate.  Formaldehyde and phosphate plasma concentrations are comparable to endogenous levels when fospropofol disodium is administered as recommended.  Formaldehyde is further metabolized to formate by several enzyme systems, including formaldehyde dehydrogenase, present in various tissues.  Propofol liberated from fospropofol is further metabolized to major metabolites propofol glucuronide (34.8%), quinol-4-sulfate (4.6%), quinol-1-glucuronide (11.1%), and quinol-4-glucuronide (5.1%). Oxidation to CO2 is the primary means of eliminating excess formate.  
                        Fospropofol is not a substrate of CYP450 enzymes.
                        
                           Elimination
                        
                        After a single 400 mg intravenous dose of [14C]-fospropofol disodium in humans, approximately 71% of radioactivity was recovered in the urine within 192 hours.  Total body clearance (CLp) of fospropofol was 0.280±0.053 L/h/kg, and renal elimination of fospropofol was insignificant (<0.02% of dose).  The terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2) of fospropofol was 0.81±0.08 and 0.88±0.08 hours in healthy subjects and patients, respectively.  In healthy subjects, the apparent total body clearance of liberated propofol (CLp/F) was 1.95±0.345 L/h/kg and t1/2 was 2.06±0.77 hours.  In patients, the CLp of fospropofol was 0.31±0.14 L/h/kg and CLp/F for propofol was 2.74±0.80 L/h/kg and is similar to that observed in healthy subjects.
                        
                           Special Populations
                        
                        Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no influence of race, gender, age, renal impairment or alkaline phosphatase concentrations on the pharmacokinetics of fospropofol.  Pharmacokinetics of propofol derived from fospropofol was not influenced by race, gender, or renal impairment.
                        LUSEDRA has not been adequately studied in patients with hepatic impairment.  Caution should be exercised when using fospropofol disodium in patients with hepatic impairment.
                        
                           Drug Interactions
                        
                        There was no effect of analgesic premedication [fentanyl (1 mcg/kg); meperidine (0.75 mg/kg); midazolam (0.01 mg/kg); morphine (0.1 mg/kg)] on plasma pharmacokinetics of fospropofol.
                        In an in vitro protein-binding study, there was no significant interaction between fospropofol and propofol at concentrations up to 200 mcg/mL and 5 mcg/mL, respectively.  The interaction of fospropofol with other highly protein-bound drugs given concomitantly has not been studied.
                        Potential of fospropofol or its major metabolite, propofol, to inhibit or induce major cytochrome P450 enzymes is not known.
