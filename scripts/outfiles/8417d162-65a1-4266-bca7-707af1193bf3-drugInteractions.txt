                     7.1 Oral Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors
                     
                        There is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution.  The concomitant administration of Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 High-Dose Salicylate Therapy
                     
                        Although acid-base and electrolyte disturbances were not reported in the clinical trials with dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, these disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and have, in some instances, resulted in drug interactions (e.g., toxicity associated with high-dose salicylate therapy). Therefore, the potential for such drug interactions should be considered in patients receiving Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution.
