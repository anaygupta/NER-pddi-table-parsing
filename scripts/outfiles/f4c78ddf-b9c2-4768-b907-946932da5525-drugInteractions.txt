                  In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin.

                  

                  Effect of Other Agents on Amlodipine Besylate Tablets

                  CIMETIDINE: Coadministration of amlodipine besylate tablets with cimetidine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.
GRAPEFRUIT JUICE: Coadministration of 240 mL of grapefruit juice with a single oral dose of amlodipine 10 mg in 20 healthy volunteers had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.
MAALOX (antacid): Coadministration of the antacid Maalox with a single dose of amlodipine besylate tablets had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.
SILDENAFIL: A single 100 mg dose of sildenafil in subjects with essential hypertension had no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine. When amlodipine besylate tablets and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect.

                  

                  Effect of Amlodipine Besylate Tablets on Other Agents

                  ATORVASTATIN: Coadministration of multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine besylate tablets with 80 mg of atorvastatin resulted in no significant change in the steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin.
DIGOXIN: Coadministration of amlodipine besylate tablets with digoxin did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance in normal volunteers.
ETHANOL (alcohol): Single and multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine besylate tablets had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of ethanol.
WARFARIN: Coadministration of amlodipine besylate tablets with warfarin did not change the warfarin prothrombin response time.
In clinical trials, amlodipine besylate tablets have been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and oral hypoglycemic drugs.
