                           Some drugs increase risks due to fluid and electrolyte      changes (7.1)
                           Oral medication taken within 1 hour of start of each dose      may not be absorbed properly (7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.1 Drugs that May Lead to Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities
                     
                        Use caution when prescribing polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution for patients who are using medications that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Consider additional patient evaluations as appropriate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4)] in patients taking these concomitant medications.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.2 Potential for Altered Drug Absorption
                     
                        Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of administration of polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract and the medication may not be absorbed properly.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.3 Stimulant Laxatives
                     
                        Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid use of stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate) while taking polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution.
