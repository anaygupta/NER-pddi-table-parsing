                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Calcipotriene is a synthetic vitamin D3 analog that has a similar receptor binding affinity as natural vitamin D3. However, the exact mechanism of action contributing to the clinical efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis is unknown.

                        The pharmacodynamics of SORILUX Foam are unknown.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The systemic absorption of calcipotriene in subjects with psoriasis of the body was evaluated at steady state following application of either SORILUX Foam or calcipotriene ointment to a body surface area of 5% to 10%. In the SORILUX Foam treatment group, 15 out of 16 subjects had calcipotriene plasma concentrations below the limit of quantitation (10 pg/mL), while in the calcipotriene ointment treated group, 5 out of 16 subjects had measurable calcipotriene plasma concentrations at various time points. All measurable plasma calcipotriene concentrations were below 25 pg/mL.
                        The systemic disposition of calcipotriene is expected to be similar to that of the naturally occurring vitamin D. Absorbed calcipotriene is known to be converted to inactive metabolites within 24 hours of application and the metabolism occurs via a similar pathway to the natural hormone.
