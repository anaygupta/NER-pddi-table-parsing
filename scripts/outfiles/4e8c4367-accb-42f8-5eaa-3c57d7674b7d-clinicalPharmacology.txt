                  Irrigation of the urinary bladder with acetic acid solution
in a concentration of 0.25% has been shown to exert an antimicrobial action
against a variety of microorganisms (especially ammonia-forming bacteria)
that frequently gain access to the urinary bladder in patients who require
prolonged indwelling urethral catheterization. Its antimicrobial action is
dependent on administration via the indwelling catheter at a sufficient rate
(continuous or intermittent) to maintain an effluent pH of at least 5.0. Maintenance
of low pH of bladder urine also helps reduce formation of calcium encrustations
in the indwelling catheter.
