                  Ciclopirox is a broad-spectrum, antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, and Malassezia
                      furfur. Ciclopirox exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against isolates of Trichophyton

                  Pharmacokinetic studies in men with radiolabeled ciclopirox solution in polyethylene glycol 400, showed an average of 1.3% absorption of the dose when it was applied topically to 750 cm2 on the back followed by occlusion for 6 hours. The biological half-life was 1.7 hours and excretion occurred via the kidney. Two days after application only 0.01% of the dose applied could be found in the urine. Fecal excretion was negligible.
                  Autoradiographic studies with human cadaver skin showed that ciclopirox penetrates into the hair and through the epidermis and hair follicles into the sebaceous glands and dermis, while a portion of the drug remains in the stratum corneum.
                  
                     In vitro penetration studies in frozen or fresh excised human cadaver and pig skin indicated that the penetration of ciclopirox olamine topical suspension, 0.77% is equivalent to that of ciclopirox (ciclopirox olamine) cream 0.77%. Therapeutic equivalence of cream and suspension formulations was also indicated by studies of experimentally induced guinea pig and human trichophytosis.
