7.1 Probenecid
Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use of MOXATAG and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin.  The clinical relevance of this finding has not been evaluated.







7.2 Other Antibiotics
Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstrated in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.







7.3 Oral Contraceptives
As with other antibiotics, amoxicillin may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and potentially resulting in reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.
