                              INVOKAMET
                              INVOKAMET (canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride) combines two oral antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Canagliflozin
                              Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Canagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, canagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose (RTG), and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion (UGE).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Metformin
                              Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects except in special circumstances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.

                              Canagliflozin
                              Following single and multiple oral doses of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes, dose-dependent decreases in RTG and increases in urinary glucose excretion were observed. From a starting RTG value of approximately 240 mg/dL, canagliflozin at 100 mg and 300 mg once daily suppressed RTG throughout the 24-hour period. Maximal suppression of mean RTG over the 24-hour period was seen with the 300 mg daily dose to approximately 70 to 90 mg/dL in patients with type 2 diabetes in Phase 1 studies. The reductions in RTG led to increases in mean UGE of approximately 100 g/day in subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with either 100 mg or 300 mg of canagliflozin. The 24-h mean RTG at steady state was similar following once daily and twice daily dosing regimens at the same total daily dose of 100 mg or 300 mg. In patients with type 2 diabetes given 100 to 300 mg once daily over a 16-day dosing period, reductions in RTG and increases in urinary glucose excretion were observed over the dosing period. In this study, plasma glucose declined in a dose-dependent fashion within the first day of dosing.

                              In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, 4-way crossover study, 60 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of canagliflozin 300 mg, canagliflozin 1,200 mg (4 times the maximum recommended dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No meaningful changes in QTc interval were observed with either the recommended dose of 300 mg or the 1,200 mg dose.

                              INVOKAMET
                              The results of a bioequivalence study in healthy subjects demonstrated that INVOKAMET 50 mg/500 mg, 50 mg/1,000 mg, 150 mg/500 mg and 150 mg/1,000 mg combination tablets are bioequivalent to co-administration of corresponding doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride as individual tablets under fed conditions.
                              Administration of INVOKAMET 150 mg/1,000 mg fixed-dose combination with food resulted in no change in overall exposure of canagliflozin. There was no change in metformin AUC; however, the mean peak plasma concentration of metformin was decreased by 16% when administered with food. A delayed time to peak plasma concentration was observed for both components (a delay of 2 hours for canagliflozin and 1 hour for metformin) under fed conditions. These changes are not likely to be clinically meaningful.

                                    The pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin is essentially similar in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. Following single-dose oral administration of 100 mg and 300 mg of canagliflozin, peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) of canagliflozin occurs within 1 to 2 hours post-dose. Plasma Cmax and AUC of canagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner from 50 mg to 300 mg. The apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) was 10.6 hours and 13.1 hours for the 100 mg and 300 mg doses, respectively. Steady-state was reached after 4 to 5 days of once-daily dosing with canagliflozin 100 mg to 300 mg. Canagliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulated in plasma up to 36% following multiple doses of 100 mg and 300 mg. The mean systemic exposure (AUC) at steady state was similar following once daily and twice daily dosing regimens at the same total daily dose of 100 mg or 300 mg.

                                    The mean absolute oral bioavailability of canagliflozin is approximately 65%.

                                    The absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride 500 mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride 500 to 1,500 mg, and 850 to 2,550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination.

                                    The mean steady-state volume of distribution of canagliflozin following a single intravenous infusion in healthy subjects was 119 L, suggesting extensive tissue distribution. Canagliflozin is extensively bound to proteins in plasma (99%), mainly to albumin. Protein binding is independent of canagliflozin plasma concentrations. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

                                    The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride 850 mg tablets averaged 654 ± 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally less than 1 mcg/mL. During controlled clinical trials of metformin, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcg/mL, even at maximum doses.

                                       O-glucuronidation is the major metabolic elimination pathway for canagliflozin, which is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A9 and UGT2B4 to two inactive O-glucuronide metabolites. CYP3A4-mediated (oxidative) metabolism of canagliflozin is minimal (approximately 7%) in humans.

                                    Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion.

                                       Canagliflozin
                                    
                                    Following administration of a single oral [14C] canagliflozin dose to healthy subjects, 41.5%, 7.0%, and 3.2% of the administered radioactive dose was recovered in feces as canagliflozin, a hydroxylated metabolite, and an O-glucuronide metabolite, respectively. Enterohepatic circulation of canagliflozin was negligible.
                                    Approximately 33% of the administered radioactive dose was excreted in urine, mainly as O−glucuronide metabolites (30.5%). Less than 1% of the dose was excreted as unchanged canagliflozin in urine. Renal clearance of canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg doses ranged from 1.30 to 1.55 mL/min.
                                    Mean systemic clearance of canagliflozin was approximately 192 mL/min in healthy subjects following intravenous administration.

                                    Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.

                              Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin and metformin after administration of INVOKAMET were not conducted in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. Descriptions of the individual components in this patient population are described below.
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Renal Impairment
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                          
                                             Canagliflozin
                                          
                                          A single-dose, open-label study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin 200 mg in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment (classified using the MDRD-eGFR formula) compared to healthy subjects.
                                          Renal impairment did not affect the Cmax of canagliflozin. Compared to healthy subjects (N=3; eGFR greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), plasma AUC of canagliflozin was increased by approximately 15%, 29%, and 53% in subjects with mild (N=10), moderate (N=9), and severe (N=10) renal impairment, respectively, (eGFR 60 to less than 90, 30 to less than 60, and 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively) but was similar for ESRD (N=8) subjects and healthy subjects. Increases in canagliflozin AUC of this magnitude are not considered clinically relevant. The pharmacodynamic response to canagliflozin declines with increasing severity of renal impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
                                          
                                          Canagliflozin was negligibly removed by hemodialysis.

                                          In patients with decreased renal function (based on measured creatinine clearance), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

                                          Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, the geometric mean ratios for Cmax and AUC∞ of canagliflozin were 107% and 110%, respectively, in subjects with Child-Pugh class A (mild hepatic impairment) and 96% and 111%, respectively, in subjects with Child-Pugh class B (moderate hepatic impairment) following administration of a single 300 mg dose of canagliflozin.
                                          These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with Child-Pugh class C (severe) hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

                                          Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin and metformin after administration of INVOKAMET in geriatric patients have not been performed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

                                          Age had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

                                          Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased, compared with healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function.

                                    Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with INVOKAMET have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.
                                    Co-administration of multiple doses of canagliflozin (300 mg) and metformin (2,000 mg) given once daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either canagliflozin or metformin in healthy subjects.

                                          Canagliflozin did not induce CYP450 enzyme expression (3A4, 2C9, 2C19, 2B6, and 1A2) in cultured human hepatocytes. Canagliflozin did not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, or 2E1) and weakly inhibited CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 based on in vitro studies with human hepatic microsomes. Canagliflozin is a weak inhibitor of P-gp.
                                          Canagliflozin is also a substrate of drug transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and MRP2.

Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid.
