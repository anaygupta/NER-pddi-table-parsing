                     12.1     Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Secukinumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the interleukin-17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor. IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses.  Secukinumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2     Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Elevated levels of IL-17A are found in psoriatic plaques. Treatment with COSENTYX may reduce epidermal neutrophils and IL-17A levels in psoriatic plaques. Serum levels of total IL-17A (free and secukinumab-bound IL-17A) measured at Week 4 and Week 12 were increased following secukinumab treatment. These pharmacodynamic activities are based on small exploratory studies.  The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which secukinumab exerts its clinical effects is unknown.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        
                           Absorption
                        
                        Following a single subcutaneous dose of either 150 mg (one-half the recommended dose) or 300 mg in plaque psoriasis patients, secukinumab reached peak mean (± SD) serum concentrations (Cmax) of 13.7 ± 4.8 mcg/mL and 27.3 ± 9.5 mcg/mL, respectively, by approximately 6 days post dose.
                        Following multiple subcutaneous doses of secukinumab, the mean (± SD) serum trough concentrations of secukinumab ranged from 22.8 ± 10.2 mcg/mL (150 mg) to 45.4 ± 21.2 mcg/mL (300 mg) at Week 12. At the 300 mg dose at Week 4 and Week 12, the mean trough concentrations resulted from the Sensoready pen were 23% to 30% higher than those from the lyophilized powder and 23% to 26% higher than those from the prefilled syringe based on cross-study comparisons.
                        Steady-state concentrations of secukinumab were achieved by Week 24 following the every 4 week dosing regimens. The mean (± SD) steady-state trough concentrations ranged from 16.7 ± 8.2 mcg/mL (150 mg) to 34.4 ± 16.6 mcg/mL (300 mg).
                        In healthy subjects and subjects with plaque psoriasis, secukinumab bioavailability ranged from 55% to 77% following subcutaneous dose of 150 mg (one-half the recommended dose) or 300 mg.
                        
                           Distribution
                        
                        The mean volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) following a single intravenous administration ranged from 7.10 to 8.60 L in plaque psoriasis patients.  Intravenous use is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. 
                        Secukinumab concentrations in interstitial fluid in lesional and non-lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients ranged from 27% to 40% of those in serum at 1 and 2 weeks after a single subcutaneous dose of secukinumab 300 mg.
                        
                           Elimination
                        
                        The metabolic pathway of secukinumab has not been characterized. As a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody secukinumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG.
                        The mean systemic clearance (CL) ranged from 0.14 L/day to 0.22 L/day and the mean half-life ranged from 22 to 31 days in plaque psoriasis subjects following intravenous and subcutaneous administration across all psoriasis trials.  Intravenous use is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. 

                        
                           Dose Linearity
                        
                        Secukinumab exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in subjects with psoriasis over a dose range from 25 mg (approximately 0.083 times the recommended dose) to 300 mg following subcutaneous administrations.
                        
                           Weight
                        
                        Secukinumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases. 
                        
                           Specific Populations
                        
                        
                           Hepatic or Renal Impairment: 
                        
                        No formal trial of the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of secukinumab was conducted.
                        
                           Age: Geriatric Population: 
                        
                        Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the clearance of secukinumab was not significantly influenced by age in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. Subjects who are 65 years or older had apparent clearance of secukinumab similar to subjects less than 65 years old.
