                  There are many drugs which may increase or decrease phenytoin 
levels or which phenytoin may affect. Serum level determinations for phenytoin 
are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. The most 
commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below:
                  
                     Drugs which may increase phenytoin serum levels include: acute alcohol 
intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, 
dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, 
halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, 
salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, 
trazodone.
                     Drugs which may decrease phenytoin levels include: carbamazepine, chronic 
alcohol abuse, reserpine, and sucralfate. MobanÂ® brand of 
molindone hydrochloride contains calcium ions which interfere with the 
absorption of phenytoin. Ingestion times of phenytoin and antacid preparations 
containing calcium should be staggered in patients with low serum phenytoin 
levels to prevent absorption problems.
                     Drugs which may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels include: 
phenobarbital, sodium valproate, and valproic acid. Similarly, the effect of 
phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid, and sodium valproate serum levels is 
unpredictable.
                     Although not a true drug interaction, tricyclic antidepressants may 
precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and phenytoin dosage may need to be 
adjusted.
                     Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin include: corticosteroids, 
coumarin anticoagulants, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral 
contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, theophylline, vitamin 
D.
                  
                  
                  Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations 
InteractionLiterature reports suggest that patients who have received 
enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower 
than expected phenytoin plasma levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin 
not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More 
frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these 
patients.
                  
                  Drug/Laboratory Test InteractionsPhenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of T4. It may also 
produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. 
Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, and 
gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT).
                  Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure plasma 
phenytoin concentrations.
