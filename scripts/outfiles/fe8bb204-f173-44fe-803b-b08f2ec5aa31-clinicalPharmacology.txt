                        Clindamycin is an antibacterial drug [see Clinical Pharmacology, Microbiology (12.4)].

                        Following a single intravaginal application of Clindesse cream to 20 healthy women, the mean (range) AUC0-inf and Cmax estimates were 175 (38.6 to 541) ng/mL‚óèhr and 6.6 (0.8 to 39) ng/mL, respectively.  The mean Cmaxof clindamycin for Clindesse was approximately 0.3%, 0.1%, and 7.6% of that observed after the administration of a 150 mg Cleocin oral capsule (2.5 mcg/mL), a 600 mg Cleocin intravenous injection (10.9 mcg/mL), and a single dose of 100 mg of Cleocin Vaginal Cream (86.5 ng/mL), respectively.  The peak serum concentration of clindamycin was attained approximately 20 hours post dosing for Clindesse.

                           Mechanism of Action
                        
                        Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis at the level of the bacterial ribosome.  The antibiotic binds preferentially to the 50S ribosomal subunit and affects the process of peptide chain initiation.  Although clindamycin phosphate is inactive in vitro, in vivo hydrolysis converts this compound to the antibacterially active clindamycin.

                        Clindamycin is an antibacterial agent active in vitro against most strains of the following organisms that have been reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis:

                           Mobiluncusspp.
                        
                           Mycoplasma 
                           hominis
                        
                        
                           Peptostreptococcusspp.
                        Standard methodology for the susceptibility testing of the potential bacterial vaginosis pathogens has not been defined.  Culture and sensitivity testing of bacteria are not routinely performed to establish the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [see Clinical Studies (14)].
