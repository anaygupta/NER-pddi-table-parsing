                  Clinpro 5000 1.1% Sodium Fluoride Anti-Cavity Toothpaste aids in the prevention of tooth decay. Fluoride delivered from Clinpro 5000 inhibits the demineralization of sound teeth and enhances the remineralization (i.e., repair) of demineralized teeth. During tooth brushing, fluoride is taken up by teeth and dental plaque. Fluoride is taken up with calcium and phosphate by demineralized teeth resulting in an improved tooth structure than contains more fluoride and less carbonate than naturally occurring tooth structure and is more resistant to acid challenge. Additionally, calcium fluoride is formed on the crystal structure of teeth. As the pH of the mouth drops, fluoride is released from calcium fluoride and aids in the remineralization of teeth. Fluoride taken up into plaque alters the activity of cariogenic bacteria. Fluoride inhibits the process by which cariogenic bacteria metabolize carbohydrates resulting in less acid and adhesive polysaccharide production by the bacteria.
