                        In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, venlafaxine) there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions. Because Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets is a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets should not be used concomitantly with a serotoninergic agent (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).
                        Administration of guanethidine to patients receiving an MAO inhibitor can produce moderate to severe hypertension due to release of catecholamines. At least two weeks should elapse between withdrawal of the MAO inhibitor and the initiation of guanethidine. (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS)
