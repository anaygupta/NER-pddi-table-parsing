                     7.1 Erythromycin
                     
                        VELTIN Gel should not be used in combination with erythromycin-containing products due to possible antagonism to the clindamycin component. In vitrostudies have shown antagonism between these 2 antimicrobials. The clinical significance of this in vitroantagonism is not known.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents
                     
                        Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, VELTIN Gel should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.
