                        Temporary resistance to prothrombin-depressing anticoagulants may result, especially when larger doses of phytonadione are used.  If relatively large doses have been employed, it may be necessary when reinstituting anticoagulant therapy to use somewhat larger doses of the prothrombin-depressing anticoagulant, or to use one which acts on a different principle, such as heparin sodium.
