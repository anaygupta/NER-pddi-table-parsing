                  Corticosteroids suppress the inflammatory response to inciting agents of mechanical, chemical or immunological nature. No generally accepted explanation of this steroid property has been advanced. Corticosteroids cause a rise in intraocular pressure in susceptible individuals. In a small study, FLAREXÂ® (fluorometholone acetate ophthalmic suspension) demonstrated a significantly longer average time to produce a rise in intraocular pressure than did dexamethasone phosphate; however, the ultimate magnitude of the rise was equivalent for both drugs and in a small percentage of individuals a significant rise in intraocular pressure occurred within three days.
