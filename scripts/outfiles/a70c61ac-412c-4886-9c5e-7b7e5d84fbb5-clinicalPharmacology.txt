demonstrated that a single 30 mg dose of a capsule or tablet will result in 
equivalent extent of absorption. Peak plasma levels were observed to occur about 
3 hours after dosing. The mean elimination half-life for oxazepam was 
approximately 8.2 hours (range 5.7 to 10.9 hours).
                  This product has a single, major inactive metabolite in man, a glucuronide 
excreted in the urine.
                  Age (less than 80 years old) does not appear to have a clinically significant 
effect on oxazepam kinetics. A statistically significant increase in elimination 
half-life in the very elderly (greater than 80 years of age) as compared to younger 
subjects has been reported, due to a 30% increase in volume of distribution, as 
well as a 50% reduction in unbound clearance of oxazepam in the very elderly.
