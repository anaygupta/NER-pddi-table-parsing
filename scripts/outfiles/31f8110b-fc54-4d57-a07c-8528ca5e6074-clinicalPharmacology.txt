                     Mechanism of Action 
                     
                        Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent
which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering
both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of
action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents.
Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption
of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose
uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia
in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special
circumstances, see 
                              PRECAUTIONS
                           ) and does
not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains
unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response
may actually decrease.

                           Absorption and Bioavailability
                           
                              Following a single oral dose of Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, Cmax is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours.
                              At steady state, the AUC and Cmax are less than dose proportional for Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets within the range of 500 to 2000 mg administered once daily. Peak plasma levels are approximately 0.6, 1.1, 1.4, and 1.8 µg/mL for 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg once-daily doses, respectively. After repeated administration of Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, metformin did not accumulate in plasma.
                              Although the extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from the Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets increased by approximately 50% when given with food, there was no effect of food on Cmax and Tmax of metformin. Both high and low fat meals had the same effect on the pharmacokinetics of Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Metabolism and Elimination
                           
                              Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution

                           Patients with Type 2 Diabetes
                           
                              In the presence of normal renal function, there are no differences between single- or multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of metformin between patients with type 2 diabetes and normal subjects, nor is there any accumulation of metformin in either group at usual clinical doses.
                              The pharmacokinetics of Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes are comparable to those in healthy normal adults.

                              In patients with decreased renal function (based on measured creatinine clearance), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance (see

                              A 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, taken once daily with the evening meal, was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes who had failed to achieve glycemic control with diet and exercise (HbA1c 7.0%-10.0%, FPG 126-270 mg/dL). Patients entering the study had a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0% and a mean baseline FPG of 176 mg/dL. After 12 weeks treatment, mean HbA1c had increased from baseline by 0.1% and mean FPG decreased from baseline by 2 mg/dL in the placebo group, compared with a decrease in mean HbA1c of 0.6% and a decrease in mean FPG of 23 mg/dL in patients treated with Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1000 mg once daily.
                              Subsequently, the treatment dose was increased to 1500 mg once daily if HbA1c was ≥7.0% but <8.0% (patients with HbA1c ≥8.0% were discontinued from the study). At the final visit (24-week), mean HbA1c had increased 0.2% from baseline in placebo patients and decreased 0.6% with Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. A 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of Metformin
hydrochloride extended-release tablets, taken once daily with the evening meal or twice daily with meals, was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes who had failed to achieve glycemic control with diet and exercise (HbA1c 7.0%-11.0%, FPG 126-280 mg/dL). Changes in glycemic control and body weight are shown in

Compared with placebo, improvement in glycemic control was seen at all dose levels of Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and treatment was not associated with any significant change in weight

                              A
24-week, double-blind, randomized study of Metformin hydrochloride
extended-release tablets, taken once daily with the evening meal, was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes who had been treated with Metformin hydrochloride 500 mg twice daily for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry. The Metformin hydrochloride dose had not necessarily been titrated to achieve a specific level of glycemic control prior to study entry. Patients qualified for the study if HbA1c was ≤8.5% and FPG was ≤200 mg/dL. Changes in glycemic control and body weight are shown in 
                                    Table 7

After 12 weeks of treatment, there was an
increase in mean HbA1c in all groups; in the Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1000 mg group, the increase from baseline of 0.23% was statistically significant
