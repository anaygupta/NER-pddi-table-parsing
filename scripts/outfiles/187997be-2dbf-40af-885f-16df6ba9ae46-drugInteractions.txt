                           Concomitant lipid-lowering therapies: use with      fibrates or lipid-modifying doses (â‰¥1 g/day) of niacin increases      the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when      prescribing with pravastatin. (7) 
                           Cyclosporine: combination increases      exposure. Limit pravastatin to 20 mg once daily.      (2.5, 7.1) 
                           Clarithromycin: combination increases      exposure. Limit pravastatin to 40 mg once daily.      (2.6, 7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        For the concurrent therapy of either cyclosporine, fibrates, niacin (nicotinic acid), or erythromycin, the risk of myopathy increases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.1 Cyclosporine
                     
                        The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of cyclosporine. Limit pravastatin to 20 mg once daily for concomitant use with cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.2 Clarithromycin
                     
                        The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of clarithromycin. Limit pravastatin to 40 mg once daily for concomitant use with clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.3 Colchicine
                     
                        The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of colchicine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.4 Gemfibrozil
                     
                        Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of pravastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.5 Other Fibrates
                     
                        Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, pravastatin should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.6 Niacin
                     
                        The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when pravastatin is used in combination with niacin; a reduction in pravastatin dosage should be considered in this setting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
