                        Patients who are taking non-selective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing or treatment and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. Antihistamines can significantly inhibit the immediate skin test reactions. Patients should be free of such medication for at least 48 hours before testing.
