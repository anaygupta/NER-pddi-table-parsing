                        Mechanism of Action
                     
                     
                        Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and sequesters tubulin into nonproductive aggregates.  Eribulin exerts its effects via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of mitotic spindles, and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage.

                        Pharmacokinetics
                     
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics (PK) of eribulin is linear with a mean elimination half-life of approximately 40 hours, a mean volume of distribution of 43 L/m2  to 114 L/m2 and mean clearance of 1.16 L/hr/m2 to 2.42 L/hr/m2 over the dose range of  0.25 mg/m2 to 4.0 mg/m2. The human plasma protein binding of eribulin  at concentrations of 100 ng/mL to 1,000 ng/mL ranges from 49% to 65%  Eribulin exposure after multiple dosing is comparable to that following a single dose.  No accumulation of eribulin is observed with weekly administration.  
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        Unchanged eribulin was the major circulating species in plasma following administration of 14C-eribulin to patients.  Metabolite concentrations represented <0.6% of parent compound, confirming that there are no major human metabolites of eribulin.  Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) negligibly metabolizes eribulin in vitro.
                        
                           Elimination
                        
                        Eribulin is eliminated primarily in feces unchanged.  After administration of 14C-eribulin to patients, approximately 82% of the dose was eliminated in feces and 9% in urine. Unchanged eribulin accounted for approximately 88% and 91% of the dose in feces and urine, respectively. 
                        
                           Effects of Age, Gender, and Race
                        
                        Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis with data collected from 340 patients, gender, race, and age do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the PK of eribulin.

                           Effect of Other Drugs on HALAVEN
                        
                        The effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-gp inhibitor, ketoconazole, on the PK of eribulin was studied in a crossover trial of 12 patients with advanced solid tumors.  No clinically relevant PK interaction was observed when HALAVEN was administered with or without ketoconazole (the geometric mean ratio of the AUC: 0.97; 90%CI: 0.83, 1.12).   
                        The effect of a CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, on the PK of eribulin was studied in a crossover trial of 14 patients with advanced solid tumors.  No clinically relevant PK interaction was observed when HALAVEN was administered with or without rifampin (the geometric mean ratio of the AUC: 1.10; 90CI%: 0.91, 1.34).
