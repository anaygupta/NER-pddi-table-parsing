                     12.1	Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, initiation of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. IL-6 is also produced by synovial and endothelial cells leading to local production of IL-6 in joints affected by inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2	Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        In clinical studies with the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg IV doses or the 162 mg weekly and every other weekly SC doses of ACTEMRA, decreases in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) to within normal ranges were seen as early as week 2. Changes in pharmacodynamic parameters were observed (i.e., decreases in rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum amyloid A and increases in hemoglobin) with doses, however the greatest improvements were observed with 8 mg per kg ACTEMRA. Pharmacodynamic changes were also observed to occur after ACTEMRA administration in PJIA and SJIA patients (decreases in CRP, ESR, and increases in hemoglobin). The relationship between these pharmacodynamic findings and clinical efficacy is not known.
                        In healthy subjects administered ACTEMRA in doses from 2 to 28 mg per kg intravenously and 81 to 162 mg subcutaneously, absolute neutrophil counts decreased to the nadir 3 to 5 days following ACTEMRA administration. Thereafter, neutrophils recovered towards baseline in a dose dependent manner. Rheumatoid arthritis patients demonstrated a similar pattern of absolute neutrophil counts following ACTEMRA administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

                                 Rheumatoid Arthritis—Intravenous Administration
                              
                              The pharmacokinetics characterized in healthy subjects and RA patients suggested that PK is similar between the two populations. The clearance (CL) of tocilizumab decreased with increased doses. At the 10 mg per kg single dose in RA patients, mean CL was 0.29 ± 0.10 mL per hr per kg and mean apparent terminal t1/2 was 151 ± 59 hours (6.3 days).
                              The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 1793 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with ACTEMRA 4 and 8 mg per kg every 4 weeks for 24 weeks.
                              The pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab did not change with time. A more than dose-proportional increase in area under the curve (AUC) and trough concentration (Cmin) was observed for doses of 4 and 8 mg per kg every 4 weeks. Maximum concentration (Cmax) increased dose-proportionally. At steady-state, estimated AUC and Cmin were 2.7 and 6.5-fold higher at 8 mg per kg as compared to 4 mg per kg, respectively. In a long-term study with dosing for 104 weeks, observed Cmin was sustained over time.
                              For doses of ACTEMRA 4 mg per kg given every 4 weeks, the estimated mean (± SD) steady-state AUC, Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 13000 ± 5800 mcg∙h per mL, 1.49 ± 2.13 mcg per mL, and 88.3 ± 41.4 mcg per mL, respectively. The accumulation ratios for AUC and Cmax were 1.11 and 1.02, respectively. The accumulation ratio was higher for Cmin (1.96). Steady-state was reached following the first administration for Cmax and AUC, respectively, and after 16 weeks Cmin. For doses of ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg given every 4 weeks, the estimated mean (± SD) steady-state AUC, Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 35000 ± 15500 mcg∙h per mL, 9.74 ± 10.5 mcg per mL, and 183 ± 85.6 mcg per mL, respectively. The accumulation ratios for AUC and Cmax were 1.22 and 1.06, respectively. The accumulation ratio was higher for Cmin (2.35). Steady-state was reached following the first administration and after 8 and 20 weeks for Cmax, AUC, and Cmin, respectively. Tocilizumab AUC, Cmin and Cmax increased with increase of body weight. At body weight at or above 100 kg, the estimated mean (± SD) steady-state AUC, Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 55500 ± 14100 mcg∙h per mL, 19.0 ± 12.0 mcg per mL, and 269 ± 57 mcg per mL, respectively, which are higher than mean exposure values for the patient population. Therefore, ACTEMRA doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

                              The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab was characterized using a population pharmacokinetic analysis using a database composed of 1759 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with 162 mg SC every week, 162 mg SC every other week, and 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 24 weeks.
                              The pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab did not change with time. For the 162 mg every week dose, the estimated mean (±SD) steady-state AUC1week, Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 8200 ± 3600 mcg∙h/mL, 44.6 ± 20.6 mcg/mL, and 50.9 ± 21.8 mcg/mL, respectively. The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 6.83, 6.37, and 5.47, respectively. Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax.
                              For the 162 mg every other week dose, the estimated mean (±SD) steady-state AUC2week, Cmin, and Cmax of tocilizumab were 3200 ± 2700 mcg∙h/mL, 5.6 ± 7.0 mcg/mL, and 12.3 ± 8.7 mcg/mL, respectively. The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 2.67, 5.6, and 2.12, respectively. Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC and Cmin, and after 10 weeks for Cmax.

                              The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab was determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on a database composed of 188 patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
                              For doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight at or above 30 kg) given every 4 weeks, the estimated mean (± SD) AUC4weeks, Cmax and Cmin of tocilizumab were 29500 ± 8660 mcg∙hr/mL, 182 ± 37 mcg/mL and 7.49 ± 8.2 mcg/mL, respectively.
                              For doses of 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight less than 30 kg) given every 4 weeks, the estimated mean (± SD) AUC4weeks, Cmax and Cmin of tocilizumab were 23200 ± 6100 mcg∙hr/mL, 175 ± 32 mcg/mL and 2.35 ± 3.59 mcg/mL, respectively.
                              The accumulation ratios were 1.05 and 1.16 for AUC4weeks, and 1.43 and 2.22 for Cmin for 10 mg/kg (BW less than 30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (BW at or above 30 kg) doses, respectively. No accumulation for Cmax was observed.

                              The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on a database composed of 75 patients with  SJIA treated with 8 mg per kg (patients with a body weight at or above 30 kg) or 12 mg per kg (patients with a body weight less than 30 kg), given every 2 weeks. The estimated mean (± SD) AUC2 weeks, Cmax and Cmin of tocilizumab were 32200 ± 9960 mcg∙hr per mL, 245 ± 57.2 mcg per mL and 57.5 ± 23.3 mcg per mL, respectively. The accumulation ratio for Cmin (week 12 over week 2) was 3.2 ± 1.3. Steady state was reached on or after week 12. Mean estimated tocilizumab exposure parameters were similar between the two dose groups defined by body weight.

                                    Following SC dosing in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the absorption half-life was around 4 days. The bioavailability for the SC formulation was 0.8.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Distribution
                                    
                                    Following intravenous dosing, tocilizumab undergoes biphasic elimination from the circulation. In rheumatoid arthritis patients the central volume of distribution was 3.5 L and the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.9 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 6.4 L.
                                    In pediatric patients with PJIA, the central volume of distribution was 1.98 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.1 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.08 L.
                                    In pediatric patients with SJIA, the central volume of distribution was 0.94 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 1.60 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 2.54 L.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          Elimination
                                       
                                    
                                    The total clearance of tocilizumab is concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear clearance and the nonlinear clearance. The linear clearance in the population pharmacokinetic analysis was estimated to be 12.5 mL per h in RA, 5.8 mL per h in pediatric patients with PJIA, and 7.1 mL per h in pediatric patients with SJIA. The concentration-dependent nonlinear clearance plays a major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the nonlinear clearance pathway is saturated, at higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance.
                                    The t1/2 of tocilizumab is concentration-dependent. For IV administration, the concentration-dependent apparent t1/2 is up to 11 days for 4 mg per kg and up to 13 days for 8 mg per kg every 4 weeks in patients with RA at steady-state. For SC administration, the concentration-dependent apparent t1/2 is up to 13 days for 162 mg every week and 5 days for 162 mg every other week in patients with RA at steady-state.
                                    The t1/2 of tocilizumab in children with PJIA is up to 16 days for the two body weight categories (8 mg/kg for body weight at or above 30 kg or 10 mg/kg for body weight less than 30 kg) during a dosing interval at steady state.
                                    The t1/2 of tocilizumab in pediatric patients with SJIA is up to 23 days for the two body weight categories at week 12.

                              Population pharmacokinetic analyses in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients showed that age, gender and race did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab. Linear clearance was found to increase with body size. The body weight-based dose (8 mg per kg) resulted in approximately 86% higher exposure in patients who are greater than 100 kg in comparison to patients who are less than 60 kg. There was an inverse relationship between tocilizumab exposure and body weight for flat dose SC regimens.

                                    No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab was conducted.

                                    No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab was conducted.
                                    Most of the RA patients in the population pharmacokinetic analysis had normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 80 mL per min and at or above 50 mL per min based on Cockcroft-Gault) did not impact the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment.

                              In vitro data suggested that IL-6 reduced mRNA expression for several CYP450 isoenzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and this reduced expression was reversed by co-incubation with tocilizumab at clinically relevant concentrations. Accordingly, inhibition of IL-6 signaling in RA patients treated with tocilizumab may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels than those in the absence of tocilizumab leading to increased metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates. Its effect on CYP2C8 or transporters (e.g., P-gp) is unknown. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation of ACTEMRA, in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product adjusted as needed. Caution should be exercised when ACTEMRA is coadministered with drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives (CYP3A4 substrates) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

                                    Simvastatin is a CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 substrate. In 12 RA patients not treated with ACTEMRA, receiving 40 mg simvastatin, exposures of simvastatin and its metabolite, simvastatin acid, was 4- to 10-fold and 2-fold higher, respectively, than the exposures observed in healthy subjects. One week following administration of a single infusion of ACTEMRA (10 mg per kg), exposure of simvastatin and simvastatin acid decreased by 57% and 39%, respectively, to exposures that were similar or slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects. Exposures of simvastatin and simvastatin acid increased upon withdrawal of ACTEMRA in RA patients. Selection of a particular dose of simvastatin in RA patients should take into account the potentially lower exposures that may result after initiation of ACTEMRA (due to normalization of CYP3A4) or higher exposures after discontinuation of ACTEMRA.

                                    Omeprazole is a CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 substrate. In RA patients receiving 10 mg omeprazole, exposure to omeprazole was approximately 2 fold higher than that observed in healthy subjects. In RA patients receiving 10 mg omeprazole, before and one week after ACTEMRA infusion (8 mg per kg), the omeprazole AUCinf decreased by 12% for poor (N=5) and intermediate metabolizers (N=5) and by 28% for extensive metabolizers (N=8) and were slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects.

                                    Dextromethorphan is a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 substrate. In 13 RA patients receiving 30 mg dextromethorphan, exposure to dextromethorphan was comparable to that in healthy subjects. However, exposure to its metabolite, dextrorphan (a CYP3A4 substrate), was a fraction of that observed in healthy subjects. One week following administration of a single infusion of ACTEMRA (8 mg per kg), dextromethorphan exposure was decreased by approximately 5%. However, a larger decrease (29%) in dextrorphan levels was noted after ACTEMRA infusion.
