                     Capsaicin is an active component of chili peppers known clinically as a rubefacient.  It acts as a counter-irritant by producing heat when in contact with human tissue.  Mechanistically, capsaicin exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by mimicking a burning sensation – whereby overwhelming the nerves by calcium influx, thereby rendering the nerves unable to signal a pain response for an extended period of time.  With repeated exposure, the neurons become depleted of neurotransmitters –specifically substance P - leading to a reduction in the sensation of pain and the blockade of neurogenic inflammation.  This process is reversed when the capsaicin is discontinued. 
                  
                     Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it also acts as a weak kappa (κ) opioid receptor agonist.  Menthol acts to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM-8 receptors in the skin - responsible for the well-known cooling sensation it stimulates when applied directly to the skin. Menthol's analgesic properties are not fully understood, however they are mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue.
