                        Concurrent use with lithium or antithyroid drugs may potentiate the hypothyroid and goitrogenic effects of these medications. Concurrent use with potassium-containing medications, potassium-sparing diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) may result in hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
