                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The mechanism of action of brexpiprazole in the treatment of major depressive disorder or schizophrenia is unknown. However, the efficacy of brexpiprazole may be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 receptors, and antagonist activity at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Brexpiprazole has affinity (expressed as Ki) for multiple monoaminergic receptors including serotonin 5HT1A (0.12 nM), 5HT2A (0.47 nM), 5HT2B (1.9 nM), 5HT7 (3.7 nM), dopamine D2 (0.30 nM), D3 (1.1 nM), and noradrenergic α1A (3.8 nM), α1B (0.17 nM), α1D (2.6 nM), and α2C (0.59 nM) receptors. Brexpiprazole acts as a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A, D2, and D3 receptors and as an antagonist at 5HT2A, 5HT2B, 5HT7, α1A, α1B, α1D, and α2C receptors. Brexpiprazole also exhibits affinity for histamine H1 receptor (19 nM) and for muscarinic M1 receptor (67% inhibition at 10 µM).

                              At a dose 3-times the MRHD for the treatment of schizophrenia and 4-times the MRHD for adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD, REXULTI does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

                              After single dose administration of REXULTI tablets, the peak plasma brexpiprazole concentrations occurred within 4 hours after administration; and the absolute oral bioavailability was 95%. Brexpiprazole steady-state concentrations were attained within 10-12 days of dosing. 
                              REXULTI can be administered with or without food. Administration of a 4 mg REXULTI tablet with a standard high fat meal did not significantly affect the Cmax or AUC of brexpiprazole. After single and multiple once daily dose administration, brexpiprazole exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased in proportion to the dose administered. In vitro studies of brexpiprazole did not indicate that brexpiprazole is a substrate of efflux transporters such as MDRI (P-gp) and BCRP.

                              The volume of distribution of brexpiprazole following intravenous administration is high (1.56±0.42 L/kg), indicating extravascular distribution. Brexpiprazole is highly protein bound in plasma (greater than 99%) to serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, and its protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment. Based on results of in vitro studies, brexpiprazole protein binding is not affected by warfarin, diazepam, or digitoxin.

                                     Based on in vitro metabolism studies of brexpiprazole using recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4), the metabolism of brexpiprazole was shown to be mainly mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.
                                 
                                     
                                    In vivo brexpirazole is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. After single- and multiple-dose administrations, brexpiprazole and its major metabolite, DM-3411, were the predominant drug moieties in the systemic circulation. At steady-state, DM-3411 represented 23% to 48% of brexpiprazole exposure (AUC) in plasma. DM-3411 is considered not to contribute to the therapeutic effects of brexpiprazole.
                              
                              Based on in vitro data, brexpiprazole showed little to no inhibition of CYP450 isozymes.

                                     Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled brexpiprazole, approximately 25% and 46% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged brexpiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 14% of the oral dose was recovered unchanged in the feces. Apparent oral clearance of a brexpiprazole oral tablet after once daily administration is 19.8 (±11.4) mL/h/kg. After multiple once daily administration of REXULTI, the terminal elimination half-lives of brexpiprazole and its major metabolite, DM-3411, were 91 hours and 86 hours, respectively.

                                     Effects of other drugs on the exposures of brexpiprazole are summarized in Figure 2. Based on simulation, a 5.1-fold increase in AUC values at steady-state is expected when extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 are administered with both strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. A 4.8-fold increase in mean AUC values at steady-state is expected in poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
