                  Oxymorphone is an opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic 
action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include 
substances such as morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, 
hydrocodone, and tramadol. In addition to analgesia, other pharmacological 
effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, 
respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression. Like all 
pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing 
analgesia, unlike with mixed agonist/antagonists or non-opioid analgesics, where 
there is a limit to the analgesic effect with increasing doses. With pure opioid 
agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose; the ceiling to analgesic 
effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may 
include somnolence and respiratory depression.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Central Nervous System
                     
                        The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. 
However, specific CNS (central nervous system) opioid receptors for endogenous 
compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain 
and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. In 
addition, opioid receptors have also been identified within the PNS (peripheral 
nervous system). The role that these receptors play in these drugsâ€™ analgesic 
effects is unknown.
                        Opioids produce respiratory depression likely by direct action on brain stem 
respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the 
responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon 
dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.
                        Opioids depress the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the 
medulla oblongata. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those 
usually required for analgesia. Opioids cause miosis, even in total darkness. 
Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., 
pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). 
Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose 
situations (see 
                              OVERDOSAGE: Signs and 
Symptoms
                           ).
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle
                     
                        Opioids cause a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth 
muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the 
small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive 
peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the 
point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may 
include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of 
sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.

                        Opioids produce peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic 
hypotension. Release of histamine can occur and may contribute to opioid-induced 
hypotension. Manifestations of histamine release may include orthostatic 
hypotension, pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating. Animal studies have 
shown that oxymorphone has a lower propensity to cause histamine release than 
other opioids.

                        Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on the secretion of 
hormones. Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, and luteinizing 
hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) 
secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon in humans and other 
species, rats and dogs. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) has been shown to be 
both inhibited and stimulated by opioids.

                        Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on 
components of the immune system in in vitro and 
animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

                        Concentration-Efficacy RelationshipsStudies in healthy volunteers reveal predictable relationships 
between OPANA ER dosage and plasma oxymorphone concentrations.
                        The minimum effective plasma concentration of oxymorphone for analgesia 
varies widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously 
treated with agonist opioids. As a result, patients need to be individually 
titrated to achieve a balance between therapeutic and adverse effects. The 
minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxymorphone for any individual 
patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, progression of 
disease, development of a new pain syndrome and/or potential development of 
analgesic tolerance.
                        
                        Concentration-Adverse Experience RelationshipsOPANA ER is associated with typical opioid-related adverse 
experiences. There is a general relationship between increasing opioid plasma 
concentration and increasing frequency of adverse experiences such as nausea, 
vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression.
                        As with all opioids, the dose must be individualized (see 
                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                           
                           ). 
The effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be 
tolerated by other patients.

                        AbsorptionThe absolute oral bioavailability of oxymorphone is approximately 
10%.
                        Steady-state levels are achieved after three days of multiple dose 
administration. Under both single-dose and steady-state conditions, dose 
proportionality has been established for the 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg 
tablet strengths for both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and 
extent of absorption (AUC) (Table 1).

Food EffectTwo studies examined the effect of food on the bioavailability of 
single doses of 20 and 40 mg of OPANA ER in healthy volunteers. In both studies, 
after the administration of OPANA ER, the Cmax was 
increased by approximately 50% in fed subjects compared to fasted subjects. A 
similar increase in Cmax was also observed with oxymorphone solution.
                        The AUC was unchanged in one study and increased by approximately 18% in the 
other study in fed subjects following the administration of OPANA ER. 
Examination of the AUC suggests that most of the difference between fed and 
fasting conditions occurs in the first four hours after dose administration. 
After oral dosing with a single dose of 40 mg, a peak oxymorphone plasma level 
of 2.8 ng/ml is achieved at 1 hour in fasted subjects and a peak of 4.25 ng/ml 
is achieved at 2 hours in fed subjects and that beyond the 12 hour time point, 
there is very little difference in the curves. As a result, OPANA ER should be 
dosed at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating (see
                                    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                           ).
                        
                        
                        
Ethanol Effect

                        
In Vivo OPANA ER Formulation-Alcohol InteractionAlthough in vitro studies have 
demonstrated that OPANA ER does not release oxymorphone more rapidly in 500 mL 
of 0.1N HCl solutions containing ethanol (4%, 20%, and 40%), there is an in vivo interaction with alcohol. An in 
vivo study examined the effect of alcohol (40%, 20%, 4% and 0%) on the 
bioavailability of a single dose of 40 mg of OPANA ER in healthy, fasted 
volunteers. The results showed that the oxymorphone mean AUC was 13% higher (not 
statistically significant) after co-administration of 240 mL of 40% alcohol. The 
AUC was essentially unaffected in subjects following the co-administration of 
OPANA ER and ethanol (240 mL of 20% or 4% ethanol).
                        There was a highly variable effect on Cmax with 
concomitant administration of alcohol and OPANA ER. The change in Cmax ranged from a decrease of 50% to an increase of 270% across 
all conditions studied. Following concomitant administration of 240 mL of 40% 
ethanol the Cmax increased on average by 70% and up to 
270% in individual subjects. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL 
of 20% ethanol, the Cmax increased on average by 31% and 
up to 260% in individual subjects. Following the concomitant administration of 
240 mL of 4 % ethanol, the Cmax increased 7% on average 
and by as much as 110% for individual subjects. After oral dosing with a single 
dose of 40 mg in fasted subjects, the mean peak oxymorphone plasma level is 2.4 
ng/mL and the median Tmax is 2 hours. Following 
co-administration of OPANA ER and alcohol (240 mL of 40% ethanol) in fasted 
subjects, the mean peak oxymorphone level is 3.9 ng/mL and the median Tmax is 1.5 hours (range 0.75 â€“ 6 hours).
                        Co-administration of oxymorphone and ethanol must be avoided.
                        Oxymorphone may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction 
with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system 
depression because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, 
coma, or death may result.
                        
                        
                        
DistributionFormal studies on the distribution of oxymorphone in various 
tissues have not been conducted. Oxymorphone is not extensively bound to human 
plasma proteins; binding is in the range of 10% to 12%.
                        
                        
                        
MetabolismOxymorphone is highly metabolized principally in the liver and 
undergoes reduction or conjugation with glucuronic acid to form both active and 
inactive metabolites. The two major metabolites of oxymorphone are 
oxymorphone-3-glucuronide and 6-OH-oxymorphone. The mean plasma AUC for 
oxymorphone-3-glucuronide is approximately 90-fold higher than the parent 
compound. The pharmacologic activity of the glucuronide metabolite has not been 
evaluated. 6-OH-oxymorphone has been shown in animal studies to have analgesic 
bioactivity. The mean plasma 6-OH-oymorphone AUC is approximately 70% of the 
oxymorphone AUC following single oral doses, but is essentially equivalent to 
the parent compound at steady-state.
                        
                        
                        
ExcretionBecause oxymorphone is extensively metabolized, less than 1% of the 
administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. On average, 33% to 38% of 
the administered dose is excreted in the urine as oxymorphone-3-glucuronide and 
0.25% to 0.62% excreted as 6-OH-oxymorphone in subjects with normal hepatic and 
renal function. In animals given radiolabeled oxymorphone, approximately 90% of 
the administered radioactivity was recovered within 5 days of dosing. The 
majority of oxymorphone-derived radioactivity was found in the urine and 
feces.
                        
                        
                        
Special Populations
                        

                        
ElderlyThe steady-state plasma concentrations of oxymorphone, 
6-OH-oxymorphone, and oxymorphone-3-glucuronide are approximately 40% higher in 
elderly subjects (â‰¥ 65 years of age) than in young subjects (18 to 40 years of 
age). On average, age greater than 65 years was associated with a 1.4-fold 
increase in oxymorphone AUC and a 1.5-fold increase in Cmax. This observation does not appear related to a difference 
in body weight, metabolism, or excretion of oxymorphone (see 
                                   PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use
                           ).
                        
                        
                        
GenderThe effect of gender was evaluated following single- and 
multiple-doses of OPANA ER in male and female adult volunteers. There was a 
consistent tendency for female subjects to have slightly higher AUCss and Cmax values than male subjects; 
however, gender differences were not observed when AUCss 
and Cmax were adjusted by body weight.
                        
                        
                        
Hepatic ImpairmentThe liver plays an important role in the pre-systemic clearance 
of orally administered oxymorphone. Accordingly, the bioavailability of orally 
administered oxymorphone may be markedly increased in patients with moderate to 
severe liver disease. The disposition of oxymorphone was compared in 6 patients 
with mild, 5 patients with moderate, and one patient with severe hepatic 
impairment and 12 subjects with normal hepatic function. The bioavailability of 
oxymorphone was increased by 1.6-fold in patients with mild hepatic impairment 
and by 3.7-fold in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In one patient 
with severe hepatic impairment, the bioavailability was increased by 12.2-fold. 
The half-life of oxymorphone was not significantly affected by hepatic 
impairment (see 
                                   DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION: Patients with Hepatic Impairment
                           ).
                        
                        
                        
Renal ImpairmentData from a pharmacokinetic study involving 24 patients with 
renal dysfunction show an increase of 26%, 57%, and 65% in oxymorphone 
bioavailability in mild (creatinine clearance 51-80 mL/min; n=8), moderate 
(creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min; n=8), and severe (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min; n=8) patients, respectively, compared to healthy controls.
                        

                        

                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Drug-Drug Interactions
                     
                        
                           In vitro studies revealed little to no 
biotransformation of oxymorphone to 6-OH-oxymorphone by any of the major 
cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) isoforms at therapeutically relevant oxymorphone 
plasma concentrations.
                        No inhibition of any of the major CYP P450 isoforms was observed when 
oxymorphone was incubated with human liver microsomes at concentrations of â‰¤ 50 
Î¼M. An inhibition of CYP3A4 activity occurred at oxymorphone concentrations â‰¥150 
ÂµM. Therefore, it is not expected that oxymorphone, or its metabolites will act 
as inhibitors of any of the major CYP P450 enzymes in 
vivo.
                        Increases in the activity of the CYP 2C9 and CYP 3A4 isoforms occurred when 
oxymorphone was incubated with human hepatocytes. However, clinical drug 
interaction studies with OPANA ER showed no induction of CYP450 3A4 or 2C9 
enzyme activity, indicating that no dose adjustment for CYP 3A4- or 2C9-mediated 
drug-drug interactions is required.
