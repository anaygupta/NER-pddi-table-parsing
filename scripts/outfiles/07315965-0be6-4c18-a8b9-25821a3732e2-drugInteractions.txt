Drug Interactions:  A monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, a tricyclic antidepressant, or guanethidine may increase the cardiac and pressor effects of phenylephrine and isoproterenol; however, normal volunteers given isoproterenol by inhalation along with an MAO inhibitor or a tricyclic antidepressant had no adverse cardio­vascular effects.Drug Interactions:  A monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, a tricyclic antidepressant, or guanethidine may increase the cardiac and pressor effects of phenylephrine and isoproterenol; however, normal volunteers given isoproterenol by inhalation along with an MAO inhibitor or a tricyclic antidepressant had no adverse cardio­vascular effects.Arrhythmias may result from the concurrent administration of isoproterenol or phenylephrine to patients who are receiving digitalis, epinephrine, cyclopropane, or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics.Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs such as propranolol antagonize the cardiac, bronchodilating, and vasodilating effects of isoproterenol and the stimulating effects of phenylephrine.Ergot alkaloids may increase blood pressure in patients receiving iso­proterenol or phenylephrine. Phentolamine mesylate (Regitine®), an alpha-adrenergic blocker, may decrease the pressor response to phenylephrine.®), an alpha-adrenergic blocker, may decrease the pressor response to phenylephrine.Phenothiazine drugs have some alpha-adrenergic blocking activity and may reduce the pressor effects and duration of action of phenylephrine.
