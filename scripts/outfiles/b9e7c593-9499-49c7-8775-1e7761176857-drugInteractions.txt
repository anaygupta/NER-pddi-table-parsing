                  Oxcarbazepine can inhibit CYP2C19 and induce CYP3A4/5 with 
potentially important effects on plasma concentrations of other drugs. In 
addition, several AEDs that are cytochrome P450 inducers can decrease plasma 
concentrations of oxcarbazepine and MHD.
                  Oxcarbazepine was evaluated in human liver microsomes to determine its 
capacity to inhibit the major cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the 
metabolism of other drugs. Results demonstrate that oxcarbazepine and its 
pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD) have little or no 
capacity to function as inhibitors for most of the human cytochrome P450 enzymes 
evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP4A9 and CYP4A11) with the 
exception of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. Although inhibition of CYP3A4/5 by 
oxcarbazepine and MHD did occur at high concentrations, it is not likely to be 
of clinical significance. The inhibition of CYP2C19 by oxcarbazepine and MHD, 
however, is clinically relevant (see below). 
                  In vitro, the UDP-glucuronyl transferase level was increased, indicating 
induction of this enzyme. Increases of 22% with MHD and 47% with oxcarbazepine 
were observed. As MHD, the predominant plasma substrate, is only a weak inducer 
of UDP-glucuronyl transferase, it is unlikely to have an effect on drugs that 
are mainly eliminated by conjugation through UDP-glucuronyl transferase (e.g., 
valproic acid, lamotrigine).
                  In addition, oxcarbazepine and MHD induce a subgroup of the cytochrome P450 
3A family (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) responsible for the metabolism of dihydropyridine 
calcium antagonists and oral contraceptives, resulting in a lower plasma 
concentration of these drugs.
                  As binding of MHD to plasma proteins is low (40%), clinically significant 
interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are 
unlikely.
                  

                  Antiepileptic DrugsPotential interactions between Oxcarbazepine and other AEDs were 
assessed in clinical studies. The effect of these interactions on mean AUCs and 
Cmin are summarized in Table 3.
                  


                  




                  In vivo, the plasma levels of phenytoin increased by up to 40% when 
Oxcarbazepine was given at doses above 1200 mg/day. Therefore, when using doses 
of Oxcarbazepine greater than 1200 mg/day during adjunctive therapy, a decrease 
in the dose of phenytoin may be required. The increase of phenobarbital level, 
however, is small (15%) when given with Oxcarbazepine.
                  Strong inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes (i.e., carbamazepine, phenytoin 
and phenobarbital) have been shown to decrease the plasma levels of MHD 
(29%-40%).
                  No autoinduction has been observed with Oxcarbazepine.
                  
                  Hormonal ContraceptivesCoadministration of Oxcarbazepine with an oral contraceptive has 
been shown to influence the plasma concentrations of the two hormonal 
components, ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG). The mean AUC values 
of EE were decreased by 48% [90% CI: 22-65] in one study and 52% [90% CI: 38-52] 
in another study. The mean AUC values of LNG were decreased by 32% [90% CI: 
20-45] in one study and 52% [90% CI: 42-52] in another study. Therefore, 
concurrent use of Oxcarbazepine with hormonal contraceptives may render these 
contraceptives less effective (see Drug 
Interactions subsection). Studies with other oral or implant contraceptives 
have not been conducted.
                  
                  Calcium AntagonistsAfter repeated coadministration of Oxcarbazepine, the AUC of 
felodipine was lowered by 28% [90% CI: 20-33].
                  Verapamil produced a decrease of 20% [90% CI: 18-27] of the plasma levels of 
MHD.
                  
                  Other Drug InteractionsCimetidine, erythromycin and dextropropoxyphene had no effect on 
the pharmacokinetics of MHD. Results with warfarin show no evidence of 
interaction with either single or repeated doses of Oxcarbazepine.
                  
                  Drug/Laboratory Test InteractionsThere are no known interactions of Oxcarbazepine with commonly 
used laboratory tests.
                  
                  Carcinogenesis/Mutagenesis/Impairment of 
FertilityIn two-year carcinogenicity studies, oxcarbazepine was 
administered in the diet at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day to mice and by gavage 
at doses of up to 250 mg/kg to rats, and the pharmacologically active 10-hydroxy 
metabolite (MHD) was administered orally at doses of up to 600 mg/kg/day to 
rats. In mice, a dose-related increase in the incidence of hepatocellular 
adenomas was observed at oxcarbazepine doses less then 70 mg/kg/day or approximately 0.1 
times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis. In rats, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas 
was increased in females treated with oxcarbazepine at doses less then 25 mg/kg/day (0.1 
times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis), and incidences of 
hepatocellular adenomas and/or carcinomas were increased in males and females 
treated with MHD at doses of 600 mg/kg/day (2.4 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and less then 250 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the MRHD on a 
mg/m2 basis), respectively. There was an increase in the 
incidence of benign testicular interstitial cell tumors in rats at 250 mg 
oxcarbazepine/kg/day and at less then 250 mg MHD/kg/day, and an increase in the incidence 
of granular cell tumors in the cervix and vagina in rats at 600 mg 
MHD/kg/day.
                  Oxcarbazepine increased mutation frequencies in the Ames test in vitro in the 
absence of metabolic activation in one of five bacterial strains. Both 
oxcarbazepine and MHD produced increases in chromosomal aberrations and 
polyploidy in the Chinese hamster ovary assay in vitro in the absence of 
metabolic activation. MHD was negative in the Ames test and no mutagenic or 
clastogenic activity was found with either oxcarbazepine or MHD in V79 Chinese 
hamster cells in vitro. Oxcarbazepine and MHD were both negative for clastogenic 
or aneugenic effects (micronucleus formation) in an in vivo rat bone marrow 
assay.
                  In a fertility study in which rats were administered MHD (50, 150, or 450 
mg/kg) orally prior to and during mating and early gestation, estrous cyclicity 
was disrupted and numbers of corpora lutea, implantations, and live embryos were 
reduced in females receiving the highest dose (approximately two times the MRHD 
on a mg/m2 basis).
