                  Pancrelipase capsules resist gastric inactivation and deliver predicable, high levels of biologically active enzymes into the duodenum. The enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of fats into glycerol and fatty acids, protein into proteoses and derived substances, and starch into dextrins and sugars. Pancrelipase capsules are effective in controlling steatorrhea and its consequences at low daily dosage levels.
