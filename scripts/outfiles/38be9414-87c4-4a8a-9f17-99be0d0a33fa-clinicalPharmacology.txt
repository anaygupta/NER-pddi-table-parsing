12.1 Mechanism of Action
The mechanism by which OraVerse accelerates reversal of soft-tissue anesthesia and the associated functional deficits is not fully understood.  Phentolamine mesylate, the active ingredient in OraVerse, produces an alpha-adrenergic block of relatively short duration resulting in vasodilatation when applied to vascular smooth muscle.  In an animal model, OraVerse increased local blood flow in submucosal tissue of the dog when given after an intraoral injection of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine.







12.3 Pharmacokinetics
Following OraVerse administration, phentolamine is 100% available from the submucosal injection site and peak concentrations are achieved 10-20 minutes after injection.  Phentolamine systemic exposure increased linearly after 0.8 mg compared to 0.4 mg OraVerse intraoral submucosal injection.  The terminal elimination half-life of phentolamine in the blood was approximately 2-3 hours.PediatricsPediatricsFollowing OraVerse administration, the phentolamine Cmax was higher (approximately 3.5-fold) in children who weighed between 15 and 30 kg (33 and 66 lbs) than in children who weighed more than 30 kg. However, phentolamine AUC was similar between the two groups. It is recommended that in children weighing 15-30 kg, the maximum dose of OraVerse should be limited to ½ cartridge (0.2 mg) (see Dosage and Administration section).max was higher (approximately 3.5-fold) in children who weighed between 15 and 30 kg (33 and 66 lbs) than in children who weighed more than 30 kg.

The pharmacokinetics of OraVerse after administration of more than 1 cartridge (0.4mg) has not been studied in children.
