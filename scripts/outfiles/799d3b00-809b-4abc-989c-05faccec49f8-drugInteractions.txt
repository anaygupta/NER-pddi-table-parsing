                  In clinical trials in patients undergoing PCI/PTCA, co-administration of Angiomax with heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics, or GPIs was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
                  There is no experience with co-administration of Angiomax and plasma expanders such as dextran.
