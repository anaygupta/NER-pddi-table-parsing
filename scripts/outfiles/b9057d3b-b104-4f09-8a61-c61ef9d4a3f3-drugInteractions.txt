                           UGT inducers (e.g., rifampin): Canagliflozin exposure is reduced. Consider increasing dose from 100 mg to 300 mg (2.3, 7.1)

                     7.1	UGT Enzyme Inducers
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Rifampin: Co-administration of canagliflozin with rifampin, a nonselective inducer of several UGT enzymes, including UGT1A9, UGT2B4, decreased canagliflozin area under the curve (AUC) by 51%. This decrease in exposure to canagliflozin may decrease efficacy. If an inducer of these UGTs (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) must be co-administered with INVOKANA (canagliflozin), consider increasing the dose to 300 mg once daily if patients are currently tolerating INVOKANA 100 mg once daily, have an eGFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and require additional glycemic control. Consider other antihyperglycemic therapy in patients with an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 receiving concurrent therapy with a UGT inducer and require additional glycemic control [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                           
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Digoxin
                     
                        There was an increase in the AUC and mean peak drug concentration (Cmax) of digoxin (20% and 36%, respectively) when co-administered with INVOKANA 300 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients taking INVOKANA with concomitant digoxin should be monitored appropriately.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	Positive Urine Glucose Test
                     
                        Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4	Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay
                     
                        Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.
