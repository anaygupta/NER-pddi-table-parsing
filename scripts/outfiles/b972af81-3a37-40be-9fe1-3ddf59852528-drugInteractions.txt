                               to 50% of target dosage when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (2.7).
                            Strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease guanfacine exposure. Based on patient response, consider titrating INTUNIV dosage up to double the target dosage over 1 to 2 weeks (2.7).
