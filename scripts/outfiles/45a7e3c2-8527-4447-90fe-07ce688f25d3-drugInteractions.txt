                        Although acid-base and electrolyte disturbances were not reported in the clinical trials with Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution, these disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and have, in some instances, resulted in drug interactions (e.g., toxicity associated with high-dose salicylate therapy). Therefore, the potential for such drug interactions should be considered in patients receiving Dorzolamide HCl Ophthalmic Solution.
