                  Hydrocortisone sodium succinate has the same metabolic
and anti-inflammatory actions as hydrocortisone. When given parenterally
and in equimolar quantities, the two compounds are equivalent in biologic
activity. Following the intravenous injection of hydrocortisone sodium
succinate, demonstrable effects are evident within one hour and persist
for a variable period. Excretion of the administered dose is nearly
complete within 12 hours. Thus, if constantly high blood levels are
required, injections should be made every 4 to 6 hours. This preparation
is also rapidly absorbed when administered intramuscularly and is
excreted in a pattern similar to that observed after intravenous injection.
