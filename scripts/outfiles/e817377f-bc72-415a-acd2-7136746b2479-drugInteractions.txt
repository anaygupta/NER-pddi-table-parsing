                        Methylphenidate hydrochloride may
decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine. Use cautiously with pressor
agents.
                        Human pharmacologic studies have shown
that methylphenidate hydrochloride may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin
anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, primidone),
phenylbutazone, and tricyclic drugs (imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine).
Downward dosage adjustments of these drugs may be required when given
concomitantly with methylphenidate hydrochloride.
