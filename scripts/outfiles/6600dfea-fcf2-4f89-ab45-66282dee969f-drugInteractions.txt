                        The potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions posed by dolasetron and hydrodolasetron appears to be low for drugs commonly used in surgery, because hydrodolasetron is eliminated by multiple routes. See PRECAUTIONS, General for information about potential interaction with other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. 
                        When oral dolasetron (200 mg once daily) was coadministered with cimetidine (300 mg four times daily) for 7 days, the systemic exposure (i.e., AUC) of hydrodolasetron increased by 24% and the maximum plasma concentration of hydrodolasetron increased by 15%. When oral dolasetron (200 mg once daily) was coadministered with rifampin (600 mg once daily) for 7 days, the systemic exposure of hydrodolasetron decreased by 28% and the maximum plasma concentration of hydrodolasetron decreased by 17%.
                        Caution should be exercised when ANZEMET Injection is coadministered with drugs that prolong ECG intervals and/or cause hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (see WARNINGS).
                        In patients taking furosemide, nifedipine, diltiazem, ACE inhibitors, verapamil, glyburide, and propranolol, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Clearance of hydrodolasetron decreased by about 27% when dolasetron mesylate was administered intravenously concomitantly with atenolol. ANZEMET did not influence anesthesia recovery time in patients. 
                        Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
