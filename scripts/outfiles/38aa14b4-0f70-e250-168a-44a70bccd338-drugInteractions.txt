                           Hypotension
                           
Patients on diuretics, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with benazepril hydrochloride tablets. The possibility of hypotensive effects with benazepril hydrochloride can be minimized by either discontinuing or decreasing the dose of diuretic prior to initiation of treatment with benazepril hydrochloride tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
                        
                        
                           Hyperkalemia
                           
Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor the patientâ€™s serum potassium frequently. Benazepril hydrochloride attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Antidiabetics
                     
                        Concomitant administration of benazepril hydrochloride tablets and antidiabetic medicines (insulins, oral hypoglycemic agents) may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)
                     
                        In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including benazepril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving benazepril and NSAID therapy.
                        The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including benazepril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)
                     
                        Dual Blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on benazepril hydrochloride and other agents that affect the RAS.
                        Do not co-administer aliskiren with benazepril hydrochloride tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with benazepril hydrochloride tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitors
                     
                        Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Monitor for signs of angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6 Lithium
                     
                        Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with benazepril hydrochloride tablets. Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium or benazepril. Monitor serum lithium levels during concurrent use.

                        Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy.
