Aminoglycosides
The mixing
of piperacillin with an aminoglycoside in vitro can result in substantial inactivation of the
aminoglycoside.in vitro can result in substantial inactivation of the
aminoglycoside.







Vecuronium
When used
in the perioperative period, piperacillin has been implicated in the
prolongation of the neuromuscular blockade of vecuronium. Caution
is indicated when piperacillin is used perioperatively. In one controlled
clinical study, the ureidopenicillins, including piperacillin, were
reported to prolong the action of vecuronium. Due to their similar
mechanism of action, it is expected that the neuromuscular blockade
produced by any of the non-depolarizing muscle relaxants could be
prolonged in the presence of piperacillin.







Probenecid
The oral
combination of probenecid before intramuscular injection of PIPRACIL
produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.







Anticoagulants
Coagulation
parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly
during simultaneous administration of high doses of heparin, oral
anticoagulants, or other drugs that may affect the blood coagulation
system or the thrombocyte function.







Methotrexate
Piperacillin
sodium may reduce the excretion of methotrexate. Therefore, serum
levels of methotrexate should be monitored in patients to avoid drug
toxicity.
