                  Pharmacologically, Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Tablets combine the analgesic properties of aspirin with the anxiolytic and muscle relaxant properties of butalbital.
                  The clinical effectiveness of a product containing butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine in tension headache has been established in double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiclinic trials. A factorial design study compared the combination product with each of its major components. This study demonstrated that each component contributes to the efficacy of the combination product in the treatment of the target symptoms of tension headache (headache pain, psychic tension, and muscle contraction in the head, neck, and shoulder region). For each symptom and the symptom complex as a whole, the product containing butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine was shown to have significantly superior clinical effects to either of the major components alone.
