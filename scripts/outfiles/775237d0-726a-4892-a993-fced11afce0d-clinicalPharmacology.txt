                  Isometheptene Mucate is a sympathomimetic amine, acts by constricting dilated cranial and cerebral arterioles, thus reducing the stimuli that lead to vascular headaches.
                  Dichloralphenazone is a mild sedative, reduces the patient's emotional reaction to the pain of both vascular and tension headaches.
                  Acetaminophen raises the threshold to painful stimuli, thus exerting an analgesic effect against all types of headaches.
