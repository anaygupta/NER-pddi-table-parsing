                  Potassium ion is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues.  Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes, including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle, and the maintenance of normal renal function.
                  The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter.  The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter.  An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane.
                  Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine.  The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day.
                  Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake.  Such depletion usually develops slowly as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primary or secondary hyperaldosteronisms, diabetic ketoacidosis, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition.
                  Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting.  Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by a concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.  Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and in advanced cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine.
                  If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, e.g., where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels.
                  In rare circumstances (e.g., patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia.  In such patients potassium replacement should be accomplished with potassium salts other than the chloride, such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate, or potassium gluconate.
