                  Carfilzomib is primarily metabolized via peptidase and epoxide hydrolase activities, and as a result, the pharmacokinetic profile of carfilzomib is unlikely to be affected by concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 inhibitors and inducers.  Carfilzomib is not expected to influence exposure of other drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
