                  The mode of action of allergenic extracts is still under investigation. The pharmacological action of allergenic extracts used diagnostically is based on the liberation of histamine and other substances when the allergen reacts with IgE antibodies attached to the mast cells.  When allergen extracts are used for therapeutic immunotherapy, the effect is an increase in immunoglobulin G (IgG) and an increased T suppresser lymphocyte which interferes with the allergenic response.(15)  Although immunotherapy may be considered as immunosuppression, in which the production of allergen-specific antibody is inhibited, the mechanism of the clinical effectiveness of immunotherapy remains under investigation.
