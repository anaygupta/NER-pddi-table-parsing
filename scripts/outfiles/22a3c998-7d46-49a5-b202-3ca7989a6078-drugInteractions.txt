                        Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
                        Since bacterial antibiotics, such as the tetracycline class of antibiotics, may interfere with the bactericidal action of members of the Î²-lactam (e.g. penicillin) class of antibiotics, it is not advisable to administer these antibiotics concomitantly.
                        Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations, and by bismuth subsalicylate.
                        Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline.
                        The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
                        Concurrent use of tetracyclines may render oral contraceptives less effective.
