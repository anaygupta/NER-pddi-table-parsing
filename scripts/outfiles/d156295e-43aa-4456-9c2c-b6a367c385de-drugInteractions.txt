                        In controlled trials, terazosin capsules have been added to diuretics, and several beta-adrenergic blockers; no unexpected interactions were observed. Terazosin capsules have also been used in patients on a variety of concomitant therapies; while these were not formal interaction studies, no interactions were observed. Terazosin capsules have been used concomitantly in at least 50 patients on the following drugs or drug classes:
