                  No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted; however, drug interactions are not expected to occur [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1  Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions
                     
                        Administration of LUPRON DEPOT-PED in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Therefore, diagnostic tests of pituitary gonadotropic and gonadal functions conducted during treatment and up to six months after discontinuation of LUPRON DEPOT-PED may be affected. Normal pituitary-gonadal function is usually restored within six months after treatment with LUPRON DEPOT-PED is discontinued.
