                  Tyzeka is excreted mainly by passive diffusion so the potential for interactions between Tyzeka and other drugs eliminated by renal excretion is low. However, because Tyzeka is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, coadministration of Tyzeka with drugs that alter renal function may alter plasma concentrations of Tyzeka [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  A clinical trial investigating the combination of Tyzeka, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination is associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy occurrence and severity, in comparison to Tyzeka or pegylated interferon alfa-2a alone [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Coadministration of Tyzeka with drugs that affect renal function may alter plasma concentrations of Tyzeka and/or coadministered drug (7).

                           
                           Coadministration of Tyzeka with pegylated interferon alfa-2a increases the risk and severity of peripheral neuropathy (7).
