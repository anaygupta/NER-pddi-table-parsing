                     12.1	Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The mechanism of action of TachoSil is based on the interaction between the active biological substances (human fibrinogen and human thrombin) and the physiology of the fibrin clot formation (Fig. 3A). Upon contact with a bleeding wound surface, the active substances coated onto the equine collagen patch become dissolved and partly diffuse into the wound surface. The subsequent fibrinogen-thrombin reaction initiates the last step in the cascade of biochemical reactions-conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin monomers that further polymerize to form the fibrin clot.
                        Hemostasis is achieved when the formed fibrin clot adheres the collagen patch to the wound surface, thus providing a physical barrier to bleeding (Fig 3B). TachoSil exhibits flexibility to accommodate for the physiological movements of tissues and organs and can withstand pressures up to 61.4 hPa (46.1 mmHg).
