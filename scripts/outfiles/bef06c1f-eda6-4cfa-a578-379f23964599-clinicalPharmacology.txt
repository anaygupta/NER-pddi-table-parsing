                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Triferic contains iron in the form of ferric pyrophosphate citrate and is added to hemodialysate solution to be administered to patients by transfer across the dialyzer membrane.  Iron delivered into the circulation binds to transferrin for transport to erythroid precursor cells to be incorporated into hemoglobin.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of serum iron was investigated in healthy volunteers administered 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 mg Triferic intravenously over 4 hours, or 15 mg and 20 mg Triferic intravenously over 12 hours. After correcting for the basal iron levels, the AUC and Cmax of baseline-corrected serum iron increased in a dose proportional manner.  The half-life of serum iron was approximately 1.48 hours, the mean clearance (CL) ranged from 0.406 to 0.556 L/hour, the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz) ranged from 0.765 to 0.859 L after a 4 hour intravenous administration of Triferic.  Compared to the 4 hour infusion of Triferic, higher mean CL and Vz were observed following the administration of Triferic 15 mg (CL = 0.672 L/hour and Vz = 1.66 L) and Triferic 20 mg (CL = 0.661 L/hour, Vz = 2.08L) infused over 12 hours. In a study that assessed the impact of different dialysis conditions on iron delivery in patients administered Triferic via hemodialysis, a reduction of the blood and dialysate flow rates (Qb/Qd of 200/400 mL/min vs. ≥ 350/ ≥ 600 mL/min) resulted in a 33% decrease in the median cumulative iron delivered.
