                        There is evidence that the anticonvulsant action of phenytoin is antagonized by folci acid. A patient whose apilepsy is completely controlled by phenytoin may require increased doses to prevent convulsions if folic acid is given.
                        Folate deficiency may result from increased loss of folate, as in renal dialysis and/or interference with metabolism (i.g., folic acid antagonists such as methotrxate); the administration of anticonvulsants, such as diphenythdantoin, primidone, and barbiturates; alcohol consumption and , especially, alcoholic cirrhosis; and theÂ  administration of pyrimethamine and nitrofurantoin. 
                        False low serum and red cell folate levels may occur if the patient has been taking antibiotics, such as tetracycline, which suppress the growth of Lactobacillus casei.
