                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        When one gram dose of NORITATE cream, 1%, was applied in a single application to the face of 16 healthy volunteers, low concentrations of metronidazole were detected in the plasma of 7 of the volunteers. The mean ± SD Cmax of metronidazole was 27.6 ± 7.3 ng/mL, which is about 1% of the value reported for a single 250 mg oral dose of metronidazole. The time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) in the volunteers with detectable metronidazole was 8–12 hours after topical application.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        The mechanisms by which metronidazole acts in reducing inflammatory lesions of rosacea are unknown.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Clinical Studies
                     
                        Safety and efficacy of NORITATE were evaluated in two randomized vehicle-controlled clinical studies for the treatment of rosacea, which excluded patients who had nodules, moderate or severe rhinophyma, dense telangiectases, plaque-like facial edema or ocular involvement and those who had a history of not responding to metronidazole therapy for rosacea. Of the patients included in the efficacy database (n=416), there were 142 men and 274 women. Endpoint efficacy data comparisons for patients treated with daily NORITATE or vehicle applications are listed below.

                              Studies of contact sensitization (n=258), phototoxicity (n=21), and photocontact sensitization (n=29) of NORITATE were conducted. No evidence of sensitization or phototoxicity was seen in these studies.
