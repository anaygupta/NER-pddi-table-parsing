                        Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate (5.10, 7.1, 7.2). Coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase cabozantinib exposure (2.1, 5.10, 7.1). Chronic co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers can reduce cabozantinib exposure. (2.1, 5.10, 7.2).
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                     
                        Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days) to healthy subjects increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC0-inf) by 38%. Avoid taking a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) when taking COMETRIQ [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Effect of CYP3A4 Inducers
                     
                        Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin (600 mg daily for 31 days) to healthy subjects decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC0-inf) by 77%. Avoid chronic co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, St. Johnâ€™s Wort) with COMETRIQ [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
