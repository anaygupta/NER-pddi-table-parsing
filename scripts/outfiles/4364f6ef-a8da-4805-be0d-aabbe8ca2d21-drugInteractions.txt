                     7.1 Cholinomimetic and Anticholinergic Drugs
                     
                        Increased cholinergic effects may be expected when rivastigmine is given with other cholinomimetic drugs. Rivastigmine may also interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. Avoid concomitant use of rivastigmine with drugs having these pharmacologic effects unless deemed clinically necessary.
