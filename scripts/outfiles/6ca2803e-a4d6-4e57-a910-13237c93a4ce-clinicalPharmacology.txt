                  MoviPrep produces a watery stool leading to cleansing of the 
colon. The osmotic activity of polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, sodium 
chloride, potassium chloride, sodium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid, when taken 
with 1 liter of additional clear fluid, usually results in no net absorption or 
excretion of ions or water. 
                  

                  The pharmacokinetics of MoviPrep have not been studied in patients with renal 
or hepatic insufficiency.
