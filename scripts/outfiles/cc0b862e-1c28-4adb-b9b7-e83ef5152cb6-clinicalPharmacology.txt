                  Methylphenidate Hydrochloride is mild central nervous system stimulant.
                  The mode of action in man is not completely understood, but Methylphenidate Hydrochloride presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its stimulant effect.
                  There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby Methylphenidate Hydrochloride produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system.
                  Methylphenidate hydrochloride in the ER tablets is more slowly but as extensively absorbed as in the regular tablets. Relative bioavailability of the extended-release tablet compared to the immediate-release tablet, measured by the urinary excretion of methylphenidate major metabolite (Î±-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid) was 105% (49% to 168%) in children and 101% (85% to 152%) in adults. The time to peak rate in children was 4.7 hours (1.3 to 8.2 hours) for the extended-release tablets and 1.9 hours (0.3 to 4.4 hours) for the tablets. An average of 67% of extended-release tablet dose was excreted in children as compared to 86% in adults.
                  In a clinical study involving adult subjects who received extended-release tablets, plasma concentrations of methylphenidate hydrochloride's major metabolite appeared to be greater in females than in males. No gender differences were observed for methylphenidate hydrochloride's plasma concentration in the same subjects.
