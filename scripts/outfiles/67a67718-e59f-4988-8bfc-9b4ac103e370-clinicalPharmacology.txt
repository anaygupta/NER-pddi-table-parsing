                  MetoprololMetoprolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. In vitro and in vivo animal 
studies have shown that it has a preferential effect on beta1 adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in cardiac muscle. This 
preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher doses, metoprolol 
also inhibits beta2 adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in 
the bronchial and vascular musculature.
                  Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of 
metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at 
rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, 
(3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex 
orthostatic tachycardia.
                  Relative beta1 selectivity has been confirmed by the 
following: (1) In normal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts 
with the effect of nonselective (beta1 plus beta2) beta-blockers, which completely reverse the vasodilating 
effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV1 and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, 
propranolol at equivalent beta1-receptor blocking 
doses.
                  Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and only weak 
membrane-stabilizing activity. Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and 
has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma 
concentration. Animal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the 
sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction.
                  In controlled clinical studies, metoprolol has been shown to be an effective 
antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with 
thiazide-type diuretics, at dosages of 100 mg to 450 mg daily. In controlled, 
comparative, clinical studies, metoprolol has been shown to be as effective an 
antihypertensive agent as propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, 
and to be equally effective in supine and standing positions.
                  The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents has not 
been elucidated. However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) 
competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) 
adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output; (2) a central 
effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) 
suppression of renin activity.
                  
                  
                  PharmacokineticsIn man, absorption of metoprolol is rapid and complete. Plasma 
levels following oral administration, however, approximate 50% of levels 
following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass 
metabolism. 
                  Plasma levels achieved are highly variable after oral administration. Only a 
small fraction of the drug (about 12%) is bound to human serum albumin. 
Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R-and S-enantiomers. Less than 5% of an oral 
dose of metoprolol is recovered unchanged in the urine; the rest is excreted by 
the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no clinical significance. The 
systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure 
do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects. 
Consequently, no reduction in dosage is usually needed in patients with chronic 
renal failure.
                  In elderly subjects with clinically normal renal function, there are no 
significant differences in metoprolol pharmacokinetics compared to young 
subjects. 
                  Metoprolol is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in 
the liver. The oxidative metabolism of metoprolol is under genetic control with 
a major contribution of the polymorphic cytochrome P450 isoform 2D6 (CYP2D6). 
There are marked ethnic differences in the prevalence of the poor metabolizers 
(PM) phenotype. Approximately 7% of Caucasians and less than 1% of Asians are 
poor metabolizers. 
                  Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers exhibit several-fold higher plasma concentrations of 
metoprolol than extensive metabolizers with normal CYP2D6 activity. The 
elimination half-life of metoprolol is about 7.5 hours in poor metabolizers and 
2.8 hours in extensive metabolizers. However, the CYP2D6 dependent metabolism of 
metoprolol seems to have little or no effect on safety or tolerability of the 
drug. None of the metabolites of metoprolol contribute significantly to its 
beta-blocking effect.
                  
                  
                  PharmacodynamicsSignificant beta-blocking effect (as measured by reduction of 
exercise heart rate) occurs within one hour after oral administration and its 
duration is dose related. For example, a 50% reduction of the maximum registered 
effect after single oral doses of 20 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg occurred at 3.3, 5, 
and 6.4 hours, respectively, in normal subjects. After repeated oral dosages of 
100 mg twice daily, a significant reduction in exercise systolic blood pressure 
was evident at 12 hours.
                  There is a linear relationship between the log of plasma levels and reduction 
of exercise heart rate. However, antihypertensive activity does not appear to be 
related to plasma levels. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a 
given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to 
dose, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.
                  
                  
                  HydrochlorothiazideThiazides affect the renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte 
reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosage, all thiazides are approximately 
equal in their diuretic potency. Thiazides increase excretion of sodium and 
chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis causes a secondary 
loss of potassium.
                  The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. 
Thiazides do not affect normal blood pressure.
                  
                  
                  PharmacokineticsHydrochlorothiazide is rapidly absorbed, as indicated by peak 
plasma concentrations 1 to 2.5 hours after oral administration. Plasma levels of 
the drug are proportional to dose; the concentration in whole blood is 1.6 to 
1.8 times higher than in plasma. Thiazides are eliminated rapidly by the kidney. 
After oral administration of 25 mg to 100 mg doses, 72% to 97% of the dose is 
excreted in the urine, indicating dose-independent absorption. 
Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma in a biphasic fashion with a 
terminal half-life of 10 to 17 hours. Plasma protein binding is 67.9%. Plasma 
clearance is 15.9 to 30 L/hr; volume of distribution is 3.6 to 7.8 L/kg.
                  Gastrointestinal absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is enhanced when 
administered with food. Absorption is decreased in patients with congestive 
heart failure and the pharmacokinetics are considerably different in these 
patients.
                  
                  
                  PharmacodynamicsThe onset of action of thiazides occurs in 2 hours and the peak 
effect at about 4 hours. The action persists for approximately 6 to 12 
hours.
