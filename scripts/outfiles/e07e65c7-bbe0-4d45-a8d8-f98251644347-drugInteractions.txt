                        Patients with cardiovascular diseases and/or pulmonary diseases such as symptomatic, unstable, steroid-dependent asthma, and/or those who are receiving cardiovascular drugs such as beta blockers, may be at higher risk for  severe adverse reactions. These patients may also be more refractory to the normal allergy treatment regimen. Patients should be treated only if the benefit of treatment outweighs the risks.(1)
                           
Patients on beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing or treatment and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.
 See WARNINGS section regarding concurrent treatment with ACE inhibitors. 
Certain medications may lessen the skin test wheal and erythema responses elicited by allergens and histamine for varying time periods. Conventional antihistamines should be discontinued at least 5 days before skin testing. Long acting antihistamines should be discontinued for at least 3 weeks prior to skin testing.(17)  Topical steroids should be discontinued at the skin test site for at least 2-3 weeks before skin testing.(17, 18)
                           
Tricyclic antidepressants such as doxepin, should be withheld for at least 7 days before skin testing.(19)  Topical local anesthetics may suppress the flare responses and should be avoided on skin test sites.(20)
                           
When using other drugs in patients receiving allergenic extracts, always consult the product labeling of the other drugs to determine any possible interaction with use of allergenic extracts, and  specifically with stinging insect (Hymenoptera) venom extracts.
