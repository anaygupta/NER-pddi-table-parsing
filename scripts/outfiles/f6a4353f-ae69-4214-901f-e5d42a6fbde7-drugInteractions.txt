                        7.1 Anti-hypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides 
                     
                     
                        Alpha-2 agonists, as a class, may reduce blood pressure. Caution in using drugs such as beta-blockers, anti-hypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides is advised.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.2 CNS Depressants 
                     
                     
                        Although specific drug-drug interactions studies have not been conducted with MIRVASO topical gel, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anaesthetics) should be considered.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.3 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
                     
                     
                        Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension. Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines.
