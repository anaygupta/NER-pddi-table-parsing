                           Coumarin Anticoagulants: (7.1).
                           Bile Acid Resins: (7.2).
                           Cyclosporine: (7.3).
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Oral Anticoagulants
                     
                        Caution should be exercised when oral coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with Trilipix [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Bile Acid Resins
                     
                        Since bile acid resins may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take Trilipix at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a bile acid resin to avoid impeding its absorption.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Cyclosporine
                     
                        Because cyclosporine can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of drugs of the fibrate class including Trilipix, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to decline of renal function. The benefits and risks of using Trilipix with immunosuppressants and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed.
