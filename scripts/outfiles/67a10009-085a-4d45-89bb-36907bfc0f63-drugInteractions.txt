                                    Antiarrhythmic Drugs:
                                  LIDODERM should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Local Anesthetics:
                                  When LIDODERM is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered.
