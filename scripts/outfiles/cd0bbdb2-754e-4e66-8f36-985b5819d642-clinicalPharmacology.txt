                  Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension, USP, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrial thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect.
                  Following a single 150 mg IM dose of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension, USP, Medroxyprogesterone Acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. The levels then decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate following IM administration of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension, USP is approximately 50 days.
