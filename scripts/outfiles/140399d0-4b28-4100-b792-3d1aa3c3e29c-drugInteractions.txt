                  Topotecan is a substrate for both P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Inhibitors of these transporters increase the systemic exposure to oral topotecan. Avoid concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, azithromycin, captopril, carvedilol, clarithromycin, conivaptan, cyclosporine, diltiazem, dronedarone, erythromycin, felodipine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir, ritonavir, quercetin, quinidine, ranolazine, ticagrelor, verapamil) and BCRP inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, eltrombopag) with HYCAMTIN capsules [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
