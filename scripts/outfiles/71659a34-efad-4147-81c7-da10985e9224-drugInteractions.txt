                     7.1 Oral Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Inhibitors
                     
                        Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor orally and BETOPTIC S® Ophthalmic Suspension 0.25% should be observed for a potential additive effect either on the intraocular pressure or on the known systemic effects of beta blockade.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs
                     
                        Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta–adrenergic receptor inhibitor is administered to patients receivingcatecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or bradycardia which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Concomitant Adrenergic Psychotropic Drugs
                     
                        Betaxolol is an adrenergic receptor inhibitor; therefore, caution should be exercised in patients using concomitant adrenergic psychotropic drugs.
