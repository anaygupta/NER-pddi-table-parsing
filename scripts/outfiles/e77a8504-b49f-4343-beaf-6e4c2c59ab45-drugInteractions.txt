                              •Inhibitors of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) may increase rosiglitazone levels. (7.1) 
                           
                              •Inducers of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may decrease rosiglitazone levels. (7.1)
                           
                              •Cationic drugs eliminated by renal tubular secretion; use with caution. (7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450
                     
                        An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) may increase the AUC of rosiglitazone and an inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may decrease the AUC of rosiglitazone. Therefore, if an inhibitor or an inducer of CYP2C8 is started or stopped during treatment with rosiglitazone, changes in diabetes treatment may be needed based upon clinical response.

                     7.2 Cationic Drugs
                     
                        Although drug interactions for metformin with cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, and vancomycin) remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of AVANDAMET and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system.

                     7.3 Drugs That Produce Hyperglycemia
                     
                        When drugs that produce hyperglycemia, which may lead to loss of glycemic control, are administered to a patient receiving AVANDAMET, the patient should be closely observed to maintain adequate glycemic control.
