                  When administered intravenously, these solutions provide a source
                            of water and potassium chloride with carbohydrate (dextrose) and sodium
                            chloride. See

                            for specific concentrations of these various solutions.
                  Solutions containing carbohydrate in the form of dextrose restore
                            blood glucose levels and provide calories. Carbohydrate in the form of
                            dextrose may aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a
                            protein-sparing action. Dextrose injected parenterally undergoes
                            oxidation to carbon dioxide and water.
                  Intravenous solutions containing potassium chloride are
                            particularly intended to provide needed potassium cation
                            (K+). Potassium is the chief cation of body cells (160
                            mEq/liter of intracellular water). It is found in low concentration in
                            plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter in a healthy
                            adult). Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance.
                            Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the
                            urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the
                            perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during
                            fasting or in patients on a potassium-free diet, potassium loss from the
                            body continues resulting in potassium depletion. A deficiency of either
                            potassium or chloride will lead to a deficit of the other.
                  Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium
                                (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Sodium
                                (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid
                            and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte
                            disturbances. Chloride (Cl−) has an integral role in
                            buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the
                            red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium
                                (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) are largely
                            under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake
                            and output.
                  Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and
                            accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal
                            adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to
                            1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine
                            production).
                  Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms.
                            Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of
                            electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays
                            a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.
