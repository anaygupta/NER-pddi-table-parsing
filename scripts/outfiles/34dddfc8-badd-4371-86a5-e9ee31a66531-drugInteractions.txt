                                    Catecholamine-depleting drugs:
                                  Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Observe patients treated with metoprolol tartrate plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. In addition, possibly significant hypertension may theoretically occur up to 14 days following discontinuation of the concomitant administration with an irreversible MAO inhibitor.
 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Digitalis glycosides and beta blockers:
                                  Both digitalis glycosides and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and PR interval.
 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Calcium channel blockers:
                                  Concomitant administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with a calcium channel blocker may produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility because of negative chronotropic and inotropic effects.
 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    CYP2D6 Inhibitors:
                                  Potent inhibitors of the CYP2D6 enzyme may increase the plasma concentration of metoprolol tartrate which would mimic the pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (see 
  
                                    Pharmacokinetics section
                                 ). Increase in plasma concentrations of metoprolol would decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol. Known clinically significant potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 are antidepressants such as fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion, chomipramine, and desipramine; antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and thioridazine; antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propafenone; antiretrovirals such as ritonavir; antihistamines such as diphenhydramine; antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or quinidine; antifungals such as terbinafine.
 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Hydralazine:
                                  Concomitant administration of hydralazine may inhibit presystemic metablism of metoprolol leading to increased concentrations of metoprolol.
 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Alpha-adrenergic agents: 
                                 Antihypertensive effect of alpha-adrenergic blockers such as guanethidine, betanidine, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa or clonidine may be potentiated by beta-blockers including metoprolol tartrate. Beta-adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the postural hypotensive effect of the first dose of prazosin, probably by preventing reflex tachycardia. On the contrary, beta adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the hypertensive response to withdrawal of clonidine in patients receiving concomitant clonidine and beta-adrenergic blocker. If a patient is treated with clonidine and metoprolol tartrate concurrently, and clonidine treatment is to be discontinued, stop metoprolol tartrate several days before clonidine is withdrawn. Rebound hypertension that can follow withdrawal of clonidine may be increased in patients receiving concurrent beta-blocker treatment.
 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Ergot alkaloid:
                                  Concomitant administration with beta-blockers may enhance the vasoconstrictive action of ergot alkaloids.
 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Dipyridamole:
                                  In general, administration of a beta-blocker should be withheld before diphyridamole testing, with careful monitoring of heart rate following the dipyridamole injection.
