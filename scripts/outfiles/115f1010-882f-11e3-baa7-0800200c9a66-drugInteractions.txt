                           Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage (7.1)
                           Avoid coadministration of tetracyclines with penicillin (7.2)
                           Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, bismuth subsalicylate and iron-containing preparations (7.3)
                           Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective (7.4)
                           Barbiturates, carbamazepine and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline (7.5)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Anticoagulant Drugs
                     
                        Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Penicillin
                     
                        Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	Antacids and Iron Preparations
                     
                        Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, bismuth subsalicylate, and iron-containing preparations.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4	Oral Contraceptives
                     
                        Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5	Barbiturates and Anti-Epileptics
                     
                        Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6	Penthrane®
                     
                     
                        The concurrent use of tetracycline and Penthrane® (methoxyflurane) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.

                        False elevations of urinary catecholamines may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test.
