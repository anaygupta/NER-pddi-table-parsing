                     7.1  Transporter-Based Drug-Drug Interactions
                     
                        MultiHance and other drugs may compete for the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (MOAT also referred to as MRP2 or ABCC2). Therefore MultiHance may prolong the systemic exposure of drugs such as cisplatin, anthracyclines (e.g. doxorubicin, daunorubicin), vinca alkaloids (e.g. vincristine), methotrexate, etoposide, tamoxifen, and paclitaxel. In particular, consider the potential for prolonged drug exposure in patients with decreased MOAT activity (e.g. Dubin Johnson syndrome).
