                  Atracurium besylate is a
                                                  nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant.
                                                  Nondepolarizing agents antagonize the
                                                  neurotransmitter action of acetylcholine by
                                                  binding competitively with cholinergic receptor
                                                  sites on the motor end-plate. This antagonism is
                                                  inhibited, and neuromuscular block reversed, by
                                                  acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as
                                                  neostigmine, edrophonium, and
                                                  pyridostigmine.
                  Atracurium can be used most
                                                  advantageously if muscle twitch response to
                                                  peripheral nerve stimulation is monitored to
                                                  assess degree of muscle relaxation.
                  The duration of neuromuscular block
                                                  produced by atracurium is approximately one-third
                                                  to    one-half the duration of
                                                  block by d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and
                                                  pancuronium at initially equipotent doses. As with
                                                  other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, the
                                                  time to onset of paralysis decreases and the
                                                  duration of maximum effect increases with
                                                  increasing atracurium doses.
                  The ED95 (dose required to
                                                  produce 95% suppression of the muscle twitch
                                                  response with balanced anesthesia) has averaged
                                                  0.23 mg/kg (0.11 to 0.26 mg/kg in various
                                                  studies). An initial atracurium dose of 0.4 to 0.5
                                                  mg/kg generally produces maximum neuromuscular
                                                  block within 3 to 5 minutes of injection,
                                                  with good or excellent intubation conditions
                                                  within 2 to 2.5 minutes in most patients. Recovery
                                                  from neuromuscular block (under balanced
                                                  anesthesia) can be expected to begin approximately
                                                  20 to 35 minutes after injection. Under balanced
                                                  anesthesia, recovery to 25% of control is
                                                  achieved approximately 35 to 45 minutes after
                                                  injection, and recovery is usually 95%
                                                  complete approximately 60 to 70 minutes after
                                                  injection. The neuromuscular blocking action of
                                                  atracurium is enhanced in the presence of potent
                                                  inhalation anesthetics. Isoflurane and enflurane
                                                  increase the potency of atracurium and prolong
                                                  neuromuscular block by approximately 35%;
                                                  however, halothane’s potentiating effect
                                                  (approximately 20%) is marginal (see 
                        
                           
                              
                                 DOSAGE AND
                                                  ADMINISTRATION
                              
                           
                        
                     ).
                  Repeated administration of maintenance
                                                  doses of atracurium has no cumulative effect on
                                                  the duration of neuromuscular block if recovery is
                                                  allowed to begin prior to repeat dosing. Moreover,
                                                  the time needed to recover from repeat doses does
                                                  not change with additional doses. Repeat doses can
                                                  therefore be administered at relatively regular
                                                  intervals with predictable results. After an
                                                  initial dose of 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg under balanced
                                                  anesthesia, the first maintenance dose (suggested
                                                  maintenance dose is 0.08 to 0.10 mg/kg) is
                                                  generally required within 20 to 45 minutes, and
                                                  subsequent maintenance doses are usually required
                                                  at approximately 15 to 25 minute
                                                  intervals.
                  Once recovery from atracurium’s
                                                  neuromuscular blocking effects begins, it proceeds
                                                  more rapidly than recovery from d-tubocurarine,
                                                  metocurine, and pancuronium. Regardless of the
                                                  atracurium dose, the time from start of recovery
                                                  (from complete block) to complete (95%)
                                                  recovery is approximately 30 minutes under
                                                  balanced anesthesia, and approximately 40 minutes
                                                  under halothane, enflurane or isoflurane. Repeated
                                                  doses have no cumulative effect on recovery
                                                  rate.
                  Reversal of neuromuscular block
                                                  produced by atracurium can be achieved with an
                                                  anti-cholinesterase agent such as neostigmine,
                                                  edrophonium, or pyridostigmine, in conjunction
                                                  with an anticholinergic agent such as atropine or
                                                  glycopyrrolate. Under balanced anesthesia,
                                                  reversal can usually be attempted approximately 20
                                                  to 35 minutes after an initial atracurium besylate
                                                  dose of 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg, or approximately 10 to
                                                  30 minutes after a 0.08 to 0.10 mg/kg maintenance
                                                  dose, when recovery of muscle twitch has started.
                                                  Complete reversal is usually attained within 8 to
                                                  10 minutes of the administration of reversing
                                                  agents. Rare instances of breathing difficulties,
                                                  possibly related to incomplete reversal, have been
                                                  reported following attempted pharmacologic
                                                  antagonism of atracurium-induced neuromuscular
                                                  block. As with other agents in this class, the
                                                  tendency for residual neuromuscular block is
                                                  increased if reversal is attempted at deep levels
                                                  of block or if inadequate doses of reversal agents
                                                  are employed.
                  The pharmacokinetics of atracurium in
                                                  humans are essentially linear within the 0.3 to
                                                  0.6 mg/kg dose range. The elimination half-life is
                                                  approximately 20 minutes. THE DURATION OF

                                                  THE ABSENCE OF RENAL FUNCTION. This is consistent
                                                  with the results of 
                        in
                                                  vitro
                      studies which have shown
                                                  that atracurium is inactivated in plasma via two
                                                  nonoxidative pathways: ester hydrolysis, catalyzed
                                                  by nonspecific esterases; and Hofmann elimination,
                                                  a nonenzymatic chemical process which occurs at
                                                  physiological pH. Some placental transfer occurs
                                                  in humans.
                  Radiolabel studies demonstrated that
                                                  atracurium undergoes extensive degradation in
                                                  cats, and that neither kidney nor liver plays a
                                                  major role in this elimination. Biliary and
                                                  urinary excretion were the major routes of
                                                  excretion of radioactivity (totaling >90%
                                                  of the labeled dose within 7 hours of dosing), of
                                                  which atracurium represented only a minor
                                                  fraction. The metabolites in bile and urine were
                                                  similar, including products of Hofmann elimination
                                                  and ester hydrolysis.
                  Elderly patients may have slightly
                                                  altered pharmacokinetic parameters compared to
                                                  younger patients, with a slightly decreased total
                                                  plasma clearance which is offset by a
                                                  corresponding increase in volume of distribution.
                                                  The net effect is that there has been no
                                                  significant difference in clinical duration and
                                                  recovery from neuromuscular block observed between
                                                  elderly and younger patients receiving atracurium
                                                  besylate.
                  Atracurium is a less potent histamine
                                                  releaser than d-tubocurarine or metocurine.
                                                  Histamine release is minimal with initial
                                                  atracurium besylate doses up to 0.5 mg/kg, and
                                                  hemodynamic changes are minimal within the
                                                  recommended dose range. A moderate histamine
                                                  release and significant falls in blood pressure
                                                  have been seen following 0.6 mg/kg of atracurium
                                                  besylate. The histamine and hemodynamic responses
                                                  were poorly correlated. The effects were generally
                                                  short-lived and manageable, but the possibility of
                                                  substantial histamine release in sensitive
                                                  individuals or in patients in whom substantial
                                                  histamine release would be especially hazardous
                                                  (e.g., patients with significant cardiovascular
                                                  disease) must be considered.
                  It is not known whether the prior use
                                                  of other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking
                                                  agents has any effect on the activity of
                                                  atracurium. The prior use of succinylcholine
                                                  decreases by approximately 2 to 3 minutes the time
                                                  to maximum block induced by atracurium besylate,
                                                  and may increase the depth of block. Atracurium
                                                  should be administered only after a patient
                                                  recovers from succinylcholine-induced
                                                  neuromuscular block.
