                  A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring.

                  Following are some of the examples:

                  
                     
                        Drugs That May Increase the Blood-Glucose-Lowering Effect of HUMALOG and Susceptibility to Hypoglycemia: Oral antidiabetic agents, salicylates, sulfonamide antibiotics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, fluoxetine, pramlintide, disopyramide, fibrates, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, and somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide).

                     
                        Drugs That May Reduce the Blood-Glucose-Lowering Effect of HUMALOG: corticosteroids, isoniazid, niacin, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), somatropin, atypical antipsychotics, glucagon, protease inhibitors, and thyroid hormones.

                     
                        Drugs That May Increase or Reduce the Blood-Glucose-Lowering Effect of HUMALOG: beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia.

                     
                        Drugs That May Reduce the Signs of Hypoglycemia: beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine.

                  
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism and may necessitate insulin dose adjustment. (7)

                           The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine). (7)
