                           Parenteral Fluid Compatibility
                           
                              The addition of sodium bicarbonate to parenteral solutions containing calcium should be avoided, except where compatibility has been previously established. Precipitation or haze may result from sodium bicarbonate-calcium admixtures. Should this occur, such a solution should be immediately discarded.
                              Caution should be observed when giving parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.
                              
                              Increased half-lives and duration of action of quinidine, amphetamines, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine may occur with urinary alkalinization by sodium bicarbonate.
                              Sodium bicarbonate, by producing an alkaline urine, increases the renal clearance of tetracyclines, especially doxycycline.
