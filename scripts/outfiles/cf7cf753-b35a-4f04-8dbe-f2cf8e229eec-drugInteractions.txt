               In vitro studies indicate that ribavirin does not inhibit CYP450 enzymes.

                  

                  Nucleoside Analogues

                  In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine.
In vitro, didanosine or its active metabolite (dideoxyadenosine 5'triphosphate) is increased when didanosine is cowith ribavirin, which could cause or worsen clinical toxicities (seePRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

                  

                  Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450

                  There was no effect on the pharmacokinetics of representative drugs metabolized by CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19, CYP 2D6 or CYP 3A4.
Treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy subjects was associated with an inhibition of P450 1A2 and a 25% increase in theophylline AUC (seePRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).
