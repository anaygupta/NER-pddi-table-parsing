                  The effectiveness of benzoyl peroxide in the treatment of acne vulgaris is primarily attributable to its antibacterial activity, especially with respect to Propionibacterium acnes, the predominant organism in sebaceous follicles and comedones.1,2 The antibacterial activity of this compound is presumably due to the release of active or free-radical oxygen capable of oxidizing bacterial proteins.3 In acne patients treated topically with benzoyl peroxide, resolution of the acne usually coincides with reduction in the levels of P. acnes and free fatty acids (FFA). Mild desquamation is another observed action of topically applied benzoyl peroxide and may also play a role in the drugâ€™s effectiveness in acne.3 Studies also indicate that topical benzoyl peroxide may exert a se-bostatic effect with a resultant reduction of skin surface lipids.4,5
                  
                  Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin, where it is metabolized to benzoic acid and then excreted as benzoate in the urine.6
