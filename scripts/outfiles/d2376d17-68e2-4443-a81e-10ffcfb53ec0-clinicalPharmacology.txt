                        The pharmacokinetics of acyclovir after intravenous administration have been evaluated in adult patients with normal renal function during Phase 1/2 studies after single doses ranging from 0.5 to 15 mg/kg and after multiple doses ranging from 2.5 to 15 mg/kg every 8 hours.  Proportionality between dose and plasma levels is seen after single doses or at steady-state after multiple dosing.  Average steady-state peak and trough concentrations from 1-hour infusions administered every 8 hours are given in Table 1.

Concentrations achieved in the cerebrospinal fluid are approximately 50% of plasma values.  Plasma protein binding is relatively low (9% to 33%) and drug interactions involving binding site displacement are not anticipated.
                        Renal excretion of unchanged drug is the major route of acyclovir elimination accounting for 62% to 91% of the dose.  The only major urinary metabolite detected is 9-carboxymethoxymethylguanine accounting for up to 14.1% of the dose in patients with normal renal function.
                        The half-life and total body clearance of acyclovir are dependent on renal function as shown in Table 2.

                        Acyclovir was administered at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg to 6 adult patients with severe renal failure.  The peak and trough plasma levels during the 47 hours preceding hemodialysis were 8.5 mcg/mL and 0.7 mcg/mL, respectively.

                        Acyclovir pharmacokinetics were determined in 16 pediatric patients with normal renal function ranging in age from 3 months to 16 years at doses of approximately 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg every 8 hours (Table 3).  Concentrations achieved at these regimens are similar to those in adults receiving 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 8 hours, respectively (Table 1).  Acyclovir pharmacokinetics were determined in 12 patients ranging in age from birth to 3 months at doses of 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 15 mg/kg every 8 hours (Table 3).

                        Acyclovir plasma concentrations are higher in geriatric patients compared to younger adults, in part due to age-related changes in renal function.  Dosage reduction may be required in geriatric patients with underlying renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS:

                        Coadministration of probenecid with acyclovir has been shown to increase the mean half-life and the area under the concentration-time curve.  Urinary excretion and renal clearance were correspondingly reduced.
