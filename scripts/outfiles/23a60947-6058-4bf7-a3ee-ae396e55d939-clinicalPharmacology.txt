Central Nervous System
                  Oxycodone is a semisynthetic pure opioid agonist whose principal 
therapeutic action is analgesia. Other pharmacological effects of oxycodone 
include anxiolysis, euphoria and feelings of relaxation. These effects are 
mediated by receptors (notably μ and κ) in the central nervous system for 
endogenous opioid-like compounds such as endorphins and enkephalins. Oxycodone 
produces respiratory depression through direct activity at respiratory centers 
in the brain stem and depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the center 
of the medulla.
                  Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) works by inhibiting the body’s production of 
prostaglandins, including prostaglandins involved in inflammation. 
Prostaglandins cause pain sensations by stimulating muscle contractions and 
dilating blood vessels throughout the body. In the CNS, aspirin works on the 
hypothalamus heat-regulating center to reduce fever, however, other mechanisms 
may be involved.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                     
Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle
                  Oxycodone reduces motility by increasing smooth muscle tone in 
the stomach and duodenum. In the small intestine, digestion of food is delayed 
by decreases in propulsive contractions. Other opioid effects include 
contraction of biliary tract smooth muscle, spasm of the Sphincter of Oddi, 
increased ureteral and bladder sphincter tone, and a reduction in uterine tone. 

                  Aspirin can produce gastrointestinal injury (lesions, ulcers) through a 
mechanism that is not yet completely understood, but may involve a reduction in 
eicosanoid synthesis by the gastric mucosa. Decreased production of 
prostaglandins may compromise the defenses of the gastric mucosa and the 
activity of substances involved in tissue repair and ulcer healing. 
                  
                  
                  
                  
                     
Cardiovascular System
                  Oxycodone may produce a release of histamine and may be 
associated with orthostatic hypotension, and other symptoms, such as pruritus, 
flushing, red eyes, and sweating.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                     
Platelet Aggregation
                  Aspirin affects platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting 
prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase. This effect lasts for the life of the platelet 
and prevents the formation of the platelet aggregating factor thromboxane A2. 
Nonacetylated salicylates do not inhibit this enzyme and have no effect on 
platelet aggregation. At somewhat higher doses, aspirin reversibly inhibits the 
formation of prostaglandin 12 (prostacyclin), which is an arterial vasodilator 
and inhibits platelet aggregation.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                     
Pharmacokinetics
                  Absorption and Distribution
                  The mean absolute oral bioavailability of oxycodone in cancer patients was 
reported to be about 87%. Oxycodone has been shown to be 45% bound to human 
plasma proteins in vitro. The volume of distribution 
after intravenous administration is 211.9 ±186.6 L. 
                  Aspirin is hydrolyzed primarily to salicylic acid in the gut wall and during 
first-pass metabolism through the liver. Salicylic acid is absorbed rapidly from 
the stomach, but most of the absorption occurs in the proximal small intestine. 
Following absorption, salicylate is distributed to most body tissues and fluids, 
including fetal tissues, breast milk, and the CNS. High concentrations are found 
in the liver and kidneys. Salicylate is variably bound to serum proteins, 
particularly albumin.
                  Metabolism and Elimination
                  A high portion of oxycodone is N-dealkylated to noroxycodone during 
first-pass metabolism. Oxymorphone, is formed by the O-demethylation of 
oxycodone. The metabolism of oxycodone to oxymorphone is catalyzed by CYP2D6. 
Free and conjugated noroxycodone, free and conjugated oxycodone, and oxymorphone 
are excreted in human urine following a single oral dose of oxycodone. 
Approximately 8% to 14% of the dose is excreted as free oxycodone over 24 hours 
after administration. Following a single, oral dose of oxycodone, the mean ± SD 
elimination half-life is 3.51 ± 1.43 hours.
                  The biotransformation of aspirin occurs primarily in the liver by the 
microsomal enzyme system. With a plasma half-life of approximately 15 minutes, 
aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed to salicylate. At low doses, salicylate 
elimination follows first-order kinetics. The plasma half-life of salicylate is 
approximately 2 to 3 hours.
                  Approximately 10% of aspirin is excreted as unchanged salicylate in the 
urine. The major metabolites excreted in the urine are salicyluric acid (75%), 
salicyl phenolic glucuronide (10%), salicyl acyl glucuronide (5%), and gentisic 
and gentisuric acid (less than 1%) each. Eighty to 100% of a single dose is 
excreted in the urine within 24 to 72 hours.
