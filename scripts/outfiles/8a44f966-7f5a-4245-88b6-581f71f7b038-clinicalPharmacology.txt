                     General
                     
                        When technetium Tc99m pertechnetate is added to exametazime in the presence of stannous reductant, a lipophilic technetium Tc99m complex is formed. This lipophilic complex is the active moiety. It converts at approximately 12%/hour to less lipophilic species. When the secondary complex is separated from the lipophilic species, it is unable to cross the blood-brain-barrier. The useful life of the reconstituted agent is limited to 30 minutes. The in vitro addition of methylene blue to the Tc99m-exametazime will stabilize the complex for 4-6 hours. Methylene blue may be added to Tc99m for cerebral imaging. Methylene blue should not be used in the preparation of Tc99m-exametazime labeled leukocytes. (See section on Preparation and Handling).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Studies in normal volunteers have shown that the technetium Tc99m complex of the RR,SS(d,l) diastereoisomer of exametazime is rapidly cleared from the blood after intravenous injection. Uptake in the brain reaches a maximum of 3.5-7.0% of the injected dose within one minute of injection. Up to 15% of the activity is eliminated from the brain by 2 minutes post injection, after which little activity is lost for the following 24 hours except by physical decay of technetium Tc99m. The activity not associated with the brain is widely distributed throughout the body, particularly in muscle and soft tissue. About 30% of the injected dose is found in the gastrointestinal tract immediately after injection and about 50% of this is excreted through the intestinal tract over 48 hours. Also, about 40% of the injected dose is excreted through the kidneys and urine over the 48 hours after injection.
                        The use of methylene blue for stabilization prior to injection does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetic handling or distribution of Tc99m exametazime.

                        The lipophilic Tc99m exametazime complex (that is not stabilized by methylene blue) is taken up by leukocytes, and selectively retained in neutrophils. Label elution rate is up to 10% in the first hour.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Tc99m-labeled leukocyte: Based upon in vivo recovery and very low lung and liver uptake, the labeled leukocytes are still functional. Following reinjection of the Tc99m labeled leukocytes the circulating granulocyte activity as a percentage of labeled granulocyte activity at 40 minutes after injection gave a mean of 37% (range 10-47%).
                        During the first hour following injection of Tc99m labeled leukocytes, activity is seen in the lungs, liver, spleen, blood pool, bone marrow and the bladder. The kidneys (parenchyma and/or renal pelvis) and gall bladder may also be visualized. Over the first 1-6 hours, the Tc99m is visualized in the bowel. At 24 hours post-injection substantial colonic activity is seen. The normal areas visualized in earlier scans are still visible.
