                  Reduced absorption of folic acid and digoxin have been reported 
when those agents were administered concomitantly with sulfasalazine.
                  
                  Drug/Laboratory Test InteractionsThe presence of sulfasalazine or its metabolites in body fluids 
has not been reported to interfere with laboratory test procedures.
                  
                  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
FertilityTwo-year oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in male and 
female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. Sulfasalazine was tested at 84 (496 mg/m²), 
168 (991 mg/m²), and 337.5 (1991 mg/m²) mg/kg/day doses in rats. A statistically 
significant increase in the incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell 
papillomas was observed in male rats. In female rats, two (4%) of the 337.5 
mg/kg rats had transitional cell papilloma of the kidney. The increased 
incidence of neoplasms in the urinary bladder and kidney of rats was also 
associated with an increase in the renal calculi formation and hyperplasia of 
transitional cell epithelium. For the mouse study, sulfasalazine was tested at 
675 (2025 mg/m²), 1350 (4050 mg/m²), and 2700 (8100 mg/m²) mg/kg/day. The 
incidence of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma in male and female mice was 
significantly greater than the control at all doses tested.
                  Sulfasalazine did not show mutagenicity in the bacterial reverse mutation 
assay (Ames test) and in L51784 mouse lymphoma cell assay at the HGPRT gene. 
However, sulfasalazine showed equivocal mutagenic response in the micronucleus 
assay of mouse and rat bone marrow and mouse peripheral RBC and in the sister 
chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberration, and micronucleus assays in 
lymphocytes obtained from humans.
                  Impairment of male fertility was observed in reproductive studies performed 
in rats at a dose of 800 mg/kg/day (4800 mg/m²). Oligospermia and infertility 
have been described in men treated with sulfasalazine. Withdrawal of the drug 
appears to reverse these effects.
