                  Diagnostically (for skin testing) the allergen combines with IgE antibodies fixed to mast cells in the skin.3Â This complexing causes an increase in cellular permeability and degranulation of the mast cells releasing chemical mediators.  These mediators (such as histamine) are responsible for a local inflammatory response of wheal and erythema typical of a positive skin test reaction and also, the symptoms commonly associated with allergic disease.  The more mediator release, the larger the reaction (wheal and erythema).  
                  Treatment consists of the subcutaneous injection of gradually increasing doses of the allergens to which the patient is allergic.  It has been demonstrated that this method of treatment induces an increased tolerance to the allergens responsible for the symptoms on subsequent exposure.  Although the exact relationships between allergen, skin sensitizing antibody (IgE) and the blocking antibody (IgG) have not been precisely established, clinically confirmed immunological studies have adduced evidence of the efficacy of hyposensitization therapy.
                  Numerous controlled studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy with cat, dust mites and some pollen extracts.4  Nevertheless, responses are not uniform but variable, and in a few studies, the majority of the patients reported no appreciable improvement.
