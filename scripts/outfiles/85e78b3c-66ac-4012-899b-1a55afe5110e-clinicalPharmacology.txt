                     12.1 Mechanism of Action 
                     
                         The pancreatic enzymes in CREON catalyze the hydrolysis of fats to monoglyceride, glycerol and free fatty acids, proteins into peptides and amino acids, and starches into dextrins and short chain sugars such as maltose and maltriose in the duodenum and proximal small intestine, thereby acting like digestive enzymes physiologically secreted by the pancreas. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics 
                     
                         The pancreatic enzymes in CREON are enteric-coated to minimize destruction or inactivation in gastric acid. CREON is designed to release most of the enzymes in vivo at an approximate pH of 5.5 or greater. Pancreatic enzymes are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in appreciable amounts.
