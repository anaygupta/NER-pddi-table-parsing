                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Levocetirizine, the active enantiomer of cetirizine, is an anti-histamine; its principal effects are mediated via selective inhibition of H1 receptors.  The antihistaminic activity of levocetirizine has been documented in a variety of animal and human models.  In vitro binding studies revealed that levocetirizine has an affinity for the human H1-receptor 2-fold higher than that of cetirizine (Ki = 3 nmol/L vs. 6 nmol/L, respectively.  The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2	Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Studies in adult healthy subjects showed that levocetirizine at doses of 2.5 mg and 5 mg inhibited the skin wheal and flare caused by the intradermal injection of histamine.  In contrast, dextrocetirizine exhibited no clear change in the inhibition of the wheal and flare reaction. Levocetirizine at a dose of 5 mg inhibited the wheal and flare caused by intradermal injection of histamine in 14 pediatric subjects (aged 6 to 11 years) and the activity persisted for at least 24 hours.  The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown.
                         A QT/QTc study using a single dose of 30 mg of levocetirizine did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. While a single dose of levocetirizine had no effect, the effects of levocetirizine may not be at steady state following single dose. The effect of levocetirizine on the QTc interval following multiple dose administration is unknown. Levocetirizine is not expected to have QT/QTc effects because of the results of QTc studies with cetirizine and the long post-marketing history of cetirizine without reports of QT prolongation.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3  Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Levocetirizine exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range in adult healthy subjects.
                        
                           
                              Absorption
                              
Levocetirizine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration.  In adults, peak plasma concentrations are achieved 0.9 hour after administration of the oral tablet.  The accumulation ratio following daily oral administration is 1.12 with steady state achieved after 2 days.  Peak concentrations are typically 270 ng/mL and 308 ng/mL following a single and a repeated 5 mg once daily dose, respectively.  Food had no effect on the extent of exposure (AUC) of the levocetirizine tablet, but Tmax was delayed by about 1.25 hours and Cmax was decreased by about 36% after administration with a high fat meal; therefore, levocetirizine can be administered with or without food.

                           
                           
                              Distribution
                              
The mean plasma protein binding of levocetirizine in vitro ranged from 91 to 92%, independent of concentration in the range of 90 to 5000 ng/mL, which includes the therapeutic plasma levels observed. Following oral dosing, the average apparent volume of distribution is approximately 0.4 L/kg, representative of distribution in total body water.
                        
                        
                           
                              Metabolism
                              
The extent of metabolism of levocetirizine in humans is less than 14% of the dose and therefore differences resulting from genetic polymorphism or concomitant intake of hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme inhibitors are expected to be negligible.  Metabolic pathways include aromatic oxidation, N- and O-dealkylation, and taurine conjugation.  Dealkylation pathways are primarily mediated by CYP 3A4 while aromatic oxidation involves multiple and/or unidentified CYP isoforms.
                        
                        
                           
                              Elimination
                              
The plasma half-life in adult healthy subjects was about 8 to 9 hours after administration of oral tablets and the mean oral total body clearance for levocetirizine was approximately 0.63 mL/kg/min. The major route of excretion of levocetirizine and its metabolites is via urine, accounting for a mean of 85.4% of the dose. Excretion via feces accounts for only 12.9% of the dose. Levocetirizine is excreted both by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Renal clearance of levocetirizine correlates with that of creatinine clearance. In patients with renal impairment the clearance of levocetirizine is reduced [see

                              Drug Interaction Studies
                              

                              In vitro data on metabolite interaction indicate that levocetirizine is unlikely to produce, or be subject to metabolic interactions.  Levocetirizine at concentrations well above Cmax level achieved within the therapeutic dose ranges is not an inhibitor of CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2A1, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4, and is not an inducer of UGT1A or CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2C9 and 3A4.

                              
No formal in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed with levocetirizine. Studies have been performed with the racemic cetirizine [see

                              Pediatric Patients
                              
Data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic study with oral administration of a single dose of 5 mg levocetirizine in 14 children age 6 to 11 years with body weight ranging between 20 and 40 kg show that Cmax and AUC values are about 2-fold greater than that reported in healthy adult subjects in a cross-study comparison. The mean Cmax was 450 ng/mL, occurring at a mean time of 1.2 hours, weight-normalized, total body clearance was 30% greater, and the elimination half-life 24% shorter in this pediatric population than in adults.
Dedicated pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age. 

                              Pharmacokinetic information in pediatric patients (age 1 to 5 years) is approved for UCB Inc.’s levocetirizine dihydrochloride drug product labeing. However, due to UCB Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights; this drug product is not labeled for such use in those pediatric patients.
                           
                        
                        
                           
                              Geriatric Patients
                              
Limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly subjects. Following once daily repeat oral administration of 30 mg levocetirizine for 6 days in 9 elderly subjects (65 to 74 years of age), the total body clearance was approximately 33% lower compared to that in younger adults. The disposition of racemic cetirizine has been shown to be dependent on renal function rather than on age. This finding would also be applicable for levocetirizine, as levocetirizine and cetirizine are both predominantly excreted in urine. Therefore, the levocetirizine dihydrochloride dose should be adjusted in accordance with renal function in elderly patients [see 
                                 Dosage and Administration
                                 (2)
                              ].
                        
                        
                           
                              Gender
                              
Pharmacokinetic results for 77 patients (40 men, 37 women) were evaluated for potential effect of gender.  The half-life was slightly shorter in women (7.08 ± 1.72 hr) than in men (8.62 ± 1.84 hr); however, the body weight-adjusted oral clearance in women (0.67 ± 0.16 mL/min/kg) appears to be comparable to that in men (0.59 ± 0.12 mL/min/kg).  The same daily doses and dosing intervals are applicable for men and women with normal renal function.
                        
                        
                           
                              Race
                              
The effect of race on levocetirizine has not been studied.  As levocetirizine is primarily renally excreted, and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic characteristics of levocetirizine are not expected to be different across races.  No race-related differences in the kinetics of racemic cetirizine have been observed.
                        
                        
                           
                              Renal Impairment
                              
Levocetirizine exposure (AUC) exhibited 1.8-, 3.2-, 4.3-, and 5.7-fold increase in mild, moderate, severe, renal impaired, and end-stage renal disease patients, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. The corresponding increases of half-life estimates were 1.4-, 2.0-, 2.9-, and 4-fold, respectively.

                              
The total body clearance of levocetirizine after oral dosing was correlated to the creatinine clearance and was progressively reduced based on severity of renal impairment.  Therefore, it is recommended to adjust the dose and dosing intervals of levocetirizine based on creatinine clearance in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment.  In end-stage renal disease patients (CLCR < 10 mL/min) levocetirizine is contraindicated.  The amount of levocetirizine removed during a standard 4 hour hemodialysis procedure was <10%.

                              
The dosage of levocetirizine dihydrochloride should be reduced in patients with mild renal impairment. Both the dosage and frequency of administration should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment [see 
                                 Dosage and Administration
                                 (2)
                              ].
                        
                        
                           
                              Hepatic Impairment
                              
Levocetirizine dihydrochloride  has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. The non-renal clearance (indicative of hepatic contribution) was found to constitute about 28% of the total body clearance in healthy adult subjects after oral administration.

                              
As levocetirizine is mainly excreted unchanged by the kidney, it is unlikely that the clearance of levocetirizine is significantly decreased in patients with solely hepatic impairment [see 
                                 Dosage and Administration
