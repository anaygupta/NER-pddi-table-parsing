                  Pomalidomide is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A.  Pomalidomide is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp).
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Avoid the use of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors unless medically necessary (2.3, 7.1, 12.3).
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Drugs That May Increase Pomalidomide Plasma Concentrations
                     
                        
                           CYP1A2 inhibitors: Pomalidomide exposure is increased when POMALYST is co-administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor (fluvoxamine) in the presence of a strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor (ketoconazole). Ketoconazole in the absence of a CYP1A2 inhibitor does not increase pomalidomide exposure. Avoid co-administration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin and fluvoxamine) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If it is medically necessary to co-administer strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 in the presence of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp, POMALYST dose should be reduced by 50%.
                        The effect of a CYP1A2 inhibitor in the absence of a co-administered CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor has not been studied. Monitor for toxicities if CYP1A2 inhibitors are to be co-administered in the absence of a co-administered CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor, and reduce dose if needed. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Drugs That May Decrease Pomalidomide Plasma Concentrations
                     
                        
                           Smoking: Cigarette smoking may reduce pomalidomide exposure due to CYP1A2 induction. Patients should be advised that smoking may reduce the efficacy of pomalidomide.
                        
                           CYP1A2 inducers: Co-administration of POMALYST with drugs that are CYP1A2 inducers has not been studied and may reduce pomalidomide exposure.
