                  AcetaZOLAMIDE is a potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, effective 
in the control of fluid secretion (e.g., some types of glaucoma), in the 
treatment of certain convulsive disorders (e.g., epilepsy), and in the promotion 
of diuresis in instances of abnormal fluid retention (e.g., cardiac edema).
                  AcetaZOLAMIDE is not a mercurial diuretic. Rather, it is a nonbacteriostatic 
sulfonamide possessing a chemical structure and pharmacological activity 
distinctly different from the bacteriostatic sulfonamides.
                  AcetaZOLAMIDE is an enzyme inhibitor that acts specifically on carbonic 
anhydrase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the 
hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In the eye, 
this inhibitory action of acetaZOLAMIDE decreases the secretion of aqueous humor 
and results in a drop in intraocular pressure, a reaction considered desirable 
in cases of glaucoma and even in certain nonglaucomatous conditions. Evidence 
seems to indicate that acetaZOLAMIDE has utility as an adjuvant in the treatment 
of certain dysfunctions of the central nervous system (e.g., epilepsy). 
Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in this area appears to retard abnormal, 
paroxysmal, excessive discharge from central nervous system neurons. The 
diuretic effect of acetaZOLAMIDE is due to its action in the kidney on the 
reversible reaction involving hydration of carbon dioxide and dehydration of 
carbonic acid. The result of renal loss of HCO3 ion, 
which carries out sodium, water, and potassium. Alkalinization of the urine and 
promotion of diuresis are thus affected. Alteration in ammonia metabolism occurs 
due to increased reabsorption of ammonia by the renal tubules as a result of 
urinary alkalinization.
                  Placebo-controlled clinical trials have shown that prophylactic 
administration of acetaZOLAMIDE at a dose of 250 mg every eight to 12 hours (or 
a 500 mg controlled-release capsule once daily) before and during rapid ascent 
to altitude results in fewer and/or less severe symptoms (such as headache, 
nausea, shortness of breath, dizziness, drowsiness, and fatigue) of acute 
mountain sickness (AMS). Pulmonary function (e.g., minute ventilation, expired 
vital capacity and peak flow) is greater in the acetaZOLAMIDE treated group, 
both in subjects with AMS and asymptomatic subjects. The acetaZOLAMIDE treated 
climbers also had less difficulty in sleeping.
