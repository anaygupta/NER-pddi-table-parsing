  Â® is thought to elicit a cellular immune reaction to 
         
 
  C. immitis, as evidenced by a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to Coccidioidin 
         
 
  (1,2,3,4). The general mechanism of the DTH response is based on the interaction of antigen with CD

  8 lymphocytes followed by the secretion of interleukins and other lymphokines from macrophage cells. The release of effector molecules causes endothelial cells lining the blood vessels to become permeable and allows fibrinogen to escape into the surrounding tissue where it is converted to fibrin. The deposition of fibrin and the accumulation of T-cells and monocytes within the extracellular spaces cause the tissue to swell and become indurated. This process is usually detectable in 18 hours and peaks at 48 hours.
