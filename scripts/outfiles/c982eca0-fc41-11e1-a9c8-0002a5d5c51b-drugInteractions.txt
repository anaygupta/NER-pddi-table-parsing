                           Concomitant administration of diclofenac and aspirin is not
                              generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse
                              effects including increased GI bleeding. (7.1)
                           Concomitant use of anticoagulants and diclofenac have a risk of
                              serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone. (7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Aspirin
                     
                        When administered with aspirin, diclofenac's protein binding is
                           reduced. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known;
                           however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of Zipsor and
                           aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of
                           increased adverse effects. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Anticoagulants
                     
                        The effects of anticoagulants such as of warfarin and NSAIDs on
                           GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have
                           a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than that with use of either drug
                           alone.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 ACE-inhibitors
                     
                        NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin
                           converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This interaction should be given
                           consideration in patients taking Zipsor concomitantly with
                           ACE-inhibitors.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Diuretics
                     
                        Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have
                           shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and
                           thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to
                           inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy
                           of Zipsor and diuretics, observe patients closely for signs of renal
                           failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)], as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Lithium
                     
                        NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a
                           reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium
                           concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by
                           approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of
                           renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when Zipsor and lithium
                           are administered concurrently, observe patients carefully for signs of
                           lithium toxicity. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6 Methotrexate
                     
                        NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate
                           accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This indicates that NSAIDs may
                           enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Use caution when Zipsor is
                           administered concomitantly with methotrexate.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.7 Cyclosporine
                     
                        Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, may affect renal prostaglandins
                           and increase the toxicity of certain drugs. Therefore, concomitant
                           therapy with Zipsor may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Use
                           caution when Zipsor is administered concomitantly with cyclosporine.
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.8 Inhibitors or Substrates of Cytochrome P450 2C9 Other Considerations
                     
                        Diclofenac is metabolized predominantly by cytochrome P450 2C9.
                           Co-administration of diclofenac with another drug medication known to be
                           metabolized by or that which inhibits Cytochrome P450 2C9 may
                           unpredictably affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac or the
                           co-administered drug medication. Caution should be used to evaluate each
                           patient's medical history when consideration is given to prescribing
                           Zipsor [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
