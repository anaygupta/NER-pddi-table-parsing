                     7.1  Diuretics
                     
                        Coadministration of empagliflozin with diuretics resulted in increased
urine volume and frequency of voids, which might enhance the potential
for volume depletion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues
                     
                        Coadministration of empagliflozin with insulin
or insulin secretagogues increases the risk for hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3  Positive Urine Glucose Test
                     
                        Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose
tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2
inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive
urine glucose tests.  Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic
control.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4  Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay
                     
                        Monitoring glycemic control with
1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable
in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors.
 Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.
