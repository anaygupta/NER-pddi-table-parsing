                        Zithranol Shampoo contains anthralin, a synthetic compound whose precise mechanism of antipsoriatic action is not yet fully understood. However, numerous studies have demonstrated antiproliferative and antiinflammatory effects of anthralin on psoriatic and normal skin. The antiproliferative effects of anthralin appear to result from both an inhibition of DNA synthesis as well as from its strong reducing properties. Recently, anthralinâ€™s effectiveness as an antipsoriatic agent has also been in part attributed to its ability to induce lipid peroxidation and reduce levels of endothelial adhesion molecules, which are markedly elevated in psoriatic patients. Unlike retinoids and PUVA, anthralin does not inhibit liver microsomal enzyme activity; consequently, the likelihood of adverse drug interactions is greatly reduced when other agents are administered concomitantly with anthralin.
