                           Beta-adrenergic blocking agents
                           
                              (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS). Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Long-acting nitrates
                           
                              Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination.

                              Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Quinidine
                           
                              There have been rare reports of an interaction between quinidine and nifedipine (with a decreased plasma level of quinidine).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Coumarin anticoagulants
                           
                              There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Cimetidine
                           
                              A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised.

                                 Grapefruit Juice
                                 
                                    Co-administration of nifedipine with grapefruit juice resulted in approximately a 2-fold increase in nifedipine AUC and Cmax with no change in half-life. The increased plasma concentrations are most likely due to inhibition of CYP 3A4 related first-pass metabolism. Co-administration of nifedipine with grapefruit juice is to be avoided.
