It acts by restricting the synthesis of folic acid required by bacteria for growth, by its competition with para-aminobenzoic acid. There are no clinical data available on the degree and rate of systemic competition with para-aminobenzoic acid absorption of  Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% Wash when applied to the skin or scalp.   However, significant absorption of sodium sulfacetamide through the skin has been reported.  The following in vitro data are available but their clinical significance is unknown. Organisms which show susceptibility to  sodium sulfacetamide are: Streptococci, Staphylococci, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Salmonella species, Proteus vulgaris, Nocardia and Actinomyces.
