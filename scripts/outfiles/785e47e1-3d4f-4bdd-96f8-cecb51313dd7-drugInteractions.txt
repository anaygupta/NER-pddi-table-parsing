                        Human pharmacologic studies have shown that Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Oral Solution may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, primidone), phenylbutazone, and tricyclic drugs (imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine). Downward dosage adjustments of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Oral Solution.
