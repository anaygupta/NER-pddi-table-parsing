                  SURMONTIL is an antidepressant with an anxiety-reducing sedative component to its action.  The mode of action of SURMONTIL on the central nervous system is not known.  However, unlike amphetamine-type compounds it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system.  It does not act by inhibition of the monoamine oxidase system.
                  The single-dose pharmacokinetics of trimipramine were evaluated in a comparative study of 24 elderly subjects and 24 younger subjects; no clinically relevant differences were demonstrated based on age or gender.
