                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                         Plerixafor is an inhibitor of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor and
                           blocks binding of its cognate ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1α
                           (SDF-1α).  SDF-1α and CXCR4 are recognized to play a role in the
                           trafficking and homing of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the
                           marrow compartment. Once in the marrow, stem cell CXCR4 can act to help
                           anchor these cells to the marrow matrix, either directly via SDF-1α or
                           through the induction of other adhesion molecules. Treatment with
                           plerixafor resulted in leukocytosis and elevations in circulating
                           hematopoietic progenitor cells in mice, dogs and humans.  CD34+ cells
                           mobilized by plerixafor were capable of engraftment with long-term
                           repopulating capacity up to one year in canine transplantation models.
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                         Data on the fold increase in peripheral blood CD34+ cell count
                           (cells/mcL) by apheresis day were evaluated in two placebo-controlled
                           clinical studies in patients with NHL and MM (Study 1 and Study 2,
                           respectively). The fold increase in CD34+ cell count (cells/mcL) over the
                           24-hour period starting from the day prior to the first apheresis and
                           ending the next morning just before the first apheresis is summarized in
                              Table
                           3.  During this 24-hour period, a single dose of Mozobil or
                           placebo was administered 10 to 11 hours prior to apheresis. 
                        


                        


In pharmacodynamic studies of Mozobil in healthy volunteers, peak
                           mobilization of CD34+ cells was observed between 6 and 9 hours after
                           administration. In pharmacodynamic studies of Mozobil in conjunction with
                           G-CSF in healthy volunteers, a sustained elevation in the peripheral
                           blood CD34+ count was observed from 4 to 18 hours after plerixafor
                           administration with a peak CD34+ count between 10 and 14
                        hours.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The single-dose pharmacokinetics of plerixafor 0.24 mg/kg were
                           evaluated in patients with NHL and MM following pre-treatment with G-CSF
                           (10 micrograms/kg once daily for 4 consecutive days).  Plerixafor
                           exhibits linear kinetics between the 0.04 mg/kg to 0.24 mg/kg dose
                           range.  The pharmacokinetics of plerixafor were similar across clinical
                           studies in healthy subjects who received plerixafor alone and NHL and MM
                           patients who received plerixafor in combination with G-CSF.
                         A population pharmacokinetic analysis incorporated plerixafor
                           data from 63 subjects (NHL patients, MM patients, subjects with varying
                           degrees of renal impairment, and healthy subjects) who received a single
                           SC dose (0.04 mg/kg to 0.24 mg/kg) of plerixafor.  A two-compartment
                           disposition model with first order absorption and elimination was found
                           to adequately describe the plerixafor concentration-time profile.
                           Significant relationships between clearance and creatinine clearance
                              (CLCR), as well as between central volume of distribution
                           and body weight were observed.  The distribution half-life
                           (t1/2α) was estimated to be 0.3 hours and the terminal
                           population half-life (t1/2β) was 5.3 hours in patients with
                           normal renal function. 
                         The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the
                           mg/kg-based dosage results in an increased plerixafor exposure
                              (AUC0-24h) with increasing body weight.  There is limited
                           experience with the 0.24 mg/kg dose of plerixafor in patients weighing
                           above 160 kg.  Therefore the dose should not exceed that of a 160 kg
                           patient (i.e., 40 mg/day if CLCR is > 50 mL/min and 27
                           mg/day if CLCR is ≤ 50 mL/min).

                           Peak plasma concentrations occurred at approximately 30 - 60
                           minutes after a SC dose.

                           Plerixafor is bound to human plasma proteins up to 58%. The
                           apparent volume of distribution of plerixafor in humans is 0.3 L/kg
                           demonstrating that plerixafor is largely confined to, but not limited to,
                           the extravascular fluid space. 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Metabolism
                                 
                                 

                              
                           The metabolism of plerixafor was evaluated with 
                              in vitro
                            assays.  Plerixafor is not metabolized as shown in assays
                           using human liver microsomes or human primary hepatocytes and does not
                           exhibit inhibitory activity 
                              in vitro
                            towards the major drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes
                           (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5). In
                               in vitro
                            studies with human hepatocytes, plerixafor does not induce
                           CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 enzymes. These findings suggest that plerixafor
                           has a low potential for involvement in cytochrome P450-dependent
                           drug-drug interactions. 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Elimination
                                 
                                 

                              
                           The major route of elimination of plerixafor is urinary.
                           Following a 0.24 mg/kg dose in healthy volunteers with normal renal
                           function, approximately 70% of the dose was excreted in the urine as the
                           parent drug during the first 24 hours following administration. In
                           studies with healthy subjects and patients, the terminal half-life in
                           plasma ranges between 3 and 5 hours. At concentrations similar to what
                           are seen clinically, plerixafor did not act as a substrate or inhibitor
                           of P-glycoprotein in an 
                              in vitro
                            study with MDCKII and MDCKII-MDR1 cell
                           models. 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Renal Impairment
                                 
                                 

                              
                           Following a single 0.24 mg/kg SC dose, plerixafor clearance was
                           reduced in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment and was
                           positively correlated with CLCR.  The mean AUC0-24h
                           of plerixafor in subjects with mild (CLCR 51-80 mL/min),
                           moderate (CLCR 31-50 mL/min), and severe (CLCR
                           < 31 mL/min) renal impairment was 7%, 32%, and 39% higher than
                           healthy subjects with normal renal function, respectively.  Renal
                           impairment had no effect on Cmax. A population pharmacokinetic
                           analysis indicated an increased exposure
                           (AUC0-24h) in patients with moderate and severe
                           renal impairment compared to patients with CLCR > 50
                           mL/min. These results support a dose reduction of one-third in patients
                           with moderate to severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 50 mL/min) in
                           order to match the exposure in patients with normal renal function. The
                           population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the mg/kg-based dosage
                           results in an increased plerixafor exposure (AUC0-24h) with
                           increasing body weight; therefore if CLCR is ≤ 50 mL/min the
                           dose should not exceed 27 mg/day.

                        Since plerixafor is primarily eliminated by the kidneys,
                           coadministration of plerixafor with drugs that reduce renal function or
                           compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of
                           plerixafor or the coadministered drug.  The effects of coadministration
                           of plerixafor with other drugs that are renally eliminated or are known
                           to affect renal function have not been evaluated.

                     12.4 QT/QTc Prolongation
                     
                        There is no indication of a QT/QTc prolonging effect of Mozobil
                           in single doses up to 0.40 mg/kg. In a randomized, double-blind,
                           crossover study, 48 healthy subjects were administered a single
                           subcutaneous dose of Mozobil (0.24 mg/kg and 0.40 mg/kg) and placebo.
                           Peak concentrations for 0.40 mg/kg Mozobil were approximately 1.8-fold
                           higher than the peak concentrations following the 0.24 mg/kg single
                           subcutaneous dose.
