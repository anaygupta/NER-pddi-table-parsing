                  This drug should not be used with the following
medications because very serious interactions may occur: live influenza virus
vaccine, pramlintide. Because of this productâ€™s effect on gastrointestinal motility
and gastric emptying, it may decrease the absorption of other oral medications
during concurrent use such as: urinary alkalizers; thiazide diuretics (may cause
the urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by
inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde); antimuscarinics (concurrent use may
intensify antimuscarinic effects of hyoscyamine sulfate because of secondary
antimuscarinic activities of these medications); antacids/antidiarrheals (may
reduce absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate, concurrent use with antacids may
cause urine to become alkaline, reducing effectiveness of methenamine by
inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde). Doses of these medications should
be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of hyoscyamine sulfate; antimyasthenics
(concurrent use with hyoscyamine sulfate may further reduce intestinal motility);
ketoconazole (patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2
hours after ketoconazole); monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent
use may intensify antimuscarinic side effects), opioid (narcotic analgesics may
result in increased risk of severe constipation); sulfonamides (these drugs may
precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine, increasing the danger of crystalluria).
This is not a complete list of all drug interactions. Tell your doctor or pharmacist
of all prescription medications prior to use.
