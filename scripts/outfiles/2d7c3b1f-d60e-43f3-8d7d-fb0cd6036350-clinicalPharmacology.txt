                  Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and 
cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement 
therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are 
primarily used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many 
organ systems.
                  Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, 
they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli.
