                           Concomitant use of antihypertensive medications and vasodilators: increased risk for hypotension, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, falls, and injuries (7.2)
                           Dopamine antagonists such as neuroleptics or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of APOKYN (7.3) 
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	5HT3 Antagonists
                     
                        Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when APOKYN was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of APOKYN with 5HT3 antagonists including antiemetics (for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron) and alosetron, is contraindicated. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Antihypertensive Medications and Vasodilators
                     
                        The following adverse events were experienced more commonly in patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medications or vasodilators (n = 94) compared to patients not receiving these concomitant drugs (n = 456): hypotension 10% vs 4%, myocardial infarction 3% vs 1%, serious pneumonia 5% vs 3%, serious falls 9% vs 3%, and bone and joint injuries 6% vs 2%. The mechanism underlying many of these events is unknown, but may represent increased hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	Dopamine Antagonists
                     
                        Since APOKYN is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that concomitant use of dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of APOKYN. Patients with major psychotic disorders, treated with neuroleptics, should be treated with dopamine agonists only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4	Drugs Prolonging the QT/QTc Interval
                     
                        Caution should be exercised when prescribing APOKYN concomitantly with drugs that prolong the QT/QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].
