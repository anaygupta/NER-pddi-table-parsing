                        Rilpivirine is an antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

                                 Effects on Electrocardiogram
                              
                              The effect of EDURANT at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily on the QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) controlled crossover study in 60 healthy adults, with 13 measurements over 24 hours at steady state. The maximum mean time-matched (95% upper confidence bound) differences in QTcF interval from placebo after baseline-correction was 2.0 (5.0) milliseconds (i.e., below the threshold of clinical concern).
                              When supratherapeutic doses of 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily of EDURANT were studied in healthy adults, the maximum mean time-matched (95% upper confidence bound) differences in QTcF interval from placebo after baseline-correction were 10.7 (15.3) and 23.3 (28.4) milliseconds, respectively. Steady-state administration of EDURANT 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily resulted in a mean steady-state Cmax approximately 2.6-fold and 6.7-fold, respectively, higher than the mean Cmax observed with the recommended 25 mg once daily dose of EDURANT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

                              The pharmacokinetic properties of rilpivirine have been evaluated in adult healthy subjects and in adult antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected subjects. Exposure to rilpivirine was generally lower in HIV-1 infected subjects than in healthy subjects.
                              


                           



                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Absorption and Bioavailability
                              
                              After oral administration, the maximum plasma concentration of rilpivirine is generally achieved within 4–5 hours. The absolute bioavailability of EDURANT is unknown.

                              The exposure to rilpivirine was approximately 40% lower when EDURANT was taken in a fasted condition as compared to a normal caloric meal (533 kcal) or high-fat high-caloric meal (928 kcal). When EDURANT was taken with only a protein-rich nutritional drink, exposures were 50% lower than when taken with a meal.

                              Rilpivirine is approximately 99.7% bound to plasma proteins in vitro, primarily to albumin. The distribution of rilpivirine into compartments other than plasma (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, genital tract secretions) has not been evaluated in humans.

                                 In vitro experiments indicate that rilpivirine primarily undergoes oxidative metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A system.

                              The terminal elimination half-life of rilpivirine is approximately 50 hours. After single dose oral administration of 14C-rilpivirine, on average 85% and 6.1% of the radioactivity could be retrieved in feces and urine, respectively. In feces, unchanged rilpivirine accounted for on average 25% of the administered dose. Only trace amounts of unchanged rilpivirine (< 1% of dose) were detected in urine.

                                    Rilpivirine is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver. In a study comparing 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score A) to 8 matched controls, and 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score B) to 8 matched controls, the multiple dose exposure of rilpivirine was 47% higher in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 5% higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. EDURANT has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

                                    Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to rilpivirine.

                                    Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that rilpivirine exposure was similar in HIV-1 infected subjects with mild renal impairment relative to HIV-1 infected subjects with normal renal function. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment. There is limited or no information regarding the pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or in patients with end-stage renal disease, and rilpivirine concentrations may be increased due to alteration of drug absorption, distribution, and metabolism secondary to renal dysfunction. The potential impact is not expected to be of clinical relevance for HIV-1-infected subjects with moderate renal impairment, and no dose adjustment is required in these patients. Rilpivirine should be used with caution and with increased monitoring for adverse effects in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. As rilpivirine is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

There was no clinically significant impact of body weight on rilpivirine pharmacokinetics in pediatric subjects in trial C213 (33 to 93 kg).

                              Rilpivirine is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A, and drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine. Co-administration of EDURANT and drugs that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine and loss of virologic response and possible resistance. Co-administration of EDURANT and drugs that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. Co-administration of EDURANT with drugs that increase gastric pH may result in decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine and loss of virologic response and possible resistance to rilpivirine and to the class of NNRTIs.
                              EDURANT at a dose of 25 mg q.d. is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal products metabolised by CYP enzymes.
                              Drug interaction studies were performed with EDURANT and other drugs likely to be co-administered or commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions. The effects of co-administration of other drugs on the Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values of rilpivirine are summarized in Table 7 (effect of other drugs on EDURANT). The effect of co-administration of EDURANT on the Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values of other drugs are summarized in Table 8 (effect of EDURANT on other drugs).

                              Rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and inhibits HIV-1 replication by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Rilpivirine does not inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases α, β and γ.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture
                              
                              Rilpivirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 in an acutely infected T-cell line with a median EC50 value for HIV-1IIIB of 0.73 nM (0.27 ng/mL). Rilpivirine demonstrated limited activity in cell culture against HIV-2 with a median EC50 value of 5220 nM (range 2510 to 10830 nM) (920 to 3970 ng/mL).
                              Rilpivirine demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (subtype A, B, C, D, F, G, H) primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 0.07 to 1.01 nM (0.03 to 0.37 ng/mL) and was less active against group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 2.88 to 8.45 nM (1.06 to 3.10 ng/mL).
                              The antiviral activity of rilpivirine was not antagonistic when combined with the NNRTIs efavirenz, etravirine or nevirapine; the N(t)RTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir or zidovudine; the PIs amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir or tipranavir; the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide; the CCR5 co-receptor antagonist maraviroc, or the integrase strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir.

                                    Rilpivirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different origins and subtypes as well as NNRTI resistant HIV-1. The frequently observed amino acid substitutions that emerged and conferred decreased phenotypic susceptibility to rilpivirine included: L100I, K101E, V106I and A, V108I, E138K and G, Q, R, V179F and I, Y181C and I, V189I, G190E, H221Y, F227C and M230I and L.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       In Treatment-Naïve Adult Subjects
                                    
                                    In the Week 96 pooled resistance analysis of the Phase 3 trials C209 and C215, the emergence of resistance was greater among subjects' viruses in the EDURANT arm compared to the efavirenz arm, and was dependent on baseline viral load. In the pooled resistance analysis, 58% (57/98) of the subjects who qualified for resistance analysis (resistance analysis subjects) in the EDURANT arm had virus with genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine compared to 45% (25/56) of the resistance analysis subjects in the efavirenz arm who had genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to efavirenz. Moreover, genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to a background drug (emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir, abacavir or zidovudine) emerged in viruses from 52% (51/98) of the resistance analysis subjects in the rilpivirine arm compared to 23% (13/56) in the efavirenz arm.
                                    Emerging NNRTI substitutions in the rilpivirine resistance analysis of subjects' viruses included V90I, K101E/P/T, E138K/A/Q/G, V179I/L, Y181C/I, V189I, H221Y, F227C/L and M230L, which were associated with a rilpivirine phenotypic fold change range of 2.6 – 621. The E138K substitution emerged most frequently during rilpivirine treatment commonly in combination with the M184I substitution. The emtricitabine and lamivudine resistance-associated substitutions M184I or V and NRTI resistance-associated substitutions (K65R/N, A62V, D67N/G, K70E, Y115F, T215S/T, or K219E/R) emerged more frequently in rilpivirine resistance analysis subjects compared to efavirenz resistance analysis subjects (see Table 9).
                                    NNRTI- and NRTI-resistance substitutions emerged less frequently in resistance analysis of viruses from subjects with baseline viral load of ≤ 100,000 copies/mL compared to viruses from subjects with baseline viral load of > 100,000 copies/mL: 26% (14/54) compared to 74% (40/54) of NNRTI-resistance substitutions and 22% (11/50) compared to 78% (39/50) of NRTI-resistance substitutions. This difference was also observed for the individual emtricitabine/lamivudine and tenofovir resistance substitutions: 23% (11/47) compared to 77% (36/47) for M184I/V and 0% (0/8) compared to 100% (8/8) for K65R/N. Additionally, NNRTI- and NRTI-resistance substitutions emerged less frequently in the resistance analysis of viruses from subjects with baseline CD4+ cell counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 compared to viruses from subjects with baseline CD4+ cell counts < 200 cells/mm3: 37% (20/54) compared to 63% (34/54) of NNRTI-resistance substitutions and 28% (14/50) compared to 72% (36/50) of NRTI-resistance substitutions.

                                    Cross-resistance has been observed among NNRTIs. The single NNRTI substitutions K101P, Y181I and Y181V conferred 52-fold, 15-fold and 12-fold decreased susceptibility to rilpivirine, respectively. The combination of E138K and M184I showed 6.7-fold reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine compared to 2.8-fold for E138K alone. The K103N substitution did not result in reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine by itself. However, the combination of K103N and L100I resulted in a 7-fold reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine. Combinations of 2 or 3 NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions had decreased susceptibility to rilpivirine (fold change range of 3.7 – 554) in 38% and 66% of mutants analyzed, respectively.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected adult subjects
                                    
                                    Considering all of the available cell culture and clinical data, any of the following amino acid substitutions, when present at baseline, are likely to decrease the antiviral activity of rilpivirine: K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138R, E138Q, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, Y188L, H221Y, F227C, M230I or M230L.
                                    Cross-resistance to efavirenz, etravirine and/or nevirapine is likely after virologic failure and development of rilpivirine resistance. In the Week 96 pooled analyses of the Phase 3 TMC278-C209 and TMC278-C215 clinical trials, 50 of the 87 (57%) rilpivirine resistance analysis subjects with post-baseline resistance data had virus with decreased susceptibility to rilpivirine (≥ 2.5 fold change). Of these, 86% (n= 43/50) were resistant to efavirenz (≥ 3.3 fold change), 90% (n= 45/50) were resistant to etravirine (≥ 3.2 fold change) and 62% (n= 31/50) were resistant to nevirapine (≥ 6 fold change). In the efavirenz arm, 3 of the 21 (14%) efavirenz resistance analysis subjects' viruses were resistant to etravirine and rilpivirine, and 95% (n= 20/21) were resistant to nevirapine. Virus from subjects experiencing virologic failure on EDURANT developed more NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions conferring more cross-resistance to the NNRTI class and had a higher likelihood of cross-resistance to all NNRTIs in the class compared to virus from subjects who failed on efavirenz.
