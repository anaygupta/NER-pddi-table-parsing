                        Physical Incompatibilities:  M.V.I. Pediatric速 is not physically compatible with alkaline solutions
or moderately alkaline drugs such as Diamox (Acetazolamide), Diuril
Intravenous Sodium (Chlorothiazide sodium), Aminophylline or sodium
bicarbonate.
                        M.V.I. Pediatric速 is not physically compatible with ampicillin and it may not be physically
compatible with ACHROMYCIN (tetracycline HCl). It has also been reported
that folic acid is unstable in the presence of calcium salts such
as calcium gluconate. Direct addition of M.V.I.  Pediatric速 to intravenous fat emulsions is not recommended. Consult appropriate
references for listings of physical compatibility of solutions and
drugs with the vitamin infusion. In such circumstances, admixture
or Y-site administration with vitamin solutions should be avoided.
                        Several vitamins have been reported to decrease the activity
of certain antibiotics. Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide,
and ascorbic acid have been reported to decrease the antibiotic activity
of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin.
Bleomycin is inactivated 
                              in vitro
                            by ascorbic acid and riboflavin.
                        Some of the
vitamins in M.V.I. Pediatric速 may react with vitamin
K bisulfite or sodium bisulfite; if bisulfite solutions are necessary,
patients should be monitored for vitamin A and thiamine deficiencies.
