                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The primary activity of NovoLog Mix 70/30 is the regulation of 
glucose metabolism. Insulins, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, bind to the insulin 
receptors on muscle, liver and fat cells and lower blood glucose by facilitating 
the cellular uptake of glucose and simultaneously inhibiting the output of 
glucose from the liver.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        The two euglycemic clamp studies described below 
                              [see 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
                            assessed glucose utilization after 
dosing of healthy volunteers. NovoLog Mix 70/30 has an earlier onset of action 
than human premix 70/30 in studies of normal volunteers and patients with 
diabetes. The onset of action is between 10-20 minutes for NovoLog Mix 70/30 
compared to 30 minutes for Novolin 70/30. The mean ± SD time to peak activity 
for NovoLog Mix 70/30 is 2.4 hr ± 0.8hr compared to 4.2 hr ± 0.4 hr for Novolin 
70/30. The duration of action may be as long as 24 hours (see Figure 2).

                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The single substitution of the amino acid proline with aspartic 
acid at position B28 in insulin aspart (NovoLog) reduces the molecule’s tendency 
to form hexamers as observed with regular human insulin. The rapid absorption 
characteristics of NovoLog are maintained by NovoLog Mix 70/30. The insulin 
aspart in the soluble component of NovoLog Mix 70/30 is absorbed more rapidly 
from the subcutaneous layer than regular human insulin. The remaining 70% is in 
crystalline form as insulin aspart protamine which has a prolonged absorption 
profile after subcutaneous injection.
                        
                           Bioavailability and Absorption- The relative 
bioavailability of NovoLog Mix 70/30 compared to NovoLog and Novolin 70/30 
indicates that the insulins are absorbed to similar extent. In euglycemic clamp 
studies in healthy volunteers (n=23) after dosing with NovoLog Mix 70/30 (0.2 
U/kg), a mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of 23.4 
± 5.3 mU/L was reached after 60 minutes. The mean half-life (t1/2) of NovoLog Mix 70/30 was about 8 to 9 hours. Serum insulin 
levels returned to baseline 15 to 18 hours after a subcutaneous dose of NovoLog 
Mix 70/30. Similar data were seen in a separate euglycemic clamp study in 
healthy volunteers (n=24) after dosing with NovoLog Mix 70/30 (0.3 U/kg). A 
Cmax of 61.3 ± 20.1 mU/L was reached after 85 minutes. 
Serum insulin levels returned to baseline 12 hours after a subcutaneous 
dose.
                        The Cmax and the area under the insulin 
concentration-time curve (AUC) after administration of NovoLog Mix 70/30 was 
approximately 20% greater than those after administration of Novolin 70/30, (see 
Fig. 3 for pharmacokinetic profiles).

70/30 and Novolin 70/30
                        
                           Distribution and Elimination- NovoLog has a low 
binding to plasma proteins, 0 to 9%, similar to regular human insulin. After 
subcutaneous administration in normal male volunteers (n=24), NovoLog was more 
rapidly eliminated than regular human insulin with an average apparent half-life 
of 81 minutes compared to 141 minutes for regular human insulin.
                        The effect of sex, age, obesity, ethnic origin, renal and hepatic impairment, 
pregnancy, or smoking, on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of NovoLog 
Mix 70/30 has not been studied.
