                         Specific drug interaction studies have not been
                                    conducted. Cholestyramine has been reported to reduce intestinal
                                    absorption of fat-soluble vitamins; therefore, it may impair
                                    intestinal absorption of doxercalciferol. Magnesium-containing
                                    antacids and Hectorol should not be used concomitantly because
                                    such use may lead to the development of hypermagnesemia (see

                                    that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption
                                    and availability of Hectorol. Although not examined
                                    specifically, enzyme inducers (such as glutethimide and
                                    phenobarbital) may affect the 25-hydroxylation of Hectorol and
                                    may necessitate dosage adjustments. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors
                                    (such as ketoconazole and erythromycin) may inhibit the
                                    25-hydroxylation of Hectorol. Hence, formation of the active
                                    Hectorol moiety may be hindered.
