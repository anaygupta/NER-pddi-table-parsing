                              Thorough QT studies have been conducted for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir.
                              The effect of ledipasvir 120 mg twice daily (2.67 times the maximum recommended dosage) for 10 days on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, multiple-dose, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) three period crossover thorough QT trial in 59 healthy subjects.  At the dose of 120 mg twice daily (2.67 times the maximum recommended dosage), ledipasvir does not prolong QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.
                              The effect of sofosbuvir 400 mg (maximum recommended dosage) and 1200 mg (three times the maximum recommended dosage) on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) four period crossover thorough QT trial in 59 healthy subjects. At a dose three times the maximum recommended dose, sofosbuvir does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent.

                                 Absorption
                              
                              The pharmacokinetic properties of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in subjects with chronic hepatitis C. Following oral administration of HARVONI, ledipasvir median peak concentrations were observed 4 to 4.5 hours post-dose. Sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and the peak median plasma concentration was observed ~0.8 to 1 hour post-dose. Median peak plasma concentration of GS-331007 was observed between 3.5 to 4 hours post-dose.
                              Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected subjects, geometric mean steady-state AUC0–24 for ledipasvir (N=2113), sofosbuvir (N=1542), and GS-331007 (N=2113) were 7290, 1320, and 12,000 ng∙hr/mL, respectively. Steady-state Cmax for ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were 323, 618, and 707 ng/mL, respectively. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0–24 and Cmax were similar in healthy adult subjects and subjects with HCV infection. Relative to healthy subjects (N=191), ledipasvir AUC0–24 and Cmax were 24% lower and 32% lower, respectively, in HCV-infected subjects.

                              Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of HARVONI with a moderate fat (~600 kcal, 25% to 30% fat) or high fat (~1000 kcal, 50% fat) meal increased sofosbuvir AUC0–inf by approximately 2-fold, but did not significantly affect sofosbuvir Cmax. The exposures of GS-331007 and ledipasvir were not altered in the presence of either meal type. The response rates in Phase 3 trials were similar in HCV-infected subjects who received HARVONI with food or without food. HARVONI can be administered without regard to food.

                              Ledipasvir is >99.8% bound to human plasma proteins. After a single 90 mg dose of [14C]-ledipasvir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of 14C-radioactivity ranged between 0.51 and 0.66.
                              Sofosbuvir is approximately 61–65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 1 µg/mL to 20 µg/mL. Protein binding of GS-331007 was minimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of 14C-radioactivity was approximately 0.7.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Metabolism
                              
                              In vitro, no detectable metabolism of ledipasvir was observed by human CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Evidence of slow oxidative metabolism via an unknown mechanism has been observed.  Following a single dose of 90 mg [14C]-ledipasvir, systemic exposure was almost exclusively to the parent drug (>98%).  Unchanged ledipasvir is the major species present in feces.
                              Sofosbuvir is extensively metabolized in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside analog triphosphate GS-461203. The metabolic activation pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester moiety catalyzed by human cathepsin A (CatA) or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and phosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) followed by phosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation results in the formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently rephosphorylated and lacks anti-HCV activity in vitro. After a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, GS-331007 accounted for approximately >90% of total systemic exposure.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Elimination
                              
                              Following a single 90 mg oral dose of [14C]-ledipasvir, mean total recovery of the [14C]-radioactivity in feces and urine was approximately 87%, with most of the radioactive dose recovered from feces (approximately 86%). Unchanged ledipasvir excreted in feces accounted for a mean of 70% of the administered dose and the oxidative metabolite M19 accounted for 2.2% of the dose. These data indicate that biliary excretion of unchanged ledipasvir is a major route of elimination, with renal excretion being a minor pathway (approximately 1%).  The median terminal half-life of ledipasvir following administration of HARVONI was 47 hours.
                              Following a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose was greater than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, feces, and expired air, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while 3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. These data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for GS-331007. The median terminal half-lives of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 following administration of HARVONI were 0.5 and 27 hours, respectively.

                                       Patients with Renal Impairment:  The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in HCV negative subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault). No clinically relevant differences in ledipasvir pharmacokinetics were observed between healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment.
                                    The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied in HCV negative subjects with mild (eGFR ≥50 and <80 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate (eGFR ≥30 and <50 mL/min/1.73m2), severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2), and subjects with ESRD requiring hemodialysis following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir. Relative to subjects with normal renal function (eGFR >80 mL/min/1.73m2), the sofosbuvir AUC0–inf was 61%, 107%, and 171% higher in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0–inf was 55%, 88%, and 451% higher, respectively. In subjects with ESRD, relative to subjects with normal renal function, sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0–inf was 28% and 1280% higher when sofosbuvir was dosed 1 hour before hemodialysis compared with 60% and 2070% higher when sofosbuvir was dosed 1 hour after hemodialysis, respectively. A 4 hour hemodialysis session removed approximately 18% of administered dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
                                    
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Race:  Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007.

AUC and Cmax of ledipasvir were 77% and 58% higher, respectively, in females than males; however, the relationship between gender and ledipasvir exposures was not considered clinically relevant, as high response rates (SVR >90%) were achieved in male and female subjects across the Phase 3 studies and the safety profiles are similar in females and males.

                                       Geriatric Patients:  Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected subjects showed that within the age range (18 to 80 years) analyzed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Patients with Hepatic Impairment:  The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in HCV negative subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Ledipasvir plasma exposure (AUC0–inf) was similar in subjects with severe hepatic impairment and control subjects with normal hepatic function. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that cirrhosis had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of ledipasvir [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].
                                    The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in HCV-infected subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B and C). Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0–24 were 126% and 143% higher in moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0–24 were 18% and 9% higher, respectively. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that cirrhosis had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Drug Interaction Studies
                              
                              Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin or St. John's wort) may decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI, and the use with P-gp inducers is not recommended with HARVONI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Coadministration with drugs that inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP may increase ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations without increasing GS-331007 plasma concentration; HARVONI may be coadministered with P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitors. Neither ledipasvir nor sofosbuvir is a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters OCT1, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3.  GS-331007 is not a substrate for renal transporters, including organic anion transporter OAT1 or OAT3, or organic cation transporter OCT2.
                              Ledipasvir is subject to slow oxidative metabolism via an unknown mechanism. In vitro, no detectable metabolism of ledipasvir by CYP enzymes has been observed. Biliary excretion of unchanged ledipasvir is a major route of elimination.  Sofosbuvir is not a substrate for CYP and UGT1A1 enzymes. Clinically significant drug interactions with HARVONI mediated by CYP or UGT1A1 enzymes are not expected.
                              The effects of coadministered drugs on the exposure of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 are shown in Table 4 [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].
                              
                              


                              


No effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 was observed with the combination of abacavir and lamivudine, or emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir DF, or raltegravir.
                              Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of coadministered substrates for these transporters. Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BSEP only at concentrations exceeding those achieved in clinic.  Ledipasvir is not an inhibitor of transporters MRP2, MRP4, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, and OCT1. The drug-drug interaction potential of ledipasvir is primarily limited to the intestinal inhibition of P-gp and BCRP. Clinically relevant transporter inhibition by ledipasvir in the systemic circulation is not expected due to its high protein binding. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1, and GS-331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2, and MATE1.
                              Ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 are not inhibitors or inducers of CYP or UGT1A1 enzymes.
                              The effects of ledipasvir or sofosbuvir on the exposure of coadministered drugs are shown in Table 5 [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].
                              
                              


                              


No effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the following coadministered drugs was observed with ledipasvir or sofosbuvir: abacavir, cyclosporine, darunavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, emtricitabine, lamivudine, methadone, or rilpivirine.

                              Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein, which is required for viral replication. Resistance selection in cell culture and cross-resistance studies indicate ledipasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action.
                              Sofosbuvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is required for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog triphosphate (GS-461203), which can be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. In a biochemical assay, GS-461203 inhibited the polymerase activity of the recombinant NS5B from HCV genotypes 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a with IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 2.6 µM. GS-461203 is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and RNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase.

                              In HCV replicon assays, the EC50 values of ledipasvir against full-length replicons from genotypes 1a and 1b were 0.031 nM and 0.004 nM, respectively.  The median EC50 values of ledipasvir against chimeric replicons encoding NS5A sequences from clinical isolates were 0.018 nM for genotype 1a (range 0.009–0.085 nM; N=30) and 0.006 nM for genotype 1b (range 0.004–0.007 nM; N=3). Ledipasvir has less antiviral activity compared to genotype 1 against genotypes 4a, 5a, and 6a, with EC50 values of 0.39 nM, 0.15 nM, and 1.1 nM, respectively. Ledipasvir has substantially lower activity against genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a, and 6e with EC50 values of 21–249 nM, 16–530 nM, 168 nM, and 264 nM, respectively.
                              In HCV replicon assays, the EC50 values of sofosbuvir against full-length replicons from genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a, and chimeric 1b replicons encoding NS5B from genotypes 2b, 5a, or 6a ranged from 14–110 nM. The median EC50 value of sofosbuvir against chimeric replicons encoding NS5B sequences from clinical isolates was 62 nM for genotype 1a (range 29–128 nM; N=67), 102 nM for genotype 1b (range 45–170 nM; N=29), 29 nM for genotype 2 (range 14–81 nM; N=15), and 81 nM for genotype 3a (range 24–181 nM; N=106). In replication competent virus assays, the EC50 values of sofosbuvir against genotypes 1a and 2a were 30 nM and 20 nM, respectively. Evaluation of sofosbuvir in combination with ledipasvir showed no antagonistic effect in reducing HCV RNA levels in replicon cells.

                                       In Cell Culture
                                    
                                    HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir have been selected in cell culture for genotypes 1a and 1b. Reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir was associated with the primary NS5A amino acid substitution Y93H in both genotypes 1a and 1b. Additionally, a Q30E substitution emerged in genotype 1a replicons. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Y93H in both genotypes 1a and 1b, as well as the Q30E substitution in genotype 1a, conferred high levels of reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir (fold change in EC50 greater than 1000-fold).
                                    HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple genotypes including 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a, and 6a. Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated with the primary NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined. Site-directed mutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of 8 genotypes conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       In Clinical Trials
                                    
                                    In a pooled analysis of subjects who received HARVONI in Phase 3 trials, 37 subjects (29 with genotype 1a and 8 with genotype 1b) qualified for resistance analysis due to virologic failure (35 with virologic relapse, 2 with breakthrough on-treatment  due to documented non-adherence). Post-baseline NS5A and NS5B deep sequencing data (assay cutoff of 1%) were available for 37/37 and 36/37 subjects' viruses, respectively.
                                    Of the 29 genotype 1a virologic failure subjects, 55% (16/29) of subjects had virus with emergent NS5A resistance-associated substitutions K24R, M28T/V, Q30R/H/K/L, L31M, or Y93H/N at failure. Five of these 16 subjects also had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated amino acid positions. The most common substitutions detected at failure were Q30R, Y93H or N, and L31M.       
                                    Of the 8 genotype 1b virologic failure subjects, 88% (7/8) had virus with emergent NS5A resistance-associated substitutions L31V/M/I or Y93H at failure. Three of these 7 subjects also had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions. The most common substitution detected at failure was Y93H.
                                    At failure, 38% (14/37) of virologic failure subjects had 2 or more NS5A substitutions at resistance-associated positions.
                                    In phenotypic analyses, post-baseline isolates from subjects who harbored NS5A resistance-associated substitutions at failure showed 20- to >243-fold reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir.
                                    Treatment-emergent NS5B substitutions L159 (n=1) and V321 (n=2) previously associated with sofosbuvir failure were detected in the Phase 3 trials. In addition, NS5B substitutions at highly conserved positions D61G (n=3), A112T (n=2), E237G (n=2), and S473T (n=1) were detected at low frequency by next generation sequencing in treatment failure subjects infected with HCV GT1a.  The D61G substitution was previously described in subjects infected with HCV GT1a in a liver pre-transplant trial.  The clinical significance of these substitutions is currently unknown.
                                    The sofosbuvir-associated resistance substitution S282T in NS5B was not detected in any failure isolate from the Phase 3 trials. NS5B substitutions S282T, L320V/I, and V321I  in combination with NS5A substitutions L31M, Y93H, and Q30L were detected in one subject at failure following 8 weeks of treatment with HARVONI in a Phase 2 trial.

                              Ledipasvir was fully active against the sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B while all ledipasvir resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A were fully susceptible to sofosbuvir. Both sofosbuvir and ledipasvir were fully active against substitutions associated with resistance to other classes of direct-acting antivirals with different mechanisms of actions, such as NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitors and NS3 protease inhibitors. NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to ledipasvir may reduce the antiviral activity of other NS5A inhibitors. The efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has not been established in patients who have previously failed treatment with other regimens that include an NS5A inhibitor.

                              No data are available on the persistence of ledipasvir or sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitutions. NS5A resistance-associated substitutions for other NS5A inhibitors have been found to persist for >1 year in some patients.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Effect of Baseline HCV Polymorphisms on Treatment Response 
                              
                              Analyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions and relapse rates. In the pooled analysis of the Phase 3 trials, 23% (370/1589) of subjects' virus had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions (any change from reference at NS5A amino acid positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93) identified by population or deep sequencing.
                              In treatment-naïve subjects whose virus had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions in Studies ION-1 and ION-3, relapse rates were 6% (3/48) after 8 weeks and 1% (1/113) after 12 weeks of treatment with HARVONI. Relapse rates among subjects without baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions were 5% (8/167) after 8 weeks and 1% (3/306) after 12 weeks treatment with HARVONI. 
                              In treatment-experienced subjects whose virus had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions, relapse rates were 22% (5/23) after 12 weeks and 0% (0/19) after 24 weeks of treatment with HARVONI.
                              The specific baseline NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms observed among subjects with relapse were M28T/V, Q30H, Q30R, L31M, H58P, Y93H, and Y93N in genotype 1a, and L28M, A92T, and Y93H in genotype 1b. Subjects with multiple NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions appeared to have higher relapse rates.
                              SVR was achieved in all 24 subjects (N=20 with L159F+C316N; N=1 with L159F; and N=3 with N142T) who had baseline polymorphisms associated with resistance to NS5B nucleoside inhibitors. The sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T was not detected in the baseline NS5B sequence of any subject in Phase 3 trials by population or deep sequencing.
