                        Mechanism of Action
                     
                     
                        Frovatriptan is a 5-HT receptor agonist that binds with
                                    high affinity for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D
                                    receptors. Frovatriptan has no significant effects on
                                    GABAA mediated channel activity and has no
                                    significant affinity for benzodiazepine binding sites.
                        Frovatriptan is believed to act on extracerebral,
                                    intracranial arteries and to inhibit excessive dilation of these
                                    vessels in migraine. In anesthetized dogs and cats, intravenous
                                    administration of frovatriptan produced selective constriction
                                    of the carotid vascular bed and had no effect on blood pressure
                                    (both species) or coronary resistance (in dogs).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        Pharmacokinetics
                     
                     
                        Mean maximum blood concentrations (Cmax) in
                                    patients are achieved approximately 2 - 4 hours after
                                    administration of a single oral dose of frovatriptan 2.5 mg. The
                                    absolute bioavailability of an oral dose of frovatriptan 2.5 mg
                                    in healthy subjects is about 20% in males and 30% in females.
                                    Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of
                                    frovatriptan, but delays tmax by one hour.
                        Binding of frovatriptan to serum proteins is low
                                    (approximately 15%). Reversible binding to blood cells at
                                    equilibrium is approximately 60%, resulting in a blood:plasma
                                    ratio of about 2:1 in both males and females. The mean steady
                                    state volume of distribution of frovatriptan following
                                    intravenous administration of 0.8 mg is 4.2 L/kg in males and
                                    3.0 L/kg in females.
                        
                           In vitro,
                                    cytochrome P450 1A2 appears to be the principal enzyme
                                    involved in the metabolism of frovatriptan. Following
                                    administration of a single oral dose of radiolabeled
                                    frovatriptan 2.5 mg to healthy male and female subjects, 32% of
                                    the dose was recovered in urine and 62% in feces. Radiolabeled
                                    compounds excreted in urine were unchanged frovatriptan,
                                    hydroxylated frovatriptan, N-acetyl desmethyl frovatriptan,
                                    hydroxylated N-acetyl desmethyl frovatriptan and desmethyl
                                    frovatriptan, together with several other minor metabolites.
                                    Desmethyl frovatriptan has lower affinity for
                                    5-HT1B/1D receptors compared to the parent compound.
                                    The N-acetyl desmethyl metabolite has no significant affinity
                                    for 5-HT receptors. The activity of the other metabolites is
                                    unknown.
                        After an intravenous dose, mean clearance of frovatriptan
                                    was 220 and 130 mL/min in males and females, respectively. Renal
                                    clearance accounted for about 40% (82 mL/min) and 45% (60
                                    mL/min) of total clearance in males and females, respectively.
                                    The mean terminal elimination half-life of frovatriptan in both
                                    males and females is approximately 26 hours.
                        The pharmacokinetics of frovatriptan are similar in
                                    migraine patients and healthy subjects.

                              Mean AUC of frovatriptan was 1.5- to 2-fold
                                            higher in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 â€“
                                            77 years) compared to those in healthy younger subjects
                                            (age 21 - 37 years). There was no difference in
                                                tmax or t1/2 between the two
                                            populations.

                              There was no difference in the mean terminal
                                            elimination half-life of frovatriptan in males and
                                            females. Bioavailability was higher, and systemic
                                            exposure to frovatriptan was approximately 2-fold
                                            greater, in females than males, irrespective of
                                        age.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Renal Impairment:
                           
                           
                              Since less than 10% of FROVA is excreted in urine
                                            after an oral dose, it is unlikely that the exposure to
                                            frovatriptan will be affected by renal impairment. The
                                            pharmacokinetics of frovatriptan following a single oral
                                            dose of 2.5 mg was not different in patients with renal
                                            impairment (5 males and 6 females, creatinine clearance
                                            16 - 73 mL/min) and in subjects with normal renal
                                            function.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Hepatic Impairment:
                           
                           
                              There is no clinical or pharmacokinetic
                                            experience with FROVA in patients with severe hepatic
                                            impairment. The AUC in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh 5
                                            - 6) to moderate (Child-Pugh 7 - 9) hepatic impairment
                                            is about twice as high as the AUC in young, healthy
                                            subjects, but within the range found among normal
                                            elderly subjects.

                                            (isozymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4) in vitro at
                                            concentrations up to 250 to 500- fold higher than the
                                            highest blood concentrations observed in man at a dose
                                            of 2.5 mg. No induction of drug metabolizing enzymes was
                                            observed following multiple dosing of frovatriptan to
                                            rats or on addition to human hepatocytes in vitro. Although no
                                            clinical studies have been performed, it is unlikely
                                            that frovatriptan will affect the metabolism of
                                            co-administered drugs metabolized by these
                                        mechanisms.

                              The AUC and Cmax of frovatriptan (2 x
                                            2.5 mg dose) were reduced by approximately 25% when
                                            co-administered with ergotamine tartrate.

                        The efficacy of FROVA in the acute treatment of migraine
                                    headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind,
                                    placebo-controlled, outpatient trials. Two of these were
                                    dose-finding studies in which patients were randomized to
                                    receive doses of frovatriptan ranging from 0.5 - 40 mg. The
                                    three studies evaluating only one dose studied 2.5 mg. In these
                                    controlled short-term studies combined, patients were
                                    predominately female (88%) and Caucasian (94%) with a mean age
                                    of 42 years (range 18 - 69). Patients were instructed to treat a
                                    moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a
                                    reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to
                                    mild or no pain, was assessed for up to 24 hours after dosing.
                                    The associated symptoms nausea, vomiting, photophobia and
                                    phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was
                                    assessed for up to 24 hours post dose. In two of the trials a
                                    second dose of FROVA was provided after the initial treatment,
                                    to treat recurrence of the headache within 24 hours. Other
                                    medication, excluding other 5-HT1 agonists and
                                    ergotamine containing compounds, was permitted from 2 hours
                                    after the first dose of FROVA. The frequency and time to use of
                                    additional medications were also recorded.
                        In all five placebo-controlled trials, the percentage of
                                    patients achieving a headache response 2 hours after treatment
                                    was significantly greater for those taking FROVA compared to
                                    those taking placebo (Table 1).
                        Lower doses of frovatriptan (1 mg or 0.5 mg) were not
                                    effective at 2 hours. Higher doses (5 mg to 40 mg) of
                                    frovatriptan showed no added benefit over 2.5 mg but did cause a
                                    greater incidence of adverse events.
                        


                        



                           Comparisons of drug performance based
                                        upon results obtained in different clinical trials are never
                                        reliable. Because trials are conducted at different times,
                                        with different samples of patients, by different
                                        investigators, employing different criteria and/or different
                                        interpretations of the same criteria, under different
                                        conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative
                                        estimates of treatment response and the timing of response
                                        may be expected to vary considerably from study to
                                    study.

                                        (no or mild pain) following treatment with frovatriptan 2.5
                                        mg or placebo. The probabilities displayed are based on
                                        pooled data from four placebo-controlled trials described in
                                            Table 1(Trials 1, 3, 4 and 5). Patients who
                                        did not achieve a response were censored at 24
                                    hours.
                        
                        In patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia
                                    and phonophobia at baseline there was a decreased incidence of
                                    these symptoms in FROVA treated patients compared to placebo.
                                    The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or
                                    other medication for their migraine over the 24 hours following
                                    the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2.

                                        the initial dose of study medication based on the data from
                                        four placebo-controlled trials described in Table
                                        1 (Trials 1, 3, 4 and 5). The plot includes those
                                        patients who had a response to the initial dose and those
                                        who did not. The protocols did not permit remedication
                                        within 2 hours of the initial dose. 
                        
                        Efficacy was unaffected by a history of aura; gender;
