                  Molindone Hydrochloride has a pharmacological profile in laboratory animals which predominantly resembles that of other antipsychotic agents causing reduction of spontaneous locomotion and aggressiveness, suppression of a conditioned response and antagonism of the bizarre stereotyped behavior and hyperactivity induced by amphetamines. In addition, Molindone Hydrochloride antagonizes the depression caused by the tranquilizing agent tetrabenazine.
                  In human clinical studies an antipsychotic effect is achieved in the absence of muscle relaxing or incoordinating effects. Based on EEG studies, Molindone Hydrochloride exerts its effect on the ascending reticular activating system.
                  Human metabolic studies show Molindone Hydrochloride Tablets to be rapidly absorbed and metabolized when given orally. Unmetabolized drug reached a peak blood level at 1.5 hours. Pharmacological effect from a single oral dose persists for 24 to 36 hours. There are 36 recognized metabolites with less than 2 to 3% unmetabolized Molindone Hydrochloride Tablets being excreted in urine and feces.
