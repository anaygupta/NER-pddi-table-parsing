                  CYP 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers A pharmacokinetic interaction study of ketoconazole (400 mg/day), 
a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4, in 12 patients stabilized on buprenorphine and 
naloxone sublingual [8 mg (n=1) or 12 mg (n=5) or 16 mg (n=6)] resulted in 
increases in buprenorphine mean Cmax values (from 4.3 to 
9.8, 6.3 to 14.4 and 9 to 17.1) and mean AUC values (from 30.9 to 46.9, 41.9 to 
83.2 and 52.3 to 120) respectively. Subjects receiving buprenorphine HCl 
sublingual tablets or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets should be 
closely monitored and may require dose-reduction if inhibitors of CYP 3A4 such 
as azole antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., 
erythromycin) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir and 
saquinavir) are co-administered. The interaction of buprenorphine with CYP 3A4 
inducers has not been investigated; therefore it is recommended that patients 
receiving buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets or buprenorphine and naloxone 
sublingual tablets should be closely monitored if inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g. 
phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered (see WARNINGS).
