["A) PREDICTIONS ARE BASED ON BANZEL CONCENTRATIONS AT THE MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED DOSE OF BANZEL. B) MAXIMUM CHANGES PREDICTED TO BE IN CHILDREN AND IN PATIENTS WHO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVELS OF BANZEL, AS THE EFFECT OF RUFINAMIDE ON THESE AEDS IS CONCENTRATION-DEPENDENT. C) LARGER EFFECTS IN CHILDREN AT HIGH DOSES/CONCENTRATIONS OF AEDS. D) PHENOBARBITAL, PRIMIDONE AND PHENYTOIN WERE TREATED AS A SINGLE COVARIATE (PHENOBARBITAL-TYPE INDUCERS) TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF THESE AGENTS ON BANZEL CLEARANCE.
