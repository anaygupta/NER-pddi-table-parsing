                  Plenamine™ 15% Amino Acids Injection provides seventeen crystalline amino acids. This completely utilizable substrate promotes protein synthesis and wound healing and reduces the rate of protein catabolism.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     A. Total Parenteral Nutrition (Central Infusion)
                     
                        When enteral feeding is inadvisable, Plenamine™ 15% given by central venous infusion in combination with energy sources, vitamins, trace elements and electrolytes, will completely satisfy the requirements for weight maintenance or weight gain, depending upon the dose selected. The energy component in parenteral nutrition by central infusion may be derived solely from dextrose or may be provided by a combination of dextrose and intravenous fat emulsion. The addition of intravenous fat emulsion provides essential fatty acids and permits a dietary balance of fat and carbohydrate, at the same time offering the option of reducing the dextrose load and/or increasing the total caloric input. An adequate energy supply is essential for optimal utilization of amino acids.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     B. Total Parenteral Nutrition (Peripheral Infusion)
                     
                        Plenamine™ 15% can also be administered as part of a total parenteral nutrition program by peripheral vein when the enteral route is inadvisable and use of the central venous catheter is contraindicated.
                        Reduction of protein loss can be achieved by use of diluted Plenamine™ 15% in combination with dextrose or with dextrose and intravenous fat emulsion by peripheral infusion. Complete peripheral intravenous nutrition can be achieved in patients with low caloric requirements by a Plenamine™ 15% dextrose-fat regimen.
