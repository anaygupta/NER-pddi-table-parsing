                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        AZILECT functions as a selective, irreversible MAO-B inhibitor 
indicated for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The results of a 
clinical trial designed to examine the effects of Azilect on blood pressure when 
it is administered with increasing doses of tyramine indicates the functional 
selectivity can be incomplete when healthy subjects ingest large amounts of 
tyramine while receiving recommended doses of AZILECT. The selectivity for 
inhibiting MAO-B diminishes in a dose-related manner. 
                        MAO, a flavin-containing enzyme, is classified into two major molecular 
species, A and B, and is localized in mitochondrial membranes throughout the 
body in nerve terminals, brain, liver and intestinal mucosa. MAO regulates the 
metabolic degradation of catecholamines and serotonin in the CNS and peripheral 
tissues. MAO-B is the major form in the human brain. In ex 
vivo animal studies in brain, liver and intestinal tissues, rasagiline 
was shown to be a potent, irreversible monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) 
selective inhibitor. Rasagiline at the recommended therapeutic dose was also 
shown to be a potent and irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B in platelets. The 
precise mechanisms of action of rasagiline are unknown. One mechanism is 
believed to be related to its MAO-B inhibitory activity, which causes an 
increase in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. The elevated 
dopamine level and subsequent increased dopaminergic activity are likely to 
mediate rasagiline's beneficial effects seen in models of dopaminergic motor 
dysfunction. 
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Platelet MAO Activity in Clinical Studies
                        Studies in healthy subjects and in Parkinson's disease patients have shown 
that rasagiline inhibits platelet MAO-B irreversibly. The inhibition lasts at 
least 1 week after last dose. Almost 25-35% MAO-B inhibition was achieved after 
a single rasagiline dose of 1 mg/day and more than 55% of MAO-B inhibition was 
achieved after a single rasagiline dose of 2 mg/day. Over 90% inhibition was 
achieved 3 days after rasagiline daily dosing at 2 mg/day and this inhibition 
level was maintained 3 days post-dose. Multiple doses of rasagiline of 0.5, 1 
and 2 mg per day resulted in complete MAO-B inhibition. 
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Rasagiline in the range of 1-6 mg demonstrated a more than 
proportional increase in AUC, while Cmax was dose proportional. Rasagiline mean 
steady-state half life is 3 hours but there is no correlation of 
pharmacokinetics with its pharmacological effect because of its irreversible 
inhibition of MAO-B. 
                        
                        Absorption
                        Rasagiline is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentration (Cmax) in 
approximately 1 hour. The absolute bioavailability of rasagiline is about 
36%.
                        Food does not affect the Tmax of rasagiline, although Cmax and exposure (AUC) 
are decreased by approximately 60% and 20%, respectively, when the drug is taken 
with a high fat meal. Because AUC is not significantly affected, AZILECT can be 
administered with or without food [see Dosage 
and Administration (2)].
                        
                        Distribution
                        The mean volume of distribution at steady-state is 87 L, indicating that the 
tissue binding of rasagiline is in excess of plasma protein binding. Plasma 
protein binding ranges from 88-94% with mean extent of binding of 61-63% to 
human albumin over the concentration range of 1-100 ng/mL.
                        
                        Metabolism and Elimination
                        Rasagiline undergoes almost complete biotransformation in the liver prior to 
excretion. The metabolism of rasagiline proceeds through two main pathways: 
N-dealkylation and/or hydroxylation to yield 1-aminoindan (AI), 
3-hydroxy-N-propargyl-1 aminoindan (3-OH-PAI) and 3-hydroxy-1-aminoindan 
(3-OH-AI). In vitro experiments indicate that both 
routes of rasagiline metabolism are dependent on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
system, with CYP1A2 being the major isoenzyme involved in rasagiline metabolism. 
Glucuronide conjugation of rasagiline and its metabolites, with subsequent 
urinary excretion, is the major elimination pathway.
                        After oral administration of 14C-labeled rasagiline, 
elimination occurred primarily via urine and secondarily via feces (62% of total 
dose in urine and 7% of total dose in feces over 7 days), with a total 
calculated recovery of 84% of the dose over a period of 38 days. Less than 1% of 
rasagiline was excreted as unchanged drug in urine.

                           Hepatic Impairment
                        
                        Following repeat dose administration (7 days) of rasagiline (1 mg/day) in 
subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-6), AUC and Cmax were 
increased by 2 fold and 1.4 fold, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. In 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7-9), AUC and Cmax 
were increased by 7 fold and 2 fold, respectively, compared to healthy subjects 
[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and 
Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
                        
                        
                           Renal Impairment
                        
                        Following repeat dose administration (8 days) of rasagiline (1 mg/day) in 
subjects with moderate renal impairment, rasagiline exposure (AUC) was similar 
to rasagiline exposure in healthy subjects, while the major metabolite 1-AI 
exposure (AUC) was increased 1.5- fold in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment, compared to healthy subjects. Because 1-AI is not an MAO inhibitor, 
no dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild and moderate renal 
impairment. Data are not available for patients with severe renal 
impairment.

                        Since age has little influence on rasagiline pharmacokinetics, it can be 
administered at the recommended dose in the elderly (â‰¥ 65 years).

                        AZILECT has not been investigated in patients below 18 years of age.

                        The pharmacokinetic profile of rasagiline is similar in men and women.

                           [see Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Drug 
Interactions (7.9)].
                        
                        
                           Levodopa 
                        
                        Data from population pharmacokinetic studies comparing rasagiline clearance 
in the presence and absence of levodopa have given conflicting results. Although 
there may be some increase in rasagiline blood levels in the presence of 
levodopa, the effect is modest and rasagiline dosing need not be modified in the 
presence of levodopa. 
                        
                        
                           Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of 
AZILECT
                        
                        
                           In vitro metabolism studies showed that CYP1A2 was 
the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of rasagiline. There is the 
potential for inhibitors of this enzyme to alter AZILECT clearance when 
coadministered [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions 
(5.2)]. 
                        
                        
                           Ciprofloxacin: When ciprofloxacin, an 
inhibitor of CYP1A2, was administered to healthy volunteers (n=12) at 500 mg 
(BID) with rasagiline at 2 mg/day, the AUC of rasagiline increased by 83% and 
there was no change in the elimination half life [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings 
and Precautions (5.2)]. 
                        
                        
                           Theophylline: Coadministration of 
rasagiline 1 mg/day and theophylline, a substrate of CYP1A2, up to 500 mg twice 
daily to healthy subjects (n=24) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either 
drug. 
                        
                        
                           Antidepressants: Severe CNS toxicity 
(occasionally fatal) associated with hyperpyrexia as part of a serotonin 
syndrome, has been reported with combined treatment of an antidepressant (e.g., 
from one of many classes including tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, 
SSRIs, SNRIs, triazolopyridine antidepressants) and non-selective MAOI or a 
selective MAO-B inhibitor [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1)]. 
                        
                        
                           Effect of AZILECT on Other Drugs
                        
                        No additional in vivo trials have investigated the 
effect of AZILECT on other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme 
system. In vitro studies showed that rasagiline at a 
concentration of 1mcg/ml (equivalent to a level that is 160 times the average 
Cmax ~ 5.9-8.5 ng/mL in Parkinson's disease patients after 1 mg rasagiline 
multiple dosing) did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4 and CYP4A. These results indicate that 
rasagiline is unlikely to cause any clinically significant interference with 
substrates of these enzymes.
