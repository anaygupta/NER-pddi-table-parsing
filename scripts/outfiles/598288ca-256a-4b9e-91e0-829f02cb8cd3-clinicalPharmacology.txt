                  The plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin were not measured 
following three drops of otic suspension administration because the systemic 
exposure to ciprofloxacin is expected to be below the limit of quantitation of 
the assay (0.05 µg/mL).
                  Similarly, the predicted Cmax of hydrocortisone is within the range of 
endogenous hydrocortisone concentration (0-150 ng/mL), and therefore can not be 
differentiated from the endogenous cortisol.
                  Preclinical studies have shown that CIPRO® HC OTIC was 
not toxic to the guinea pig cochlea when administered intratympanically twice 
daily for 30 days and was only weakly irritating to rabbit skin upon repeated 
exposure.
                  Hydrocortisone has been added to aid in the resolution of the inflammatory 
response accompanying bacterial infection.
                  
                  MicrobiologyCiprofloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of 
gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. The bactericidal action of 
ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme, DNA gyrase, which is 
needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Cross-resistance has been observed 
between ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. There is generally no 
cross-resistance between ciprofloxacin and other classes of antibacterial agents 
such as beta-lactams or aminoglycosides.
                  Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the 
following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections of acute 
otitis externa as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE
