                  The opiates act by enhancing tone in the long segments of longitudinal muscle and by inhibiting propulsive contraction of both circular and longitudinal muscles.
Clinical evidence indicates that the analgesic activity of opium preparations is due to their morphine content. Relatively small doses that do not produce significant analgesia are effective in controlling diarrhea. The papaverine content of the mixed alkaloids is too small to have demonstrable spasmolytic activity.
Following oral administration, morphine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is rapidly metabolized following oral administration, however, and plasma levels of unconjugated morphine are lower than those achieved after parenteral administration. Like other narcotic analgesics, opium preparations are metabolized in the liver. Morphine undergoes conjugation with glucuronic acid at the 3-hydroxyl group. Secondary conjugation may also occur at the 6-hydroxyl group to form the 3,6-diglucuronide. Morphine is excreted in the urine mainly as morphine-3-glucuronide and smaller amounts of morphine-3,6-diglucuronide and unchanged drug. Approximately 75% of a dose of morphine is excreted in the urine within 48 hours.
