                     7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs
                     
                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and IMITREX Nasal Spray within 24Â hours of each other is contraindicated.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors
                     
                        MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by up to 7-fold. Therefore, the use of IMITREX Nasal Spray in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists
                     
                        Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of IMITREX Nasal Spray and other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome
                     
                        Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
