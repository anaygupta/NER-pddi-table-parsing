                     In vitro studies suggest limited potential for CYP450-related metabolic drug interactions, thus no formal drug interaction studies have been performed with TUDORZA PRESSAIR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Anticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications.  Avoid administrations of TUDORZA PRESSAIR with other anticholinergic-containing drugs.

                     7.1 Sympathomimetics, Methylxanthines, Steroids
                     
                        In clinical studies, concurrent administration of aclidinium bromide and other drugs commonly used in the treatment of COPD including sympathomimetics (short-acting beta2 agonists), methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids showed no increases in adverse drug reactions.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Anticholinergics
                     
                        There is a potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications.  Therefore, avoid coadministration of TUDORZA PRESSAIR with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic effects.
