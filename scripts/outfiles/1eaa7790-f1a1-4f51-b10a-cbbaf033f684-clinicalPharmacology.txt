                        Ibuprofen's mechanism of action, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.  Caldolor possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                      12.3 Pharmacokinetics

                     
                        Ibuprofen is a racemic mixture of [-]R- and [+]S-isomers. In vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the [+]S-isomer is responsible for clinical activity. The [-]R-form, while thought to be pharmacologically inactive, is slowly and incompletely (~60%) interconverted into the active [+]S species in adults. The [-]R-isomer serves as a circulating reservoir to maintain levels of active drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters of Caldolor determined in a study with volunteers are presented below.

                        


                        


Ibuprofen, like most NSAIDs, is highly protein bound (>99% bound at 20 mcg/mL). Protein binding is saturable, and at concentrations >20 mcg/mL binding is nonlinear. Based on oral dosing data, there is an age- or fever-related change in volume of distribution for ibuprofen.
