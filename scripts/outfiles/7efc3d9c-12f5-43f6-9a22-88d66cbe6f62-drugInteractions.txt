                        Specific drug interaction studies have not been
                                    conducted. Magnesium-containing antacids and Hectorol should not
                                    be used concomitantly because such use may lead to the
                                    development of hypermagnesemia (see

                           ). Although not examined specifically, enzyme inducers
                                    (such as glutethimide and phenobarbital) may affect the
                                    25-hydroxylation of Hectorol and may necessitate dosage
                                    adjustments. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole
                                    and erythromycin) may inhibit the 25-hydroxylation of Hectorol.
                                    Hence, formation of the active Hectorol moiety may be
                                    hindered.
