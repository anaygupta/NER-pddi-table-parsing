                  The pharmacologic and clinical properties of oxytocin are
                            identical with those of naturally occurring oxytocin principle of the
                            posterior lobe of pituitary. Oxytocin exerts a selective action on the
                            smooth musculature of the uterus, particularly toward the end of
                            pregnancy, during labor, and immediately following delivery. Oxytocin
                            stimulates rhythmic contractions of the uterus, increases the frequency
                            of existing contractions, and raises the tone of the uterine
                            musculature.
                  When given in appropriate doses during pregnancy, oxytocin is
                            capable of eliciting graded increases in uterine motility from a
                            moderate increase in the rate and force of spontaneous motor activity to
                            sustained titanic contraction. The sensitivity of the uterus to oxytocic
                            activity increases progressively throughout pregnancy until term when it
                            is maximal.
                  Oxytocin is distributed throughout the extracellular fluid. Small
                            amounts of this drug probably reach the fetal circulation. Oxytocin has
                            a plasma half-life of about 3 to 5 minutes. Following parenteral
                            administration, uterine response occurs within 3 to 5 minutes and
                            persists for 2 to 3 hours. Its rapid removal from plasma is accomplished
                            largely by the kidney and the liver. Only small amounts oxytocin are
                            excreted in the urine unchanged.
