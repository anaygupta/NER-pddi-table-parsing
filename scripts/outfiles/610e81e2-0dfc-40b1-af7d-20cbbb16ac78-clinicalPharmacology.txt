                  Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, USP. Dosing in the fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin. While amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, USP can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate potassium when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state. In 1 study, the relative bioavailability of clavulanate was reduced when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, USP was dosed at 30 and 150 minutes after the start of a high–fat breakfast. The safety and efficacy of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, USP have been established in clinical trials where amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, USP was taken without regard to meals.

                     
Oral administration of single doses of 400-mg chewable tablets and 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL suspension to 28 adult volunteers yielded comparable pharmacokinetic data:
                  


                  



                     †Administered at the start of a light meal.

                     ‡Mean values of 28 normal volunteers. Peak concentrations occurred approximately 1 hour after the dose.

                     
Oral administration of 5 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL oral suspension or the equivalent dose of 10 mL amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL oral suspension provides average peak serum concentrations approximately 1 hour after dosing of 6.9 mcg/mL for amoxicillin and 1.6 mcg/mL for clavulanic acid. The areas under the serum concentration curves obtained during the first 4 hours after dosing were 12.6 mcg.hr/mL for amoxicillin and 2.9 mcg.hr/mL for clavulanic acid when 5 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg/ 62.5 mg per 5 mL oral suspension or equivalent dose of 10 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL oral suspension was administered to adult volunteers. One amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet or two amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 125 mg/31.25 mg chewable tablets are equivalent to 5 mL amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspension and provide similar serum levels of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. 
                  Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension are similar to those produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone. The half-life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension is 1.3 hours and that of clavulanic acid is 1.0 hour. Time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.0 mcg/mL for amoxicillin has been shown to be similar after corresponding q12h and q8h dosing regimens of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension in adults and children.
                  Approximately 50% to 70% of the amoxicillin and approximately 25% to 40% of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in urine during the first 6 hours after administration of 10 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL oral suspension.
                  Concurrent administration of probenecid delays amoxicillin excretion but does not delay renal excretion of clavulanic acid.
                  Neither component in amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension is highly protein-bound; clavulanic acid has been found to be approximately 25% bound to human serum and amoxicillin approximately 18% bound.
                  Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid. The results of experiments involving the administration of clavulanic acid to animals suggest that this compound, like amoxicillin, is well distributed in body tissues.
                  Two hours after oral administration of a single 35 mg/kg dose of suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium to fasting children, average concentrations of 3 mcg/mL of amoxicillin and 0.5 mcg/mL of clavulanic acid were detected in middle ear effusions.

                        Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Amoxicillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by β-lactamases, and therefore, the spectrum of activity does not include organisms which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a β-lactam, structurally related to the penicillins, which possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of β-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. In particular, it has good activity against the clinically important plasmid–mediated β-lactamases frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance.

                           
The formulation of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension protects amoxicillin from degradation by β-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibiotic spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. Thus, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension possesses the distinctive properties of a broad-spectrum antibiotic and a β-lactamase inhibitor.

                                       †† Staphylococci which are susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid but resistant to methicillin/oxacillin must be considered as resistant.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    For S. pneumoniae from non-meningitis sources:
                                 
                                 
                                    Isolates should be tested using amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and the following criteria should be used:
                                    


                                    


Note: These interpretive criteria are based on the recommended doses for respiratory tract infections.
                                    A report of “Susceptible” indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable. A report of “Intermediate” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of “Resistant” indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.
                                    Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium powder should provide the following MIC values:
                                    


                                 



                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Diffusion Techniques:
                              
                           
                           
                              Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure2 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanate potassium) to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

                                 
Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30-mcg amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanate potassium) disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

                                       
As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30 mcg amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanate potassium) disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory quality control strains:
