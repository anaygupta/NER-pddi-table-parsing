                     12.1   Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor.  HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from acetylated lysine residues in histones, resulting in the modulation of gene expression.  HDACs also deacetylate non-histone proteins, such as transcription factors. In vitro, romidepsin causes the accumulation of acetylated histones, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of some cancer cell lines with IC50 values in the nanomolar range.  The mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of romidepsin observed in nonclinical and clinical studies has not been fully characterized.

                           Cardiac Electrophysiology
                        
                        The effect of romidepsin on the heart-rate corrected QTc/QTcF was evaluated in 26 subjects with advanced malignancies given romidepsin at doses of 14 mg/m2 as a 4-hour intravenous infusion, and at doses of 8, 10 or 12 mg/m2 as a 1–hour infusion.  Patients received premedications with antiemetics.  No large changes in the mean QTc interval (> 20 milliseconds) from baseline based on Fridericia correction method were detected in the trial.  Small increase in mean QT interval (< 10 milliseconds) and mean QT interval increase between 10 to 20 milliseconds cannot be excluded because of the limitations in the trial design. 
                        Romidepsin was associated with a delayed concentration-dependent increase in heart rate in patients with advanced cancer with a maximum mean increase in heart rate of 20 beats per minute occurring at the 6 hour time point after start of romidepsin infusion for patients receiving 14 mg/m2 as a 4-hour infusion.

                              Absorption
                              Romidepsin exhibited linear pharmacokinetics across doses ranging from 1.0 to 24.9 mg/m2 when administered intravenously over 4 hours in patients with advanced cancers.
                              In patients with T-cell lymphomas who received 14 mg/m2 of romidepsin intravenously over a 4-hour period on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, geometric mean values of the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-inf) were 377 ng/mL and 1549 ng*hr/mL, respectively.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                           
                              Distribution
                              Romidepsin is highly protein bound in plasma (92% to 94%) over the concentration range of 50 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL with α1-acid-glycoprotein (AAG) being the principal binding protein. Romidepsin is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1). 
                              In vitro, romidepsin accumulates into human hepatocytes via an unknown active uptake process.  Romidepsin is not a substrate of the following uptake transporters: BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT2. In addition, romidepsin is not an inhibitor of BCRP, MRP2, MDR1 or OAT3. Although romidepsin did not inhibit OAT1, OCT2, and OATP1B3 at concentrations seen clinically (1 μmol/L), modest inhibition was observed at 10 µmol/L. Romidepsin was found to be an inhibitor of BSEP and OATP1B1.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                           
                              Metabolism
                              Romidepsin undergoes extensive metabolism in vitro primarily by CYP3A4 with minor contribution from CYP3A5, CYP1A1, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19.  At therapeutic concentrations, romidepsin did not competitively inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 in vitro.
                              At therapeutic concentrations, romidepsin did not cause notable induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in vitro. Therefore, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions are unlikely to occur due to CYP450 induction or inhibition by romidepsin when co-administered with CYP450 substrates.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                           
                              Excretion
                              Following 4-hour intravenous administration of romidepsin at 14 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle in patients with T-cell lymphomas, the terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 3 hours.  No accumulation of plasma concentration of romidepsin was observed after repeated dosing.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                           
                              Drug Interactions
                              Ketoconazole: A drug interaction clinical trial with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, was conducted in patients with advanced cancer.  Following co-administration of 8 mg/m2 ISTODAX (4-hour infusion) with ketoconazole, the overall romidepsin exposure was increased by approximately 25% and 10% for AUC0-∞ and Cmax, respectively, compared to romidepsin alone, and the difference in AUC0-∞  between the 2 treatments was statistically significant.  Co-administration of ketoconazole slightly decreased the romidepsin clearance and volume of distribution, but did not have a statistically significant effect on peak exposure (Cmax) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].
                              
                              Rifampin:  A drug interaction clinical trial with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, was conducted in patients with advanced cancer.  Following co-administration of 14 mg/m2 ISTODAX (4-hour infusion) with rifampin, the overall romidepsin exposure was unexpectedly increased by approximately 80% and 60% for AUC0-∞ and Cmax, respectively, compared to romidepsin alone, and the difference between the 2 treatments was statistically significant.  Co-administration of rifampin decreased the romidepsin clearance and volume of distribution by 44% and 52%, respectively. The increase in exposure seen after co-administration with rifampin is likely due to rifampin's inhibition of an undetermined hepatic uptake process that is predominant for the disposition of ISTODAX [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

                              Effect of Age, Gender or Race
                              The population pharmacokinetic analysis of romidepsin showed that age, gender, or race (white vs. black) did not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of romidepsin.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                           
                              Effect of Hepatic Impairment
                              No dedicated hepatic impairment study has been conducted for ISTODAX.  The population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that mild hepatic impairment [total bilirubin (TB) ≤upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >ULN; or TB >1.0x - 1.5x ULN and any AST] had no significant influence on romidepsin pharmacokinetics.  As the effect of  moderate (TB >1.5x - 3x ULN and any AST)  and severe (TB >3x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of romidepsin is unknown, patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment should be treated with caution [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
                              
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                           
                              Effect of Renal Impairment
                              No dedicated renal impairment study has been conducted for ISTODAX.  The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that romidepsin pharmacokinetics were not affected by mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 - 80 mL/min), moderate (estimated creatinine clearance 30 - 50 mL/min), or severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment.  Nonetheless, the effect of end-stage renal disease on romidepsin pharmacokinetics has not been studied.  Thus, patients with end-stage renal disease should be treated with caution [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].
