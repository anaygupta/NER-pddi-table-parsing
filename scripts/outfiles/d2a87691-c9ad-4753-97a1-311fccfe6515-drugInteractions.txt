                        The concomitant use of known strong CYP 3A4 inducers may reduce drug levels of vandetanib and should be avoided (7.1).  No clinically significant drug interaction was shown with vandetanib and the potent CYP 3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole (7.2). The administration of vandetanib with agents that may prolong the QT interval should be avoided (5.11) 
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 CYP3A4 Inducers
                     
                        Drugs that are CYP3A4 inducers can alter vandetanib plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of known strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided while receiving vandetanib therapy. St. Johnâ€™s Wort may decrease vandetanib exposure unpredictably and should be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)and Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

                        In healthy subjects, no clinically significant interaction was shown between vandetanib and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole.
