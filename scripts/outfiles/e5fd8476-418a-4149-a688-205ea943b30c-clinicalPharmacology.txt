                  ANASPAZ inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sino-atrial node, the atrioventricular node and exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action in the autonomic ganglia. ANASPAZ inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. ANASPAZ also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. ANASPAZ is absorbed totally and completely by sublingual administration as well as oral administration. Once absorbed, ANASPAZ disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of ANASPAZ is 3.5 hours and the majority of drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours, with a small amount hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. ANASPAZ passes the blood-brain and placental barriers.
