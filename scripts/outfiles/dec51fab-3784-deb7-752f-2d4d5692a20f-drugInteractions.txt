                     Drugs That Can Prolong the QT/QTc Interval Concomitant use of these drugs and TRISENOX may increase the risk of serious QT/QTc interval prolongation. Discontinue or replace with an alternative drug that does not prolong the QT/QTc interval while patient is using TRISENOX. Monitor ECGs more frequently in patients when it is not feasible to avoid concomitant use.
