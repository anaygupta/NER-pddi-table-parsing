                  The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is
                            unknown. DIURIL does not usually affect normal blood
                            pressure.
                  DIURIL affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte
                            reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosage all thiazides are
                            approximately equal in their diuretic efficacy.
                  DIURIL increases excretion of sodium and chloride in
                            approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some
                            loss of potassium and bicarbonate.
                  After oral use diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4
                            hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. 
                  
                     Pharmacokinetics and
                                    Metabolism
                  
                  DIURIL is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the
                            kidney. The plasma half-life of chlorothiazide is 45-120 minutes. After
                            oral doses, 10-15 percent of the dose is excreted unchanged in the
                            urine. Chlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain
                            barrier and is excreted in breast milk.
