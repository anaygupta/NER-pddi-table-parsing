            AbsorptionCiprofloxacin given as an oral tablet
            is rapidly and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral
            administration. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 70% with no
            substantial loss by first pass metabolism. Ciprofloxacin maximum serum
            concentrations and area under the curve are shown in the chart for the 250 mg to
            1000 mg dose range.    

                  

Maximum
            serum concentrations are attained 1 to 2 hours after oral dosing. Mean
            concentrations 12 hours after dosing with 250, 500, or 750 mg are 0.1, 0.2, and
            0.4 mcg/mL, respectively. The serum elimination half-life in subjects with
            normal renal function is approximately 4 hours. Serum concentrations increase
            proportionately with doses up to 1000 mg.




                  
A 500 mg oral dose given every
            12 hours has been shown to produce an area under the serum concentration time
            curve (AUC) equivalent to that produced by an intravenous infusion of 400 mg
            ciprofloxacin given over 60 minutes every 12 hours. A 750 mg oral dose given
            every 12 hours has been shown to produce an AUC at steady-state equivalent to
            that produced by an intravenous infusion of 400 mg given over 60 minutes every 8
            hours. A 750 mg oral dose results in a Cmax similar to
            that observed with a 400 mg I.V. dose. A 250 mg oral dose given every 12 hours
            produces an AUC equivalent to that produced by an infusion of 200 mg
            ciprofloxacin given every 12 hours.

                  cAUC 24h=AUC0-8h x 3DistributionThe binding of ciprofloxacin to
            serum proteins is 20 to 40% which is not likely to be high enough to cause
            significant protein binding interactions with other drugs.

                  
After oral
            administration, ciprofloxacin is widely distributed throughout the body. Tissue
            concentrations often exceed serum concentrations in both men and women,
            particularly in genital tissue including the prostate. Ciprofloxacin is present
            in active form in the saliva, nasal and bronchial secretions, mucosa of the
            sinuses, sputum, skin blister fluid, lymph, peritoneal fluid, bile, and
            prostatic secretions. Ciprofloxacin has also been detected in lung, skin, fat,
            muscle, cartilage, and bone. The drug diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid
            (CSF); however, CSF concentrations are generally less than 10% of peak serum
            concentrations. Low levels of the drug have been detected in the aqueous and
            vitreous humors of the eye.  
MetabolismFour metabolites have been identified
            in human urine which together account for approximately 15% of an oral dose. The
            metabolites have antimicrobial activity, but are less active than unchanged
            ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2
            (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs
            primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of
            these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the
            coadministered drug (see

            ).ExcretionThe serum elimination half-life in
            subjects with normal renal function is approximately 4 hours. Approximately 40
            to 50% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged
            drug. After a 250 mg oral dose, urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin usually
            exceed 200 μg/mL during the first two hours and are approximately 30 μg/mL at 8
            to 12 hours after dosing. The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually
            complete within 24 hours after dosing. The renal clearance of ciprofloxacin,
            which is approximately 300 mL/minute, exceeds the normal glomerular filtration
            rate of 120 mL/minute. Thus, active tubular secretion would seem to play a
            significant role in its elimination. Co-administration of probenecid with
            ciprofloxacin results in about a 50% reduction in the ciprofloxacin renal
            clearance and a 50% increase in its concentration in the systemic circulation.
            Although bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum
            concentrations after oral dosing, only a small amount of the dose administered
            is recovered from the bile as unchanged drug. An additional 1 to 2% of the dose
            is recovered from the bile in the form of metabolites. Approximately 20 to 35%
            of an oral dose is recovered from the feces within 5 days after dosing. This may
            arise from either biliary clearance or transintestinal elimination.
