                        The following drug interactions may occur with
Potassium Citrate:
                        
                           Potassium-sparing diuretics: concomitant administration
should be avoided since the simultaneous administration of these agents
can produce severe hyperkalemia 
                                 (7.1)
                              
                           
                           Drugs that slow gastrointestinal transit time: These agents
(such as anticholinergics) can be expected to increase the gastrointestinal
irritation produced by potassium salts

                           Potassium-sparing Diuretics: Concomitant administration of Potassium Citrate and a potassium-sparing
diuretic (such as triamterene, spironolactone or amiloride) should
be avoided since the simultaneous administration of these agents can
produce severe hyperkalemia.
