                  The antidiuretic action of vasopressin is ascribed to increasing reabsorption of water by the renal tubules.
                  Vasopressin can cause contraction of smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract and of all parts of the vascular bed, especially the capillaries, small arterioles and venules with less effect on the smooth musculature of the large veins.  The direct effect on the contractile elements is neither antagonized by adrenergic blocking agents nor prevented by vascular denervation.
                  Following subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of vasopressin injection, the duration of antidiuretic activity is variable but effects are usually maintained for 2 to 8 hours.
                  The majority of a dose of vasopressin is metabolized and rapidly destroyed in the liver and kidneys.  Vasopressin has a plasma half-life of about 10 to 20 minutes.  Approximately 5% of a subcutaneous dose of vasopressin is excreted in urine unchanged after 4 hours.
