                        The potential for additive bone marrow toxicity of                                         QUADRAMET® with chemotherapy or external                                     beam radiation has not been studied.                                     QUADRAMET® should not be given concurrently                                     with chemotherapy or external beam radiation therapy unless the                                     benefit outweighs the risks. QUADRAMET®                                     should not be given after either of these treatments until there                                     has been time for adequate marrow recovery.                                         (See Warnings Section).
