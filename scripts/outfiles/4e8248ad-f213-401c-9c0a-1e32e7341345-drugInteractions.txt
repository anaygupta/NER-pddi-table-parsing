                  Use of Karbinal ER is contraindicated in patients who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines.
                  Avoid use of Karbinal ER with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.) due to additive effects.
