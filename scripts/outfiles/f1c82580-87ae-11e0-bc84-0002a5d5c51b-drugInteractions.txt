                           Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Fluconazole:  Reduce, interrupt, or discontinue Jakafi doses as recommended. (2.3) (7.1) Avoid use of Jakafi with fluconazole doses greater than 200 mg.

                        Ruxolitinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9.
                        
                           CYP3A4 inhibitors: The Cmax and AUC of ruxolitinib increased 33% and 91%, respectively following concomitant administration with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole in healthy subjects. Concomitant administration with mild or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors did not result in an exposure change requiring intervention [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].
                        When administering Jakafi with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, consider dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
                        
                           Fluconazole: The AUC of ruxolitinib is predicted to increase by approximately 100% to 300% following concomitant administration with the combined CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitor fluconazole at doses of 100 mg to 400 mg once daily, respectively [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].
                        Avoid the concomitant use of Jakafi with fluconazole doses of greater than 200 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
                        
                           CYP3A4 inducers: The Cmax and AUC of ruxolitinib decreased 32% and 61%, respectively, following concomitant administration with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin in healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended; however, monitor patients frequently and adjust the Jakafi dose based on safety and efficacy [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].
