                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET.

                        A single 32 mg dose (1.3 times the recommended daily dose) of lenvatinib did not prolong the QT/QTc interval in a thorough QT study in healthy subjects. However, QT prolongation was observed in Study 1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].  
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        
                           Absorption: After oral administration of LENVIMA, time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) typically occurred from 1 to 4 hours post-dose. Administration with food did not affect the extent of absorption, but decreased the rate of absorption and delayed the median Tmax from 2 hours to 4 hours.
                        In patients with solid tumors administered single and multiple doses of LENVIMA once daily, the maximum lenvatinib plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration- time curve (AUC) increased proportionally over the dose range of 3.2 to 32 mg with a median accumulation index of 0.96 (20 mg) to 1.54 (6.4 mg).  
                        
                           Distribution: In vitro binding of lenvatinib to human plasma proteins ranged from 98% to 99% (0.3 – 30 μg/mL). In vitro, the lenvatinib blood-to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.589 to 0.608 (0.1 – 10 μg/mL). 
                        Based on in vitro data, lenvatinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP but not a substrate for organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, or the bile salt export pump (BSEP).
                        
                           Elimination: Plasma concentrations declined bi-exponentially following Cmax. The terminal elimination half-life of lenvatinib was approximately 28 hours. 
                        
                           Metabolism: CYP3A is one of the main metabolic enzymes of lenvatinib. The main metabolic pathways for lenvatinib in humans were identified as enzymatic (CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase) and non-enzymatic processes. 
                        
                           Excretion: Ten days after a single administration of radiolabeled lenvatinib to 6 patients with solid tumors, approximately 64% and 25% of the radiolabel were eliminated in the feces and urine, respectively. 
                        
                           Specific Populations:
                        
                           Renal Impairment
                        
                        The pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 24 mg dose were evaluated in subjects with mild (CLcr 60-89 mL/min), moderate (CLcr 30-59 mL/min), and severe (CLcr <30 mL/min) renal impairment, and compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with end stage renal disease were not studied. After a single 24 mg oral dose of LENVIMA, the AUC0-inf for subjects with renal impairment were similar compared to those for healthy subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 
                        
                           Hepatic Impairment
                        
                        The pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 10 mg dose of LENVIMA were evaluated in subjects with mild (Child Pugh A) and moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of a single 5 mg dose were evaluated in subjects with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, the dose-adjusted AUC0-inf of lenvatinib for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were 119%, 107%, and 180%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].  
                        
                           Effects of Age, Sex, and Race
                        
                        Based on a population PK analysis, age, sex, and race did not have a significant effect on apparent clearance (Cl/F) of lenvatinib.

                           Effect of Other Drugs on Lenvatinib
                        
                        
                           CYP3A, P-gp, and BCRP Inhibitors: Ketoconazole (400 mg for 18 days) increased lenvatinib (administered as a single dose on Day 5) AUC by 15% and Cmax by 19% in a dedicated clinical trial. 
                        
                           P-gp Inhibitors: Rifampicin (600 mg as a single dose) increased lenvatinib (24 mg as a single dose)AUC by 31% and Cmax by 33% in a dedicated clinical trial. 
                        
                           CYP3A and P-gp Inducers: Rifampicin (600 mg administered daily for 21 days) decreased lenvatinib (a single 24 mg administered on Day 15) AUC by 18% in a dedicated clinical trial. The Cmax was unchanged. 
                        
                           Effect of Lenvatinib on Other Drugs
                        
                        
                           CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 Substrates: There is no projected significant drug-drug interaction risk between lenvatinib and midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) or repaglinide (a CYP2C8 substrate).
                        
                           In Vitro Studies with CYP or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) Substrates: Lenvatinib inhibits CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A, but an increase in lenvatinib exposure that impacts safety is unlikely. Lenvatinib does not inhibit CYP2A6 and CYP2E1.
                        Lenvatinib induces CYP3A, but a decrease in lenvatinib exposure that impacts efficacy is unlikely. Lenvatinib does not induce CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9.
                        Lenvatinib directly inhibits UGT1A1 and UGT1A4. The clinical implication of this finding is unknown. Lenvatinib shows little or no inhibition on UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, or aldehyde oxidase. 
                        Lenvatinib does not induce UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7.
                        
                           In Vitro Studies with Drug Transporter System Substrates: Lenvatinib inhibits OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, and BSEP. The clinical implication of this finding is unknown. Lenvatinib shows little or no inhibition on OATP1B3.
