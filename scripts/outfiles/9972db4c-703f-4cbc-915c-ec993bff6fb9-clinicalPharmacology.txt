                  SULFAMYLON Cream, applied topically, produces a marked reduction in the bacterial population present in the avascular tissues of second- and third-degree burns. Reduction in bacterial growth after application of SULFAMYLON Cream has also been reported to permit spontaneous healing of deep partial-thickness burns, and thus prevent conversion of burn wounds from partial-thickness to full-thickness. It should be noted, however, that delayed eschar separation has occurred in some cases.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Absorption and Metabolism
                     
                        Applied topically, SULFAMYLON Cream diffuses through devascularized areas, is absorbed, and rapidly converted to a metabolite (ρ-carboxybenzenesulfonamide) which is cleared through the kidneys. SULFAMYLON is active in the presence of pus and serum, and its activity is not altered by changes in the acidity of the environment.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Antibacterial Activity
                     
                        SULFAMYLON exerts bacteriostatic action against many gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and certain strains of anaerobes.
