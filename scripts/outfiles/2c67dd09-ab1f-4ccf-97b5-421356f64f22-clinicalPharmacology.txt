                     Mechanism of Action:
                     
                        The mechanism of action of ciclopirox has been investigated using various in vitro and in vivo infection models. One in vitro  study suggested that ciclopirox acts by chelation of polyvalent cations (Fe+3 or Al+3) resulting in the inhibition of the metal-dependent enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of peroxides within the fungal cell. The clinical significance of this observation is not 
known.
