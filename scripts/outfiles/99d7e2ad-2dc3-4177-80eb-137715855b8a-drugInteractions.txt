                   I. Due to the competition of salicylate with other drugs for binding to serum albumin the following drug interactions may occur:
                   DRUG                                DESCRIPTION OF INTERACTION 
                  Sulfonylureas                     Hypoglycemia potentiated.
                   Methotrexate                     Decreases tubular reabsorption; clinical toxicity from methotrexate can result. 
                  Oral Anticoagulants            Increased bleeding.
                  II. Drugs changing salicylate levels by altering renal tubular reabsorption:
                   DRUG                                DESCRIPTION OF INTERACTION 
                  Corticosteroids                   Decreases plasma salicylate level; tapering doses of steroids may promote salicylism. 
                  Acidifying Agents                Increases plasmasalicylate level. 
                  Alkalizing Agents                Decreased plasma salicylate levels.
                  III. Drugs with complicated interactions with salicylates: 
                  DRUG                                DESCRIPTION OF INTERACTION
                   Heparin                             Salicylate decreases platelet adhesiveness and interferes with hemostasis in heparin-treated patients. 
                  Pyrazinamide                     Inhibits pyrazinamideinduced hyperuricemia. 
                  Uricosuric Agents               Effect of probenemide, sulfinpyrazone and phenylbutazone inhibited.
                  The following alterations of laboratory tests have been reported during salicylate therapy:
                   LABORATORY TESTS           EFFECT OF SALICYLATES 
                  Thyroid Function                Decreased PBI;  increased T3 uptake. 
                  Urinary Sugar                     False negative with glucose oxidase; false positive with Clinitest with high-dose salicylate therapy (2-5g q.d.).
                   5-Hydroxyindole acetic acid     False negative with fluorometric test.
                  Acetone,                             False positive FeCl3 in Gerhardt reaction; red color persists with boiling. ketone bodies
                   17-OH corticosteroids          False reduced values with >4.8g q.d. salicylate.
                    Vanilmandelic acid              False reduced values.
                   Uric acid                             May increase or decrease depending on dose.
                   Prothrombin                       Decreased levels; slightly increased prothrombin time.
