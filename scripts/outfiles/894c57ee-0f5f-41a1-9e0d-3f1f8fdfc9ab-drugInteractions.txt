                        Phenobarbital in combination with alcohol, tranquilizers, and other central nervous system depressants has additive depressant effects, and the patients should be so advised. Patients taking this drug should be warned not to exceed the dosage recommended by their physician. Toxic effects and fatalities have occurred following overdoses of phenobarbital alone and in combination with other central nervous system depressants. Caution should be exercised in prescribing unnecessarily large amounts of phenobarbital for patients who have a history of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation or who have misused alcohol and other CNS drugs (see OVERDOSAGE).
