                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The mechanism of action of VERSACLOZ is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of VERSACLOZ in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D2) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A) receptors. VERSACLOZ also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors.

                        Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H1 (Ki 1.1 nM), adrenergic α1A (Ki 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT6 (Ki 4 nM), serotonin 5-HT2A (Ki 5.4 nM), muscarinic M1 (Ki 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT7 (Ki 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT2C (Ki 9.4 nM), dopamine D4 (Ki 24 nM), adrenergic α2A (Ki 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT3  (Ki  95 nM), serotonin 5-HT1A (Ki 120 nM), dopamine D2 (Ki 160 nM), dopamine D1 (Ki 270 nM), dopamine D5 (Ki 454 nM), and dopamine D3 (Ki 555 nM). 
                        VERSACLOZ causes little or no prolactin elevation.
                        Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep.

                              Absorption
                           
                        
                        In man, clozapine tablets (25 and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. VERSACLOZ Oral Suspension is bioequivalent to clozapine marketed tablets. 
                        Following oral administration of 100 mg to 800 mg VERSACLOZ, once daily, the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 275 ng/mL (range: 105 - 723 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.2 hours (range: 1 to 3.5 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady state was 75ng/mL (range: 11 to 198 ng/mL).
                        When VERSACLOZ was administered after a high fat meal there was no effect on the AUCss or Cminss, however Cmaxwas reduced about 20%, and there was a slight delay in Tmax of 0.5 hour from a median Tmax of 2.0 hours under fasted conditions to 2.5 hours under fed conditions. The decrease in Cmax is not considered clinically relevant. Therefore VERSACLOZ may be taken without regard to meals.

                        Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important.
                        
                        
                           
                              Metabolism and Excretion
                           
                        
                        VERSACLOZ is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. VERSACLOZ is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and N-oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and N-oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range:  4-12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4-66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing.
                        A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily.

                        A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 schizophrenic patients who received clozapine under steady-state conditions. After coadministration of fluvoxamine for 14 days, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N-desmethylclozapine and clozapine N-oxide, were elevated about three-fold compared to baseline steady state concentrations. 
                        
                           Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Sertraline
                        
                        In a study of schizophrenic patients (n=14) who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, coadministration of paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline.

                        No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. Higher clozapine plasma concentrations are likely in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment when given usual doses.
                        
                           CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers
                        
                        A subset (3%–10%) of the population has reduced activity of CYP2D6 (CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses.
