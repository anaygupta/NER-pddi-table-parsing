                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Spinosad causes neuronal excitation in insects. After periods of hyperexcitation, lice become paralyzed and die.

                        The pharmacodynamics of Spinosad Topical Suspension has not been studied.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        An open-label, single-center study was conducted over a period of seven days to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of spinosad 1.8% in pediatric subjects with head lice infestation. Fourteen (14) subjects, 4 â€“ 15 years of age, with head lice were enrolled into the study. All subjects applied a single topical (scalp) treatment of spinosad 1.8% for 10 minutes, after which the test article was washed off, and subjects underwent plasma sampling. Plasma samples were analyzed by a validated LC/MS/MS method. Results demonstrated that spinosad was below the limit of quantitation (3ng/mL) in all samples. The bioavailability of benzyl alcohol from Spinosad Topical Suspension is unknown as plasma concentrations of benzyl alcohol were not determined in these subjects.
