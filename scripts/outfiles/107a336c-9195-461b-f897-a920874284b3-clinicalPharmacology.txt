                  When administered intravenously as a vehicle for
drugs, sterile water for injection provides a source of water for
parenteral fluid replenishment after sufficient solute is introduced
to achieve an osmolarity of 112 mOsmol or more per liter.
                  Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues
and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average
normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters
each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).
                  Water balance is maintained by various regulatory
mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration
of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.
