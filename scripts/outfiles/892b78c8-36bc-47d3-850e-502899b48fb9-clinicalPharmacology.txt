                  This anticholinergic preparation blocks the responses of the sphincter muscle of the iris and the ciliary muscle to cholinergic stimulation, dilating the pupil [mydriasis]. The stronger preparation (1%) also paralyzes accommodation. This preparation acts in 15-30 minutes, and the duration of activity is approximately 3-8 hours.  Complete recovery from mydriasis in some individuals may require 24 hours.  The weaker strength (0.5%) may be useful in producing mydriasis with only slight cycloplegia. Heavily pigmented irides may require more doses than lightly pigmented irides.
