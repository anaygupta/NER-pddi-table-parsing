                  Pramoxine hydrochloride is a topical anesthetic which is chemically unrelated to procaine and the other “caines”. It provides temporary relief from itching and pain by stabilizing the neuronal membranes of nerve endings with which it comes into contact.
                  Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid which has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory action of topical corticosteroids is unclear. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically- administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.
                  Chloroxylenol in low concentrations is a germicide that may be used to treat bacterial and fungal infections. It is a halogenated phenol, nontoxic, non-corrosive, non-staining with a high phenol coefficient. It may be applied directly to a wound and shows no chemical reactivity toward blood.
