Drug Interactions
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring.The following are examples of substances that may reduce the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin that may result in hyperglycemia: corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors, and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine).The following are examples of substances that may increase the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin and susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral antidiabetic products, ACE inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, MAO inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates, and sulfonamide antibiotics.Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either increase or reduce the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia.In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine, the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent. Bronchodilators and other inhaled products may alter the absorption of inhaled human insulin (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations). Consistent timing of dosing of bronchodilators relative to EXUBERA administration, close monitoring of blood glucose concentrations and dose titration as appropriate are recommended.CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations).
