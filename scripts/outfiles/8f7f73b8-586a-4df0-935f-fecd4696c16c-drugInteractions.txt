                  Isavuconazole is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4. CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may alter the plasma concentrations of isavuconazole.
                  Isavuconazole is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, and a mild inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2).
                  Drug interaction studies were conducted to investigate the effect of co-administered drugs on pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole and the effect of isavuconazole on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  



               



               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              •CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may alter the plasma concentrations of isavuconazole (7).
                           
                              •Appropriate therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment of immunosuppressants (i.e., tacrolimus, sirolimus, and cyclosporine) may be necessary when co-administered with CRESEMBA (7).
                           
                              •Drugs with a narrow therapeutic window that are P-gp substrates, such as digoxin, may require dose adjustment when administered concomitantly with CRESEMBA (7).
