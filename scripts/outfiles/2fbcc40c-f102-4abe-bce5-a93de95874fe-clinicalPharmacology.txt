                  PRE-PEN is a skin test antigen reagent that reacts specifically with benzylpenicilloyl IgE antibodies initiating the release of chemical mediators which produce an immediate wheal and flare reaction at a skin test site. All individuals exhibiting a positive skin test to PRE-PEN possess IgE against the benzylpenicilloyl structural group which is a hapten. A hapten is a low molecular weight chemical that conjugates with a carrier (e.g. poly-l-lysine) resulting in the formation of an antigen with the haptenâ€™s specificity. The benzylpenicilloyl hapten is the major antigenic determinant in penicillin-allergic individuals. However, many individuals reacting positively to PRE-PEN will not develop a systemic allergic reaction on subsequent exposure to therapeutic penicillin, especially among those who have not reacted to penicillins in the past. Thus, the PRE-PEN skin test determines the presence of penicilloyl IgE antibodies which are necessary but not sufficient for acute allergic reactions due to the major penicilloyl determinant.
                  Non-benzylpenicilloyl haptens are designated as minor determinants, since they less frequently elicit an immune response in penicillin treated individuals. The minor determinants may nevertheless be associated with significant clinical hypersensitivity. PRE-PEN does not react with IgE antibodies directed against non-benzylpenicilloyl haptens.
