                        Prolongation of prothrombin time occurs in patients stabilized on warfarin. 
                        Therapy with danazol may cause an increase in carbamazepine levels in patients taking both drugs.
                        Danazol can cause insulin resistance. Caution should be exercised when used with antidiabetic drugs. 
                        Danazol may raise the plasma levels of cyclosporin and tacrolimus, leading to an increase of the renal toxicity of these drugs. Monitoring of systemic concentrations of these drugs and appropriate dose adjustments may be needed when used concomitantly with danazol.
                        Danazol can increase the calcemic response to synthetic vitamin D analogs in primary hypoparathyroidism.
                        The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of danazol with statins such as simvastatin,Â atorvastatin and lovastatin. Caution should be exercised if used concomitantly. Consult the product labeling for statin drugs for specific information on dose restrictions in presence of danazol.
