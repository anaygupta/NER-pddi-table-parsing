CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Pharmacokinetics: Gastrointestinal absorption of nystatin is insignificant. Most orally administered nystatin is passed unchanged in the stool. In patients with renal insufficiency receiving oral therapy with conventional dosage forms, significant plasma concentrations of nystatin may occasionally occur.Pharmacokinetics: Gastrointestinal absorption of nystatin is insignificant.

Candida albicans demonstrates no significant resistance to nystatin in vitro on repeated subculture in increasing levels of nystatin; other Candida species become quite resistant. Generally, resistance does not develop in vivo. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of susceptible Candida species with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components. Nystatin exhibits no appreciable activity against bacteria, protozoa, or viruses.Microbiology:Nystatin is both fungistatic and fungicidal
