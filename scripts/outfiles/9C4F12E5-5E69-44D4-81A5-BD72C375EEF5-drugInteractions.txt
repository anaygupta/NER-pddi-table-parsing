									Acyclovir:
									
										Plasma concentrations of meperidine and its metabolite, normeperidine, may be increased by acyclovir, thus caution should be used with concomitant administration.
									
									
								
							
							
								
									
									
									Cimetidine: 
									
										Cimetidine reduced the clearance and volume of distribution of meperidine and also the formation of the metabolite, normeperidine, in healthy subjects and thus, caution should be used with concomitant administration. 
									
									
								
							
							
								
									
									
									Phenytoin: 
									
										The hepatic metabolism of meperidine may be enhanced by phenytoin. Concomitant administration resulted in reduced half-life and bioavailability in healthy subjects, however, blood concentrations of normeperidine may be increased by phenytoin, thus concomitant administration should be avoided.
									
									
								
							
							
								
									
									
									Ritonavir: 
									
										Plasma concentrations of meperidine may be increased by ritonavir, thus concomitant administration should be avoided. 
										Opioid analgesics, including meperidine, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.
