Drug Interactions
Clinically meaningful drug interactions have occurred with concomitant medications and include, but are not limited to, the following:



Agents That May Affect Carbamazepine Plasma Levels
CYP 3A4 inhibitors inhibit carbamazepine metabolism and can thus increase plasma carbamazepine levels. Drugs that have been shown, or would be expected, to increase plasma carbamazepine levels includecimetidine, danazol, diltiazem, macrolides, erythromycin, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nefazodone, loratadine, terfenadine, isoniazid, niacinamide, nicotinamide, propoxyphene, azoles (e.g., ketaconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole), acetazolamide, verapamil, grapefruit juice, protease inhibitors, valproate.**CYP 3A4 inducers can increase the rate of carbamazepine metabolism. Drugs that have been shown, or that would be expected, to decrease plasma carbamazepine levels includecisplatin, doxorubicin HCl, felbamate,† rifampin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, methsuximide, theophylline.† rifampin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, methsuximide, theophylline.When carbamazepine is given with drugs that can increase or decrease carbamazepine levels, close monitoring of carbamazepine levels is indicated and dosage adjustment may be required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *increased levels of the active 10,11-epoxide
 † decreased levels of carbamazepine and increased levels of the 10,11-epoxide
 





Effect of Carbamazepine on Plasma Levels of Concomitant Agents
Increased levels: clomipramine HCl, phenytoin, primidoneCarbamazepine induces hepatic CYP activity. Carbamazepine causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of the following:acetaminophen, alprazolam, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., felodipine), cyclosporine, corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone, dexamethasone), clonazepam, clozapine, dicumarol, doxycycline, ethosuximide, haloperidol, itraconazole, lamotrigine, levothyroxine, methadone, methsuximide, midazolam, olanzapine, oral and other hormonal contraceptives, oxcarbazepine, phensuximide, phenytoin, praziquantel, protease inhibitors, risperidone, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin, ziprasidone, zonisamide. In concomitant use with carbamazepine, dosage adjustment of the above agents may be necessary.Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects.Co-administration of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in insufficient plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite to achieve a therapeutic effect. Co-administration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).CONTRAINDICATIONS).Alterations of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications.Concomitant use of carbamazepine with hormonal contraceptive products (e.g., oral, and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be decreased. Breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancies have been reported. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered.
