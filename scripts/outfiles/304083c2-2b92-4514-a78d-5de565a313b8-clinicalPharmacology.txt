                  Ringer’s Irrigation, USP exerts a mechanical cleansing action for               sterile irrigation of body cavities, tissues or wounds, indwelling urethral catheters               and surgical drainage tubes, and for washing, rinsing or soaking surgical dressings,               instruments and laboratory specimens. It also serves as a vehicle for drugs used for               irrigation or other pharmaceutical preparations.
                  Ringer’s Irrigation, USP provides an isotonic irrigation with the               same ionic constituents as Ringer’s Injection, USP, a modification of               Ringer’s solution (also called Ringer’s mixture) originally used               only as a topical physiologic salt solution.
                  Ringer’s Irrigation, USP is considered generally compatible with               living tissues and organs.
                  Calcium Chloride in water dissociates to provide calcium (Ca++)               and chloride (Cl−) ions. They are normal constituents of the               body fluids and are dependent on various physiologic mechanisms for maintenance of               balance between intake and output. Approximately 80% of body calcium is excreted in               the feces as insoluble salts; urinary excretion accounts for the remaining               20%.
                  Potassium chloride in water dissociates to provide potassium (K+)               and chloride (Cl−) ions. Potassium is the chief cation of body               cells (160 mEq/liter of intracellular water). It is found in low concentration in               plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter in a healthy adult). Potassium               plays an important role in electrolyte balance.
                  Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine;               the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney               does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium               free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium               depletion.
                  Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and               chloride (Cl−) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal               cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and               electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl−) has an integral role in               buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood               cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride                 (Cl−) are largely under the control of the kidney which               maintains a balance between intake and output.
                  Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for               approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges               from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by               perspiration and urine production).
                  Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water               distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body               compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic               equilibrium.
