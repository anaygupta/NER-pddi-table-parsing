                        The vasodilating effects of isosorbide dinitrate may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety.
                        Concomitant use of isosorbide dinitrate with phosphodiesterase inhibitors in any form is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
                        Concomitant use of isosorbide dinitrate with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
