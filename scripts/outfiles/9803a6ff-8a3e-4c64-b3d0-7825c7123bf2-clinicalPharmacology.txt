                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Daclatasvir is a direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) against the hepatitis C virus [see Microbiology (12.4)
                           ].

                              At a dose 3 times the maximum recommended dose, daclatasvir does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetic properties of daclatasvir were evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in subjects with chronic HCV. Administration of daclatasvir tablets in HCV-infected subjects resulted in approximately dose-proportional increases in Cmax, AUC, and Cmin up to 60 mg once daily. Steady state is anticipated after approximately 4 days of once-daily daclatasvir administration. Exposure of daclatasvir was similar between healthy and HCV-infected subjects. Population pharmacokinetic estimates for daclatasvir 60 mg once daily in chronic HCV-infected subjects are shown in Table 4.
                        


                     



                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Absorption and Bioavailability
                           
                              In HCV-infected subjects following multiple oral doses of daclatasvir tablet ranging from 1 mg to 100 mg once daily, peak plasma concentrations occurred within 2 hours post dose.
                              
                                 In vitro studies with human Caco-2 cells indicated that daclatasvir is a substrate of P-gp. The absolute bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 67%.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Effect of Food on Oral Absorption
                           
                              In healthy subjects, administration of a daclatasvir 60 mg tablet after a high-fat, high-caloric meal (approximately 951 total kcal, 492 kcal from fat, 312 kcal from carbohydrates, 144 kcal from protein) decreased daclatasvir Cmax and AUC(0-inf) by 28% and 23%, respectively, compared with fasted conditions. A food effect was not observed with administration of a daclatasvir 60 mg tablet after a low-fat, low-caloric meal (approximately 277 total kcal, 41 kcal from fat, 190 kcal from carbohydrates, 44 kcal from protein) compared with fasted conditions [see Dosage and Administration (2)
                                 ].
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Distribution
                           
                              With multiple dosing, protein binding of daclatasvir in HCV-infected subjects was approximately 99% and independent of dose at the dose range studied (1-100 mg). In subjects who received daclatasvir 60 mg tablet orally followed by 100 μg [13C,15N]-daclatasvir intravenous dose, estimated volume of distribution at steady state was 47 L.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Metabolism
                           
                              Daclatasvir is a substrate of CYP3A, with CYP3A4 being the primary CYP isoform responsible for metabolism. Following single-dose oral administration of 25 mg 14C-daclatasvir in healthy subjects, the majority of radioactivity in plasma was predominately attributed to parent drug (97% or greater).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Elimination
                           
                              Following single-dose oral administration of 25 mg 14C-daclatasvir in healthy subjects, 88% of total radioactivity was recovered in feces (53% of the dose as unchanged daclatasvir) and 6.6% of the dose was excreted in the urine (primarily as unchanged daclatasvir). Following multiple-dose administration of daclatasvir in HCV-infected subjects, with doses ranging from 1 mg to 100 mg once daily, the terminal elimination half-life of daclatasvir ranged from approximately 12 to 15 hours. In subjects who received daclatasvir 60 mg tablet orally followed by 100 μg [13C,15N]-daclatasvir intravenous dose, the total clearance was 4.2 L/h.

                                    The pharmacokinetics of daclatasvir following a single 60 mg oral dose was studied in non–HCV-infected subjects with renal impairment. Using a regression analysis, the predicted AUC(0‑inf) of daclatasvir was estimated to be 26%, 60%, and 80% higher in subjects with creatinine clearance (CLcr) values of 60, 30, and 15 mL/min, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function (CLcr of 90 mL/min, defined using the Cockcroft-Gault CLcr formula), and daclatasvir unbound AUC(0-inf) was predicted to be 18%, 39%, and 51% higher for subjects with CLcr values of 60, 30, and 15 mL/min, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. Using observed data, subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis had a 27% increase in daclatasvir AUC(0-inf) and a 20% increase in unbound AUC(0-inf) compared to subjects with normal renal function as defined using the Cockcroft-Gault CLcr formula.

                                    Daclatasvir is highly protein bound to plasma proteins and is unlikely to be removed by dialysis.

                                    The pharmacokinetics of daclatasvir following a single 30 mg oral dose was studied in non–HCV-infected subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B), and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment compared to a corresponding matched control group. The Cmax and AUC(0-inf) of total daclatasvir (free and protein-bound drug) were lower by 46% and 43%, respectively, in Child-Pugh A subjects; by 45% and 38%, respectively, in Child-Pugh B subjects; and by 55% and 36%, respectively, in Child-Pugh C subjects. The Cmax and AUC(0‑inf) of unbound daclatasvir were lower by 43% and 40%, respectively, in Child-Pugh A subjects; by 14% and 2%, respectively, in Child-Pugh B subjects; and by 33% and 5%, respectively, in Child-Pugh C subjects [see

                                    Daclatasvir is a substrate of CYP3A. In vitro, daclatasvir did not inhibit (IC50 >40 µM) CYP enzymes 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, or 2D6. Daclatasvir did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate.

                                    Daclatasvir is a substrate of P-gp. However, cyclosporine, which inhibits multiple transporters including P-gp, did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of daclatasvir. Daclatasvir, in vitro, did not inhibit organic cation transporter (OCT) 2 and did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir, an organic anion transporter (OAT) substrate. Daclatasvir demonstrated inhibitory effects on digoxin (a P-gp substrate) and rosuvastatin (an OATP 1B1, OATP 1B3, and BCRP substrate) in drug-drug interaction trials.
                                    Drug interaction studies were conducted with daclatasvir and other drugs likely to be coadministered or drugs used as probes to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions. The effects of daclatasvir on the Cmax, AUC, and Cmin of the coadministered drug are summarized in Table 5, and the effects of the coadministered drug on the Cmax, AUC, and Cmin of daclatasvir are summarized in Table 6.

                           Mechanism of Action
                           
                              Daclatasvir is an inhibitor of NS5A, a nonstructural protein encoded by HCV. Daclatasvir binds to the N-terminus of NS5A and inhibits both viral RNA replication and virion assembly. Characterization of daclatasvir-resistant viruses, biochemical studies, and computer modeling data indicate that daclatasvir interacts with the N-terminus within Domain 1 of the protein, which may cause structural distortions that interfere with NS5A functions.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Antiviral Activity
                           
                              Daclatasvir had a median EC50 value of 0.2 nM (range, 0.006-3.2 nM, n=17) against hybrid replicons containing genotype 3a subject-derived NS5A sequences without detectable daclatasvir resistance-associated polymorphisms at NS5A amino acid positions 28, 30, 31, or 93. Daclatasvir activity was reduced against genotype 3a subject-derived replicons with resistance-associated polymorphisms at positions 28, 30, 31, or 93, with a median EC50 value of 13.5 nM (range, 1.3-50 nM). Similarly, the EC50 values of daclatasvir against 3 genotype 3b and 1 genotype 3i subject-derived NS5A sequences with polymorphisms (relative to a genotype 3a reference) at positions 30 or 31 were ≥3620 nM.
                              The median EC50 values of daclatasvir for genotypes 1a, 1b, 2, 4, and 5 subject-derived NS5A hybrid replicons were 0.008 nM (range, 0.002-2409 nM, n=40), 0.002 nM (range, 0.0007-10 nM, n=42), 16 nM (range, 0.005-60 nM, n=16), 0.025 nM (range, 0.001-158 nM, n=14), and 0.004 nM (range, 0.003-0.019 nM, n=3), respectively. The EC50 value against a single HCV genotype 6 derived replicon was 0.054 nM.
                              Daclatasvir was not antagonistic with interferon alfa, HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, HCV NS5B nucleoside analog inhibitors, and HCV NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitors in cell culture combination antiviral activity studies using the cell-based HCV replicon system.

                                 In Cell Culture
                                 
                                    HCV genotype 3a replicon variants with reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir were selected in cell culture, and the genotype and phenotype of daclatasvir-resistant variants were characterized. Phenotypic analysis of stable replicon cell lines showed that variant replicons containing A30K, A30T, L31F, S62L, and Y93H substitutions exhibited 56-, 1-, 603-, 1.75-, and 2737-fold reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir, respectively.

                                    Of 152 HCV genotype 3-infected subjects treated in the ALLY-3 trial, 17 experienced virologic failure, of whom 12 had cirrhosis. Post-baseline NS5A and NS5B population nucleotide sequencing data were available for virus from 17/17 and 16/17 subjects, respectively. Virus from all 17 subjects at the time of virologic failure harbored one or more of the NS5A resistance-associated substitutions A30K/S, L31I, S62A/L/P/T, or Y93H. The most common substitution at failure was Y93H (15/17 subjects), which was observed at baseline in 6 subjects and emerged in 9 subjects. For NS5B, 1 of 16 subjects had virus with the emergent NS5B resistance-associated substitution S282T at failure.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Persistence of Resistance-Associated Substitutions
                                 
                                    Limited data from ALLY-3 on the persistence of daclatasvir resistance-associated substitutions in HCV genotype 3-infected subjects are available. In a separate long-term follow-up study of predominately HCV genotype 1-infected subjects treated with daclatasvir-containing regimens in phase 2/3 clinical trials, viral populations with treatment-emergent NS5A resistance-associated substitutions persisted at detectable levels for more than 1 year in most subjects.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Effect of Baseline HCV Polymorphisms on Treatment Response
                                 
                                    In an analysis of 148 subjects with available baseline resistance data in ALLY-3, virus from 52% (77/148) of subjects had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions (defined as any change from reference at NS5A amino acid positions 28, 30, 31, 58, 62, 92, or 93) identified by population sequencing. The Y93H polymorphism was detected in 9% (13/148) of subjects receiving DAKLINZA and sofosbuvir and was associated with reduced SVR12 rates (Table 7). Polymorphisms detected at other NS5A resistance-associated positions were not associated with reduced SVR12 rates; these polymorphisms included M28V (n=1), A30K/S/T/V (n=14), P58R/S (n=3), and S62-any (n=66). Polymorphisms at positions associated with sofosbuvir resistance or exposure (defined as any change from reference at NS5B positions L159, S282, C316, L320, or V321) were not detected in the baseline NS5B sequence of any subject (n=150) in ALLY-3 by population-based sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of NS5A sequences indicated that all subjects with available data (n=148) were infected with HCV subtype 3a.
                                    


                                 



                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Cross Resistance
                                 
                                    Based on resistance patterns observed in cell culture replicon studies and HCV genotype 3-infected subjects, cross-resistance between daclatasvir and other NS5A inhibitors is expected. Cross-resistance between daclatasvir and other classes of direct-acting antivirals is not expected. The impact of prior daclatasvir treatment experience on the efficacy of other NS5A inhibitors has not been studied. Conversely, the efficacy of DAKLINZA in combination with sofosbuvir has not been studied in subjects who have previously failed treatment with regimens that include an NS5A inhibitor.
