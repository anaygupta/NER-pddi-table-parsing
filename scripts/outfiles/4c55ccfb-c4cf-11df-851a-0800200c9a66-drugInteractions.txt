                           CYP3A4 Inhibitors: The VIIBRYD dose should not exceed 20 mg once daily when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (2.4, 7).

                           CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider increasing VIIBRYD dosage by 2-fold, up to 80 mg once-daily over 1 to 2 weeks when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inducers for greater than 14 days (2.4, 7).

                     7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions With VIIBRYD

                     
                        Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment is required for drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and/or P-glycoprotein (except narrow therapeutic index drugs, e.g., digoxin), when VIIBRYD is administered concomitantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
