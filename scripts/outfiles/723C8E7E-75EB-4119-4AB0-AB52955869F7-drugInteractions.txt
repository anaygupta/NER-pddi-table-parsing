Xylocaine should be used with caution in patients with digitalis toxicity accompanied by atrioventricular block.  Concomitant use of beta-blocking agents or cimetidine may reduce hepatic blood flow and thereby reduce lidocaine clearance.Lidocaine and tocainide are pharmacodynamically similar.  The concomitant use of these two agents may cause an increased incidence of adverse reactions, including central nervous system adverse reactions such as seizure.
