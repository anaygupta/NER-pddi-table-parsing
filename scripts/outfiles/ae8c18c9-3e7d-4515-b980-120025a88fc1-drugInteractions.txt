                        Renal toxicity has been reported in a
few patients with liver dysfunction who were given oral cholecystographic
agents followed by intravascular contrast agents. Administration of
intravascular agents should therefore be postponed in any patient
with a known or suspected hepatic or biliary disorder who has recently
received a cholecystographic contrast agent.
                        Other drugs should not be admixed with iopamidol.
