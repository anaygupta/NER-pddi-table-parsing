                  Sodium Iodide I 123 is readily absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Following absorption, the iodide is distributed primarily within the extracellular fluid of the body. It is trapped and organically bound by the thyroid and concentrated by the stomach, choroid plexus and salivary glands. It is excreted by the kidneys.
                  The fraction of the administered dose which is accumulated in the thyroid gland may be a measure of thyroid function in the absence of unusually high or low iodine intake or administration of certain drugs which influence iodine accumulation by the thyroid gland. Accordingly, the patient should be questioned carefully regarding previous medication and/or procedures involving radiographic media. Normal subjects can accumulate approximately 10-50% of the administered iodine dose in the thyroid gland, however, the normal and abnormal ranges are established by individual physician's criteria. The mapping (imaging) of Sodium Iodide I 123 distribution in the thyroid gland may provide useful information concerning thyroid anatomy and definition of normal and/or abnormal functioning of tissue within the gland.
