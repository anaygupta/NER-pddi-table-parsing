                  Bortezomib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4, 2C19 and 1A2.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase VELCADE exposure. Closely monitor patients receiving VELCADE in combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. (7.1)
                           Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inducers can decrease VELCADE exposure. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers. (7.3) 
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	CYP3A4 inhibitors
                     
                        Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the exposure of bortezomib by 35% in 12 patients. Monitor patients for signs of bortezomib toxicity and consider a bortezomib dose reduction if bortezomib must be given in combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	CYP2C19 inhibitors
                     
                        Co-administration of omeprazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, had no effect on the exposure of bortezomib in 17 patients.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	CYP3A4 inducers
                     
                        Co-administration of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, is expected to decrease the exposure of bortezomib by at least 45%. Because the drug interaction study (n=6) was not designed to exert the maximum effect of rifampin on bortezomib PK, decreases greater than 45% may occur.
                        Efficacy may be reduced when VELCADE is used in combination with strong CYP3A4 inducers; therefore, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended in patients receiving VELCADE.
                        St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may decrease bortezomib exposure unpredictably and should be avoided.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4	Dexamethasone
                     
                        Co-administration of dexamethasone, a weak CYP3A4 inducer, had no effect on the exposure of bortezomib in 7 patients.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5	Melphalan-Prednisone
                     
                        Co-administration of melphalan-prednisone increased the exposure of bortezomib by 17% in 21 patients. However, this increase is unlikely to be clinically relevant.
