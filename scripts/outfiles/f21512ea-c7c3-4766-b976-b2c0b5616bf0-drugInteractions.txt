                        Lidocaine should be used with caution in patients with digitalis toxicity accompanied by atrioventricular block (see Contraindications). 
                        Coadministration of propranolol or cimetidine with lidocaine has been reported to reduce the clearance of lidocaine from the plasma and may result in toxic accumulation of the drug. 
                        When lidocaine is administered with other antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, phenytoin, procainamide, propranolol or quinidine, the cardiac effects may be additive or antagonistic and toxic effects may be additive. Phenytoin may stimulate the hepatic metabolism of lidocaine, but the clinical significance of this effect is not known.
