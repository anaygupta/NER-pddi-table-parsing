                     Introduction
                     
                        Following parenteral administration of fosphenytoin sodium injection, fosphenytoin is converted to the anticonvulsant phenytoin.  For every mmol of fosphenytoin administered, one mmol of phenytoin is produced.  The pharmacological and toxicological effects of fosphenytoin include those of phenytoin.  However, the hydrolysis of fosphenytoin to phenytoin yields two metabolites, phosphate and formaldehyde.  Formaldehyde is subsequently converted to formate, which is in turn metabolized via a folate dependent mechanism.  Although phosphate and formaldehyde (formate) have potentially important biological effects, these effects typically occur at concentrations considerably in excess of those obtained when fosphenytoin sodium injection is administered under conditions of use recommended in this labeling.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin and accordingly, its anticonvulsant effects are attributable to phenytoin.  After IV administration to mice, fosphenytoin blocked the tonic phase of maximal electroshock seizures at doses equivalent to those effective for phenytoin.  In addition to its ability to suppress maximal electroshock seizures in mice and rats, phenytoin exhibits anticonvulsant activity against kindled seizures in rats, audiogenic seizures in mice, and seizures produced by electrical stimulation of the brainstem in rats.  The cellular mechanisms of phenytoin thought to be responsible for its anticonvulsant actions include modulation of voltage-dependent sodium channels of neurons, inhibition of calcium flux across neuronal membranes, modulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels of neurons, and enhancement of the sodium-potassium ATPase activity of neurons and glial cells.  The modulation of sodium channels may be a primary anticonvulsant mechanism because this property is shared with several other anticonvulsants in addition to phenytoin.

                              Intravenous: 
                           When fosphenytoin sodium is administered by IV infusion, maximum plasma fosphenytoin concentrations are achieved at the end of the infusion.  Fosphenytoin has a half-life of approximately 15 minutes.  
                              Intramuscular
                           : Fosphenytoin is completely bioavailable following IM administration of fosphenytoin sodium.  Peak concentrations occur at approximately 30 minutes postdose.  Plasma fosphenytoin concentrations following IM administration are lower but more sustained than those following IV administration due to the time required for absorption of fosphenytoin from the injection site.
                        
                           
                              Distribution
                           : Fosphenytoin is extensively bound (95% to 99%) to human plasma proteins, primarily albumin.  Binding to plasma proteins is saturable with the result that the percent bound decreases as total fosphenytoin concentrations increase.  Fosphenytoin displaces phenytoin from protein binding sites.  The volume of distribution of fosphenytoin increases with fosphenytoin sodium dose and rate, and ranges from 4.3 to 10.8 liters.

                           The conversion half-life of fosphenytoin to phenytoin is approximately 15 minutes.  The mechanism of fosphenytoin conversion has not been determined, but phosphatases probably play a major role.  Fosphenytoin is not excreted in urine.  Each mmol of fosphenytoin is metabolized to 1 mmol of phenytoin, phosphate, and formate (see

                        In general, IM administration of fosphenytoin sodium generates systemic phenytoin concentrations that are similar enough to oral phenytoin sodium to allow essentially interchangeable use.  The pharmacokinetics of fosphenytoin following IV administration of fosphenytoin sodium, however, are complex, and when used in an emergency setting (e.g., status epilepticus), differences in rate of availability of phenytoin could be critical.  Studies have therefore empirically determined an infusion rate for fosphenytoin sodium that gives a rate and extent of phenytoin systemic availability similar to that of a 50 mg/min phenytoin sodium infusion.  A dose of 15 to 20 mg PE/kg of fosphenytoin sodium infused at 100 to 150 mg PE/min yields plasma free phenytoin concentrations over time that approximate those achieved when an equivalent dose of phenytoin sodium (e.g., parenteral phenytoin sodium) is administered at 50 mg/min (see

Mean plasma unbound phenytoin concentrations following IV administration of 1,200 mg PE fosphenytoin sodium infused at 100 mg PE/min (triangles) or 150 mg PE/min (squares) and 1,200 mg phenytoin sodium infused at 50 mg/min (diamonds) to healthy subjects (N = 12).  Inset shows time course for the entire 96-hour sampling period.
                        Following administration of single IV fosphenytoin sodium doses of 400 to 1,200 mg PE, mean maximum total phenytoin concentrations increase in proportion to dose, but do not change appreciably with changes in infusion rate.  In contrast, mean maximum unbound phenytoin concentrations increase with both dose and rate.
                        
                           
                              Absorption/Bioavailability: 
                           Fosphenytoin is completely converted to phenytoin following IV administration, with a half-life of approximately 15 minutes.  Fosphenytoin is also completely converted to phenytoin following IM administration and plasma total phenytoin concentrations peak in approximately 3 hours.
                        
                           
                              Distribution
                           : Phenytoin is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin, although to a lesser extent than fosphenytoin.  In the absence of fosphenytoin, approximately 12% of total plasma phenytoin is unbound over the clinically relevant concentration range.  However, fosphenytoin displaces phenytoin from plasma protein binding sites.  This increases the fraction of phenytoin unbound (up to 30% unbound) during the period required for conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin (approximately 0.5 to 1 hour postinfusion).
                        
                           
                              Metabolism and Elimination: 
                           Phenytoin derived from administration of fosphenytoin sodium is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine primarily as 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin and its glucuronide; little unchanged phenytoin (1% to 5% of the fosphenytoin sodium dose) is recovered in urine.  Phenytoin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.  Phenytoin hepatic metabolism is saturable, and following administration of single IV fosphenytoin sodium doses of 400 to 1,200 mg PE, total and unbound phenytoin AUC values increase disproportionately with dose.  Mean total phenytoin half-life values (12 to 28.9 hr) following fosphenytoin sodium administration at these doses are similar to those after equal doses of parenteral phenytoin sodium and tend to be greater at higher plasma phenytoin concentrations.

                           Due to an increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the interpretation of total phenytoin plasma concentrations should be made with caution (see

                           ).  Unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more useful in these patient populations.  After IV administration of fosphenytoin sodium to patients with renal and/or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, fosphenytoin clearance to phenytoin may be increased without a similar increase in phenytoin clearance.  This has the potential to increase the frequency and severity of adverse events (see

                        Infusion tolerance was evaluated in clinical studies.  One double-blind study assessed infusion-site tolerance of equivalent loading doses (15 to 20 mg PE/kg) of fosphenytoin sodium infused at 150 mg PE/min or phenytoin infused at 50 mg/min.  The study demonstrated better local tolerance (pain and burning at the infusion site), fewer disruptions of the infusion, and a shorter infusion period for fosphenytoin sodium-treated patients (Table 1).

                           ).  Infusion disruptions in fosphenytoin sodium-treated patients were primarily due to systemic burning, pruritus, and/or paresthesia while those in phenytoin-treated patients were primarily due to pain and burning at the infusion site (see Table 1).  In a double-blind study investigating temporary substitution of fosphenytoin sodium for oral phenytoin, IM fosphenytoin sodium was as well-tolerated as IM placebo.  IM fosphenytoin sodium resulted in a slight increase in transient, mild to moderate local itching (23% of patients vs 11% of IM placebo-treated patients at any time during the study).  This study also demonstrated that equimolar doses of IM fosphenytoin sodium may be substituted for oral phenytoin sodium with no dosage adjustments needed when initiating IM or returning to oral therapy.  In contrast, switching between IM and oral phenytoin requires dosage adjustments because of slow and erratic phenytoin absorption from muscle.
