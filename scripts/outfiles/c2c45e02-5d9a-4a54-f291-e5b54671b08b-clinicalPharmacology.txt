                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Voluven® contains hydroxyethyl starch in a colloidal solution which expands plasma volume when administered intravenously. This effect depends on the mean molecular weight (130,000 daltons; range 110,000 – 150,000 daltons), the molar substitution by hydroxyethyl groups (0.4; range 0.38 – 0.45) on glucose units of the starch, the pattern of hydroxyethyl substitution (C2/C6 ratio) of approximately 9:1, and the concentration (6%), as well as the dosage and infusion rate. 
                        Hydroxyethyl starch is a derivative of thin boiling waxy corn starch, which mainly consists of a glucose polymer (amylopectin) predominantly composed of α-1-4-connected glucose units with several α-1-6-branches. Substitution of hydroxyethyl groups on the glucose units of the polymer reduces the normal degradation of amylopectin by α-amylase in the body. The low molar substitution (0.4) is the main pharmacological determinant for the beneficial effects of Voluven® on pharmacokinetics, intravascular volume and hemodilution8. To describe the molecular weight and molar substitution characteristics of the hydroxyethyl starch in Voluven®, the compound is designated as hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        After isovolemic exchange of blood with 500 mL of Voluven® in healthy volunteers, blood volume is maintained for at least 6 hours. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetic profile of hydroxyethyl starch is complex and largely dependent on its molar substitution as well as its molecular weight.8  When administered intravenously, molecules smaller than the renal threshold (60,000-70,000 daltons) are readily and rapidly excreted in the urine, while molecules with higher molecular weights are metabolized by plasma α-amylase prior to excretion via the renal route. 
                        The mean 
                              in vivo
                            molecular weight of Voluven® in plasma is 70,000 – 80,000 daltons immediately following infusion and remains above the renal threshold throughout the treatment period. 
                        Following intravenous administration of 500 mL Voluven® to healthy volunteers, plasma levels of Voluven® remain at 75% of peak concentration at 30 minutes post-infusion and decrease to 14% at 6 hours post-infusion. Plasma levels of Voluven® return to baseline levels 24 hours following infusion. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution, and elimination half-life of Voluven® in healthy volunteers following IV administration of 500 mL were 31.4 mL/min, 5.9 liters, and 12 hours, respectively. Approximately 62% of Voluven® was excreted as hydroxyethyl starch molecules in urine within 72 hours.
                        The pharmacokinetics of Voluven® are similar following single and multiple dose administration. No significant plasma accumulation occurred after daily administration of 500 mL of a 10% solution containing hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 over a period of 10 days. Approximately 70% of Voluven® was excreted as hydroxyethyl starch molecules in urine within 72 hours.
                        
                           Renal Impairment: 
                        
                        Following a single intravenous administration of Voluven® (500 mL) in subjects with varying degrees of renal dysfunction, the AUC and clearance of Voluven® increased by 73% and decreased by 42% in subjects, respectively, with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min as compared to subjects with creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min. However, terminal half-life and peak hydroxyethyl starch concentration were not affected by renal impairment. Plasma levels of Voluven® returned to baseline levels 24 hours following infusion. Approximately 59 % and 51 % of Voluven® were excreted as hydroxyethyl starch molecules in urine within 72 hours in subjects with creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min and <30 mL/min, respectively9.
                        There are no data available on the use of Voluven® in subjects undergoing hemodialysis. 
                        Pharmacokinetic data in patients with hepatic insufficiency or in pediatric or geriatric patients are not available. Effects of gender or race on the pharmacokinetics of Voluven® have not been studied.
