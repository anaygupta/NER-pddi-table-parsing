                        Pharmacodynamics: 
                     Diclofenac is one of a series of phenylacetic acids that has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in pharmacological studies. It is thought to inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is essential in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins.
                  
                     
                        Animal Studies:
                      Prostaglandins have been shown in many animal models to be mediators of certain kinds of intraocular inflammation. In studies performed in animal eyes, prostaglandins have been shown to produce disruption of the blood-aqueous humor barrier, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, leukocytosis, and increased intraocular pressure.
                  
                     
                        Pharmacokinetics:
                      Results from a bioavailability study established that plasma levels of diclofenac following ocular instillation of two drops of diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution to each eye were below the limit of quantification (10 ng/mL) over a 4-hour period. This study suggests that limited, if any, systemic absorption occurs with diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution.
