efficacy of TRADJENTA may be reduced when administered in combination

                        Rifampin
decreased linagliptin exposure, suggesting that the efficacy of TRADJENTA
may be reduced when administered in combination with a strong P-gp
or CYP3A4 inducer. Therefore, use of alternative treatments is strongly
recommended when linagliptin is to be administered with a strong P-gp
or CYP3A4 inducer
