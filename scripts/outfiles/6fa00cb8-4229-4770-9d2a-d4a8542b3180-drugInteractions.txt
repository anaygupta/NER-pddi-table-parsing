                  Because of the potential for increased risk of PML and other infections, Crohn's disease patients receiving TYSABRI should not be treated with concomitant immunosuppressants (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, or methotrexate) or inhibitors of TNF-Î±, and corticosteroids should be tapered in those patients with Crohn's disease who are on chronic corticosteroids when they start TYSABRI therapy [see 
                        Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage (1.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4)].  Ordinarily, MS patients receiving chronic immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory therapy should not be treated with TYSABRI [see 
                        Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage (1.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4)].
