                     12.1	Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Alteplase is a serine protease responsible for fibrin-enhanced conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.  It produces limited conversion of plasminogen in the absence of fibrin.
                        When introduced into the systemic circulation at pharmacologic concentration, alteplase binds to fibrin in a thrombus and converts the entrapped plasminogen to plasmin.  This initiates local fibrinolysis with limited systemic proteolysis.

                        Following administration of 100 mg Activase, there is a decrease (16%-36%) in circulating fibrinogen.  In a controlled trial, 8 of 73 patients (11%) receiving Activase (1.25 mg/kg body weight over 3 hours) experienced a decrease in fibrinogen to below 100 mg/dL.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3	Pharmacokinetics 
                     
                        Alteplase in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients is rapidly cleared from the plasma with an initial half-life of less than 5 minutes.  There is no difference in the dominant initial plasma half-life between the 3-hour and accelerated regimens for AMI.  The plasma clearance of alteplase is 380-570 mL/min, primarily mediated by the liver.  The initial volume of distribution approximates plasma volume.
