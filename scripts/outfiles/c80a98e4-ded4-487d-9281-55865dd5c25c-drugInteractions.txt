                   Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; 
in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid 
antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic 
reactions. 
                  A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone 
daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone 
levels averaged 2.1 ± 1.0 μg/mL in comparison to 1.5 ± 0.5 μg/mL for Dapsone 
alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 ± 5.2 μg/mL in comparison to 
12.4 ± 4.5 μg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual 
interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of 
the other about 1.5 times. 
                  A crossover study1 designed to assess the potential of 
a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 
hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 
cells/mm3) demonstrated that there was not a significant 
drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier 
report2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients 
with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving 
Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated 
that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels 
were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. 
                  
                  
                  
                     Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis: Dapsone has 
been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing 
mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female 
rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100.
