                     12.1 Mechanism of Action

                     
                        Phenylephrine hydrochloride is an α-1 adrenergic agonist drug that is used in ophthalmology mainly for its mydriatic effect. After topical application to the conjunctiva, phenylephrine acts directly on α-adrenergic receptors in the eye, producing contraction of the dilator muscle of the pupil and constriction of the arterioles in the conjunctiva.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics

                     
                        Maximal mydriasis occurs in 20 to 90 minutes with recovery after 3 to 8 hours.

                        Systemic absorption of sufficient quantities of phenylephrine may lead to systemic α-adrenergic effects, such as rise in blood pressure which may be accompanied by a reflex atropine-sensitive bradycardia.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics

                     
                        The systemic exposure following topical administration of phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution has not been studied. A higher systemic absorption is expected for the 10% solution than the 2.5% solution and when the corneal barrier function is compromised.
