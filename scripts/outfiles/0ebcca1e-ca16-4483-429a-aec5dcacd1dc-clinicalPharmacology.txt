                        Atenolol and chlorthalidone have been used singly and concomitantly for the treatment of hypertension.  The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive, and studies have shown that there is no interference with bioavailability when these agents are given together in the single combination tablet.  Therefore, this combination provides a convenient formulation for the concomitant administration of these two entities.  In patients with more severe hypertension, TENORETIC may be administered with other antihypertensives such as vasodilators.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Atenolol
                     
                        Atenolol is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent without membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic (partial agonist) activities.  This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher doses, atenolol inhibits beta2-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.
