                  A gradual depletion of red blood cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) occurs with storage of RBC at 1-6 °C.1 The level of 2,3-DPG in RBC stored for greater than 14 days is less than 10% of normal1,2,12,17,18. Rejuvenation of RBC with rejuvesol®
                      Solution increases the levels of ATP and 2,3-DPG.1-5,8,13,17-22,24, 25
                  
                  An in vitro loss of red blood cells occurs with the preservation and processing of RBC. Thus, the effectiveness of a transfusion is influenced by both the total number of red blood cells transfused and the number of those cells which remain in circulation. Therefore, the "dose" of a transfusion is defined as the percentage of pre-transfusion recovered red blood cells multiplied by the 24 hour post-transfusion survival value.
                  Rejuvenation is accomplished by incubating the contents of one 50 mL vial of rejuvesol®
                      Solution with one unit of RBC (prepared from up to 550 mL of whole blood) for sixty (60) minutes at 37 °C. Citra recommends that the entire 50 mL of rejuvesol®
                      Solution be added to a "smaller than normal" RBC as long as the prerejuvenation net packed cell weight is greater than 110 grams.1,9
