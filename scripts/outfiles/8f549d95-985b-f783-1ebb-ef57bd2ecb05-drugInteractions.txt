                  Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human CYP3A4 isoenzyme system; therefore potential interactions may occur when FENTORA is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. 
                  The concomitant use of FENTORA with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving FENTORA who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done cautiously [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The concomitant use of FENTORA with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of FENTORA. Patients receiving FENTORA who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers should be monitored for signs of increased FENTORA activity and the dose of FENTORA should be adjusted accordingly.
