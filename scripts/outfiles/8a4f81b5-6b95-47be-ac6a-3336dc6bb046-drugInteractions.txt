                  Salicylates compete with the binding of several drugs and can modify the action of these drugs.  Due to the competition of salicylate with other drugs for binding to serum albumin, the following drug interactions may occur:
                  Tolbutamide, Sulfonylureas—Can potentiate hypoglycemia.
 Methotrexate—Decreases tubular reabsorption.
 Oral Anticoagulants—Increases bleeding. 
 Corticosteroids—Decreases plasma salicylate level; tapering doses of steroids may promote salicylism. 
 Ammonium Sulfate—Increases plasma salicylate level. 
 Heparin Salicylate—Decreases platelet adhesiveness and interferes with hemostasis in heparin-treated patients. 
Pyrazinamide—Inhibits pyrazinamide-induced hyperuricemia. 
 Uricosuric Agents—Effect of probenecid, sulfinpyrazone and phenylbutazone inhibited.
