                  Chlorpheniramine
maleate competitively antagonizes most of the
smooth muscle stimulating actions of histamine on the
H1
receptors of the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial
muscle. It also antagonizes the action of histamine
that
results in increased capillary permeability and the formation
of edema. Chlorpheniramine maleate is analkylamine-type
antihistamine. 
This group of antihistamines are
among the most active histamine antagonists and are
generally
effective in relatively low doses. They thereby prevent,
but do not reverse, responses mediated by histamine
alone.
The anticholinergic actions of most antihistamines provide
a drying effect on the nasal mucosa. These drugs are
not
so prone to produce drowsiness and are among the most suitable
agents for daytime use, but a significant proportion
of
patients do experience this effect.
                  Scopolamine
methyl nitrate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic
components of belladonna
alkaloids
that exhibits antisecretory activity. Scopolamine methyl
nitrate inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine
on
structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves:
smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, sinoatrial and
atrioventricular
nodes, and exocrine glands. In general, the smaller
doses of anticholinergics inhibit salivary and
bronchial
secretions, sweating, and accommodation; cause dilation
of the pupil; and may affect the heart rate.
