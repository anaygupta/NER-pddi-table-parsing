                  Phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride is a long-acting, adrenergic, alpha-receptor-blocking agent, which can produce and maintain "chemical sympathectomy" by oral administration. It increases blood flow to the skin, mucosa and abdominal viscera, and lowers both supine and erect blood pressures. It has no effect on the parasympathetic system. 
                  Twenty to 30 percent of orally administered phenoxybenzamine appears to be absorbed in the active form.ยน
                  The half-life of orally administered phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride is not known; however, the half-life of intravenously administered drug is approximately 24 hours. Demonstrable effects with intravenous administration persist for at least 3 to 4 days, and the effects of daily administration are cumulative for nearly a week.ยน
