                           Vasoconstrictors
                           
                              Dihydroergotamine mesylate, USP nasal spray should not be used with peripheral vasoconstrictors because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Sumatriptan
                           
                              Sumatriptan has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effect could be additive with dihydroergotamine mesylate, USP nasal spray. Sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine mesylate, USP nasal spray should not be taken within 24 hours of each other.

                              Although the results of a clinical study did not indicate a safety problem associated with the administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate, USP nasal spray to subjects already receiving propranolol, there have been reports that propranolol may potentiate the vasoconstrictive action of ergotamine by blocking the vasodilating property of epinephrine.

                              Nicotine may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients, predisposing to a greater ischemic response to ergot therapy.

                           SSRI's
                           
                              Weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination have been reported rarely when 5HT1 agonists have been coadministered with SSRI's (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline). There have been no reported cases from spontaneous reports of drug interaction between SSRI's and dihydroergotamine mesylate, USP nasal spray or D.H.E. 45Â®.

                              The effect of oral contraceptives on the pharmacokinetics of dihydroergotamine mesylate, USP nasal spray has not been studied.
