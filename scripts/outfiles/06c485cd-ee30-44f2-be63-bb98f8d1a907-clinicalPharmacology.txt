A number of diabetes-like signs and symptoms are seen in chromium deficiency including impaired glucose tolerance, fasting hyperglycemia, glucosuria, elevated circulating insulin and peripheral neuropathy. Dietary chromium intake less than 25% has been reported to adversely affect insulin sensitivity in subjects with mildly impaired glucose tolerance (Anderson, 2000). Over time, urinary chromium losses may contribute to insulin resistance and exacerbate compromised insulin sensitivity in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). (Anderson et al., 1991 ; Cefalu and Hu, 2004)
