                     12.1	Mechanism of action
                     
                        UCDs are inherited deficiencies of enzymes or transporters necessary for the synthesis of urea from ammonia (NH3, NH4
                           +). Absence of these enzymes or transporters results in the accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the blood and brain of affected patients. RAVICTI is a triglyceride containing 3 molecules of phenylbutyrate (PBA). PAA, the major metabolite of PBA, is the active moiety of RAVICTI. PAA conjugates with glutamine (which contains 2 molecules of nitrogen) via acetylation in the liver and kidneys to form PAGN, which is excreted by the kidneys (Figure 1). On a molar basis, PAGN, like urea, contains 2 moles of nitrogen and provides an alternate vehicle for waste nitrogen excretion.

                           Pharmacological Effects
                        
                        In clinical studies, total 24-hour AUC of ammonia concentration was comparable at steady state during the switchover period between RAVICTI and sodium phenylbutyrate [see Clinical Studies (14)
                           ].  
                        
                           Cardiac Electrophysiology
                        
                        The effect of multiple doses of RAVICTI 13.2 g/day and 19.8 g/day (approximately 69% and 104% of the maximum recommended daily dosage) on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg), four-treatment-arm, crossover study in 57 healthy subjects. The upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc, based on individual correction method (QTcI) for RAVICTI, was below 10 ms. However, assay sensitivity was not established in this study because the moxifloxacin time-profile was not consistent with expectation. Therefore, an increase in mean QTc interval of 10 ms cannot be ruled out.

                           Absorption
                        
                        RAVICTI is a pro-drug of PBA. Upon oral ingestion, PBA is released from the glycerol backbone in the gastrointestinal tract by lipases. PBA derived from RAVICTI is further converted by β-oxidation to PAA.  
                        In healthy, fasting adult subjects receiving a single oral dose of 2.9 mL/m2 of RAVICTI, peak plasma levels of PBA, PAA, and PAGN occurred at 2 h, 4 h, and 4 h, respectively. Upon single-dose administration of RAVICTI, plasma concentrations of PBA were quantifiable in 15 of 22 participants at the first sample time postdose (0.25 h). Mean maximum concentration (Cmax) for PBA, PAA, and PAGN was 37.0 µg/mL, 14.9 µg/mL, and 30.2 µg/mL, respectively. In healthy subjects, intact glycerol phenylbutyrate was detected in plasma. While the study was inconclusive, the incomplete hydrolysis of glycerol phenylbutyrate cannot be ruled out. 
                        In healthy subjects, the systemic exposure to PAA, PBA, and PAGN increased in a dose-dependent manner. Following 4 mL of RAVICTI for 3 days (3 times a day [TID]), mean Cmax and AUC were 66 µg/mL and 930 µg•h/mL for PBA and 28 µg/mL and 942 µg•h/mL for PAA, respectively. In the same study, following 6 mL of RAVICTI for 3 days (TID), mean Cmax and AUC were 100µg/mL and 1400 µg•h/mL for PBA and 65 µg/mL and 2064 µg•h/mL for PAA, respectively.
                        In adult UCD patients receiving multiple doses of RAVICTI, maximum plasma concentrations at steady state (Cmaxss) of PBA, PAA, and PAGN occurred at 8 h, 12 h, and 10 h, respectively, after the first dose in the day. Intact glycerol phenylbutyrate was not detectable in plasma in UCD patients.
                        
                           Distribution
                        
                        
                           In vitro, the extent of plasma protein binding for 14C-labeled metabolites was 80.6% to 98.0% for PBA (over 1-250 µg/mL), and 37.1% to 65.6% for PAA (over 5-500 µg/mL). The protein binding for PAGN was 7% to 12% and no concentration effects were noted.  
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        Upon oral administration, pancreatic lipases hydrolyze RAVICTI (i.e., glycerol phenylbutyrate), and release PBA. PBA undergoes β-oxidation to PAA, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and in the kidney through the enzyme phenylacetyl-CoA: L-glutamine-N-acetyltransferase to form PAGN. PAGN is subsequently eliminated in the urine. 
                        Saturation of conjugation of PAA and glutamine to form PAGN was suggested by increases in the ratio of plasma PAA to PAGN with increasing dose and with increasing severity of hepatic impairment. 
                        In healthy subjects, after administration of 4 mL, 6 mL, and 9 mL 3 times daily for 3 days, the ratio of mean AUC0-23h of PAA to PAGN was 1, 1.25, and 1.6, respectively. In a separate study, in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C), the ratios of mean Cmax  values for PAA to PAGN among all patients dosed with 6 mL and 9 mL twice daily were 3 and 3.7.
                        In in vitro studies, the specific activity of lipases for glycerol phenylbutyrate was in the following decreasing order: pancreatic triglyceride lipase, carboxyl ester lipase, and pancreatic lipase–related protein 2. Further, glycerol phenylbutyrate was hydrolyzed in vitro by esterases in human plasma. In these in vitro studies, a complete disappearance of glycerol phenylbutyrate did not produce molar equivalent PBA, suggesting the formation of mono- or bis-ester metabolites. However, the formation of mono- or bis-esters was not studied in humans. 
                        
                           Excretion
                        
                        The mean (SD) percentage of administered PBA excreted as PAGN was approximately 68.9% (17.2) in adults and 66.4% (23.9) in pediatric UCD patients at steady state. PAA and PBA represented minor urinary metabolites, each accounting for <1% of the administered dose of PBA.

                        In healthy adult volunteers, a gender effect was found for all metabolites, with women generally having higher plasma concentrations of all metabolites than men at a given dose level. In healthy female volunteers, mean Cmax for PAA was 51 and 120% higher than in male volunteers after administration of 4 mL and 6 mL 3 times daily for 3 days, respectively. The dose normalized mean AUC0-23h for PAA was 108% higher in females than in males.

                        Population pharmacokinetic modeling and dosing simulations suggest body surface area to be the most significant covariate explaining the variability of PAA clearance. PAA clearance was 10.9 L/h, 16.4 L/h, and 24.4 L/h, respectively, for UCD patients ages 3 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 17 years
                        
                           
                              Hepatic Impairment
                           
                        
                        The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of RAVICTI were studied in patients with hepatic impairment of Child-Pugh A, B, and C receiving 100 mg/kg of RAVICTI twice daily for 7 days. 
                        Plasma glycerol phenylbutyrate was not measured in patients with hepatic impairment.
                        After multiple doses of RAVICTI in patients with hepatic impairment of Child-Pugh A, B, and C, geometric mean AUCt of PBA was 42%, 84%, and 50% higher, respectively, while geometric mean AUCt of PAA was 22%, 53%, and 94% higher, respectively, than in healthy subjects.
                        In patients with hepatic impairment of Child-Pugh A, B, and C, geometric mean AUCt of PAGN was 42%, 27%, and 22% lower, respectively, than that in healthy subjects. 
                        The proportion of PBA excreted as PAGN in the urine in Child-Pugh A, B, and C was 80%, 58%, and 85%, respectively, and, in healthy volunteers, was 67%.
                        In another study in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C), mean Cmax of PAA was 144 µg/mL (range: 14-358 µg/mL) after daily dosing of 6 mL of RAVICTI twice daily, while mean Cmax of PAA was 292 µg/mL (range: 57-655 µg/mL) after daily dosing of 9 mL of RAVICTI twice daily. The ratio of mean Cmax  values for PAA to PAGN among all patients dosed with 6 mL and 9 mL twice daily were 3 and 3.7, respectively.
                        After multiple doses, a PAA concentration >200 µg/L was associated with a ratio of plasma PAA to PAGN concentrations higher than 2.5.  
                        
                           Renal Impairment
                        
                        The pharmacokinetics of RAVICTI in patients with impaired renal function, including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or those on hemodialysis, have not been studied.
                        
                           Drug Interaction Studies
                        
                        
                           In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that the principle metabolite, phenylbutyrate, at a concentration of 800 µg/mL caused >60% reversible inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 (testosterone 6β-hydroxylase activity). Subsequent in vitro studies suggest that in vivo drug interactions with substrates of CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 are possible. No in vivo drug interaction studies were conducted. The inhibition of CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2C8, 2C19, and 2D6 by PAA at the concentration of 2.8 mg/mL was observed in vitro. Clinical implication of these results is unknown. 
                        
                           In vitro PBA or PAA did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, suggesting that in vivo drug interactions via induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are unlikely.
