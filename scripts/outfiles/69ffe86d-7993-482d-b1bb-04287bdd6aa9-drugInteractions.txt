                    Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Reduced diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics. (7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Drug Interactions with Metoprolol
                     
                        
                           Reserpine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors: The concomitant use of catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) with beta adrenergic blockers may have an additive affect and increase the risk of hypotension or bradycardia.  Observe patients treated with DUTOPROL plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
                        
                        
                           CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone are likely to increase metoprolol concentration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  
                        
                           Nondihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
                        
                        
                           Digoxin: Digitalis glycosides slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate.  Concomitant use of digoxin with beta adrenergic blockers increases the risk of bradycardia.  
                        
                           Clonidine: Clonidine slows conduction and decrease heart rate.  Concomitant use with beta adrenergic blockers increases the risk of bradycardia.  If clonidine and DUTOPROL are to both be discontinued, withdraw DUTOPROL several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine to reduce the risk of rebound hypertension following the clonidine withdrawal.  If a patient is to switch from clonidine to DUTOPROL, delay the introduction of DUTOPROL for several days after discontinuation of clonidine.  
                        
                           Epinephrine: [See Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Drug Interactions with Hydrochlorothiazide
                     
                        
                           Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin): Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. 
                        
                           Ion exchange resins: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively.  Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins (e.g., cholestyramine and colestipol resins) such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins to minimize the interaction. 
                        
                           Lithium: Diuretics reduce the renal clearance of lithium and increase the risk of lithium toxicity.  Monitor serum lithium concentrations during concurrent use. 
                        
                           Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: NSAIDs can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics.
