                  Mechanism of ActionFollowing topical administration, beclomethasone dipropionate 
produces anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictor effects. The mechanisms 
responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of beclomethasone dipropionate are 
unknown. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on 
multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, 
and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and 
cytokines) involved in inflammation. The direct relationship of these findings 
to the effects of beclomethasone dipropionate on allergic rhinitis symptoms is 
not known. 
                  Biopsies of nasal mucosa obtained during clinical studies showed no 
histopathologic changes when beclomethasone dipropionate was administered 
intranasally.
                  Beclomethasone dipropionate is a pro-drug with weak glucocorticoid receptor 
binding affinity. It is hydrolyzed via esterase enzymes to its active metabolite 
beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (B-17-MP), which has high topical 
anti-inflammatory activity.
                  
                  
                  Pharmacokinetics
                  
                  AbsorptionBeclomethasone dipropionate is sparingly soluble in water. When 
given by nasal inhalation in the form of an aqueous or aerosolized suspension, 
the drug is deposited primarily in the nasal passages. The majority of the drug 
is eventually swallowed. Following intranasal administration of aqueous 
beclomethasone dipropionate, the systemic absorption was assessed by measuring 
the plasma concentrations of its active metabolite B-17-MP, for which the 
absolute bioavailability following intranasal administration is 44% (43% of the 
administered dose came from the swallowed portion and only 1% of the total dose 
was bioavailable from the nose). The absorption of unchanged beclomethasone 
dipropionate following oral and intranasal dosing was undetectable (plasma 
concentrations less than 50 pg/mL).
                  
                  
                  DistributionThe tissue distribution at steady state for beclomethasone 
dipropionate is moderate (20 L) but more extensive for B-17-MP (424 L). There is 
no evidence of tissue storage of beclomethasone dipropionate or its metabolites. 
Plasma protein binding is moderately high (87%).
                  
                  
                  MetabolismBeclomethasone dipropionate is cleared very rapidly from the 
systemic circulation by metabolism mediated via esterase enzymes that are found 
in most tissues. The main product of metabolism is the active metabolite 
(B-17-MP). Minor inactive metabolites, beclomethasone-21-monopropionate 
(B-21-MP) and beclomethasone (BOH), are also formed, but these contribute little 
to systemic exposure.
                  
                  
                  EliminationThe elimination of beclomethasone dipropionate and B-17-MP after 
intravenous administration are characterized by high plasma clearance (150 and 
120 L/hour) with corresponding terminal elimination half-lives of 0.5 and 
2.7 hours. Following oral administration of tritiated beclomethasone 
dipropionate, approximately 60% of the dose was excreted in the feces within 
96 hours, mainly as free and conjugated polar metabolites. Approximately 12% of 
the dose was excreted as free and conjugated polar metabolites in the urine. The 
renal clearance of beclomethasone dipropionate and its metabolites is 
negligible.
                  
                  
                  PharmacodynamicsThe effects of beclomethasone dipropionate on 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function have been evaluated in adult 
volunteers by other routes of administration. Studies with beclomethasone 
dipropionate by the intranasal route may demonstrate that there is more or that 
there is less absorption by this route of administration. There was no 
suppression of early morning plasma cortisol concentrations when beclomethasone 
dipropionate was administered in a dose of 1,000 mcg/day for 1 month as an oral 
aerosol or for 3 days by intramuscular injection. However, partial suppression 
of plasma cortisol concentrations was observed when beclomethasone dipropionate 
was administered in doses of 2,000 mcg/day either by oral aerosol or 
intramuscular injection. Immediate suppression of plasma cortisol concentrations 
was observed after single doses of 4,000 mcg of beclomethasone dipropionate. 
Suppression of HPA function (reduction of early morning plasma cortisol levels) 
has been reported in adult patients who received 1,600-mcg daily doses of oral 
beclomethasone dipropionate for 1 month. In clinical studies using 
beclomethasone dipropionate aerosol intranasally, there was no evidence of 
adrenal insufficiency. The effect of BECONASE AQ Nasal Spray on HPA function was 
not evaluated but would not be expected to differ from intranasal beclomethasone 
dipropionate aerosol.
                  In 1 study in children with asthma, the administration of inhaled 
beclomethasone at recommended daily doses for at least 1 year was associated 
with a reduction in nocturnal cortisol secretion. The clinical significance of 
this finding is not clear. It reinforces other evidence, however, that topical 
beclomethasone may be absorbed in amounts that can have systemic effects and 
that physicians should be alert for evidence of systemic effects, especially in 
chronically treated patients (see PRECAUTIONS).
