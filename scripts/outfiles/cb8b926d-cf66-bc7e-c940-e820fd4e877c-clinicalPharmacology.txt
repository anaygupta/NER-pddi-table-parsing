                        Ropivacaine is a member of the amino amide class of local
                                    anesthetics and is supplied as the pure
                                    S-(-)-enantiomer.  Local anesthetics block the
                                    generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by
                                    increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve,
                                    by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing
                                    the rate of rise of the action potential.  In general,
                                    the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter,
                                    myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve
                                    fibers.  Clinically, the order of loss of nerve
                                    function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch,
                                    (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone.
