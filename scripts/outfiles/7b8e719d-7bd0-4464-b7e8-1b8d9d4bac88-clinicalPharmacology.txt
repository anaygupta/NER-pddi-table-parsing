                  Sulfacetamide sodium exerts a bacteriostatic effect against sulfonamide sensitive Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms commonly isolated from secondary cutaneous pyogenic infections. It acts by restricting the synthesis of folic acid required by bacteria for growth, by its competition with para-aminobenzoic acid. There are no clinical data available on the degree and rate of systemic absorption of SEB-Prevâ„¢ Wash when applied to the skin or scalp. However, significant absorption
                  of sulfacetamide sodium through the skin has been reported.
                  The following in vitro data are available but their clinical significance is unknown. Organisms which show susceptibility to sulfacetamide sodium are: Streptococci, Staphylococci, E. coli, 
                     Klebsiella
                     
                     pneumoniae
