                        Metronidazole is an antimicrobial drug [see Clinical 
                           Pharmacology, Microbiology (12.4)​].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Following a single, intravaginal 5 g dose of NUVESSA (equivalent to 65 mg of metronidazole) to 20 healthy female subjects, a mean maximum serum metronidazole concentration (Cmax) of 239 ng/mL was observed (range: 114 to 428 ng/mL). The average time to achieve this Cmax was 7.3 hours (range: 4 to 18 hours). This Cmax is approximately 2% of the mean maximum serum concentration reported in healthy subjects administered a single, oral 500 mg dose of metronidazole tablets (mean Cmax = 12,785 ng/mL).
                        The extent of exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] of metronidazole, when administered as a single intravaginal 5 g dose of NUVESSA (equivalent to 65 mg of metronidazole), was 5,434 ng•hr/mL (range: 1382 to 12744 ng•hr/mL). This AUC0-∞ is approximately 4% of the reported AUC of metronidazole following a single oral 500 mg dose of metronidazole (approximately 125,000 ng•hr/mL).

                        Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent that acts primarily against anaerobic bacteria and selected protozoa. The 5-nitro group on the metronidazole molecule is reduced by metabolically active anaerobes to its active state by the bacterial nitro-reductase enzyme after it diffuses into the bacterial cell. This results in the production of cytotoxic compounds that disrupt the helical structure of bacterial DNA thereby inhibiting bacterial nucleic acid synthesis which leads to cell death.
                        Culture and sensitivity testing of bacteria are not routinely performed to establish the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. [see Clinical Studies (14)]
                        Metronidazole is active in vitro against most isolates of the following organisms that have been reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis:
                        
                           Bacteroides spp.

                           
                           Gardnerella vaginalis
Mobiluncus spp.
Peptostreptococcus spp.
