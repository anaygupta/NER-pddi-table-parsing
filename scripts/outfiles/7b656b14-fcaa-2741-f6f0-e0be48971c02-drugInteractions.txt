                        Anticholinergics: May interact
additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid
administration of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT with other anticholinergic-containing
drugs. (7.2)

Methylxanthines, Steroids
                     
                        SPIRIVA RESPIMAT has been used concomitantly
with short-acting and long-acting sympathomimetic (beta-agonists)
bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids, without
increases in adverse reactions.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Anticholinergics
                     
                        There is potential for an additive
interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. 
Therefore, avoid coadministration of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT with other anticholinergic-containing
drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6)].
