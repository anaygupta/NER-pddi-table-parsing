Drug Interactions 
The co-administration of salicylates and low molecular weight heparins or heparinoids may result in an increased risk of bleeding (i.e., hematomas) following neuraxial anesthesia.  Salicylates should be discontinued prior to the initiation of a low molecular weight heparin or heparinoid.  If this is not possible, it is recommended to monitor patients closely for bleeding.Increased prothrombin time in patients taking concomitant warfarin has been reported.The co-administration of olsalazine and 6-mercaptopurine or thioguanine may result in an increased risk of myelosuppression.  If co-administered with 6-mercaptopurine, it is recommended to use the lowest possible doses of each drug and to monitor the patient, especially for leukopenia. In case of co-administration with thioguanine, careful monitoring of blood counts is recommended.It is recommended not to give salicylates for six weeks after the varicella vaccine to avoid a possible increased risk of developing Reyeâ€™s syndrome.
