                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II).  Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium.  Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland.  Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.
                        There is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis.  Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.
                        Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension.  ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE.  Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin.  Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known.  Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.
                        Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Candesartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusion in a dose-dependent manner.  After 1 week of once daily dosing with 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil, the pressor effect was inhibited by approximately 90% at peak with approximately 50% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. 
                        Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA), increased in a dose-dependent manner after single and repeated administration of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects, hypertensive, and heart failure patients.  ACE activity was not altered in healthy subjects after repeated candesartan cilexetil administration.  The once-daily administration of up to 16 mg of candesartan cilexetil to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations, but a decrease in the plasma concentration of aldosterone was observed when 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil was administered to hypertensive patients.  In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed.
                        
                           Hypertension
                        
                        Adults
                        In multiple-dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in metabolic function, including serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, or uric acid.  In a 12-week study of 161 patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, there was no change in the level of HbA1c.
                        
                           Heart Failure
                        
                        In heart failure patients, candesartan ≥ 8 mg resulted in decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        
                           Distribution
                        
                        The volume of distribution of candesartan is 0.13 L/kg. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells.  The protein binding is constant at candesartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses.  In rats, it has been demonstrated that candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all.  It has also been demonstrated in rats that candesartan passes across the placental barrier and is distributed in the fetus.
                        
                           Metabolism and Excretion
                        
                        Total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/min/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/min/kg.  When candesartan is administered orally, about 26% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine.  Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled candesartan cilexetil, approximately 33% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 67% in feces.  Following an intravenous dose of 14C-labeled candesartan, approximately 59% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and approximately 36% in feces.  Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of candesartan.
                        
                           Adults
                        
                        Candesartan cilexetil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by O-deethylation to an inactive metabolite. The elimination half-life of candesartan is approximately 9 hours. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing.
                        Following administration of candesartan cilexetil, the absolute bioavailability of candesartan was estimated to be 15%.  After tablet ingestion, the peak serum concentration (Cmax) is reached after 3 to 4 hours.  Food with a high fat content does not affect the bioavailability of candesartan after candesartan cilexetil administration.
                        
                           Pediatrics
                        
                        In children 1 to 17 years of age, plasma levels are greater than 10-fold higher at peak (approximately 4 hours) than 24 hours after a single dose.
                        Children 1 to <6 years of age, given 0.2 mg/kg had exposure similar to adults given 8 mg.
                        Children >6 years of age had exposure similar to adults given the same dose. 
                        The pharmacokinetics (Cmax and AUC) were not modified by age, sex or body weight.
                        Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age.
                        From the dose-ranging studies of candesartan cilexetil, there was a dose related increase in plasma candesartan concentrations.
                        The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in kidney development.  RAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice.  Children <1 year of age must not receive candesartan cilexetil.  Administering drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can alter normal renal development.
                        
                           Geriatric and Sex
                        
                        The pharmacokinetics of candesartan have been studied in the elderly (≥65 years) and in both sexes. The plasma concentration of candesartan was higher in the elderly (Cmax was approximately 50% higher, and AUC was approximately 80% higher) compared to younger subjects administered the same dose. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in the elderly, and candesartan and its inactive metabolite did not accumulate in the serum of these subjects upon repeated, once-daily administration. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan between male and female subjects.
                        
                           Renal Insufficiency
                        
                        In hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of candesartan were elevated. After repeated dosing, the AUC and Cmax were approximately doubled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73m2) compared to patients with normal kidney function. The pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive patients undergoing hemodialysis are similar to those in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment. Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1)].
                        In heart failure patients with renal impairment, AUC0-72h was 36% and 65% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively. Cmax was 15% and 55% higher in mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively.
                        
                           Pediatrics
                        
                        Candesartan cilexetil pharmacokinetics have not been determined in children with renal insufficiency.
                        
                           Hepatic Insufficiency
                        
                        The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were compared in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil.  The increase in AUC for candesartan was 30% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and 145% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B).  The increase in Cmax for candesartan was 56% in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 73% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  The pharmacokinetics after candesartan cilexetil administration have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment.  In hypertensive patients with moderate hepatic impairment, consideration should be given to initiation of candesartan cilexetil at a lower dose [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1)].
                        
                           Heart Failure
                        
                        The pharmacokinetics of candesartan were linear in patients with heart failure (NYHA class II and III) after candesartan cilexetil doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg.  After repeated dosing, the AUC was approximately doubled in these patients compared with healthy, younger patients.  The pharmacokinetics in heart failure patients is similar to that in healthy elderly volunteers [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)].
