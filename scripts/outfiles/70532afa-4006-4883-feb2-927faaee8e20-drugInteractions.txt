                  Concomitant oral administration of ketoconazole (a known inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity in the liver and in the intestinal mucosa) caused an eight-fold increase of the systemic exposure to oral budesonide.  If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the budesonide dose should be considered. After extensive intake of grapefruit juice (which inhibits CYP3A4 activity predominantly in the intestinal mucosa), the systemic exposure for oral budesonide increased about two times.  Ingestion of grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be avoided in connection with budesonide administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              â€¢Cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, grapefruit juice) should be avoided. May cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. (2.3, 7, 12.3)
