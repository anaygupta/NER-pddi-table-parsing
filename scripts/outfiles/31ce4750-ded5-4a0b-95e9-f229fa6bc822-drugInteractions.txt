                        No drug-drug interactions are expected with CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors.   Clinically meaningful differences in exposure (AUC) were not observed in patients with advanced solid tumors when HALAVEN was administered with or without ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a P-gp inhibitor) and when HALAVEN was administered with or without rifampin (a CYP3A4 inducer) [see Clinical Pharmacology (

                        Eribulin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 enzymes or induce CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 enzymes at relevant clinical concentrations.  Eribulin is not expected to alter the plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of these enzymes [see Clinical Pharmacology (
