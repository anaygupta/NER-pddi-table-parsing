                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        In a bioavailability study, 12 subjects with moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis applied 3 g of ketoconazole foam, 2% twice daily for 4 weeks. Circulating plasma levels of ketoconazole were < 6 ng/mL for a majority of subjects (75%), with a maximum level of 11 ng/mL observed in one subject.

                        Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro synthesis of ergosterol, a key sterol in the cell membrane of Malassezia furfur. The clinical significance of antifungal activity in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis is not known.
