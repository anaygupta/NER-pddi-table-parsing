                  Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution possesses
predominantly (α-adrenergic effects.  In
the eye, phenylephrine acts locally as a potent vasoconstrictor and mydriatic,
by constricting ophthalmic blood vessels and radial muscle of the iris.
                  The ophthalmologic usefulness of phenylephrine hydrochloride
is due to its rapid effect and moderately prolonged action, as well as to the
fact that it produces no compensatory vasodilatation.

The action of different concentrations of ophthalmic
solutions of phenylephrine hydrochloride is shown in the following table:

                  

                  
                  
Although rare, systemic absorption of sufficient
quantities of phenylephrine may lead to system (α-adrenergic effects, such as
rise in blood pressure which may be accompanied by a reflex atropine-sensitive
bradycardia.
