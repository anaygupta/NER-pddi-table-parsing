                  In vitro, citrate ions combine with ionic calcium in the blood and the resulting
                  lack of ionic calcium prevents coagulation. Blood that has been treated with citrate anticoagulants is nontoxic to the body when injected in small amounts intravenously. After injection, citrate ions are rapidly removed from the blood by the liver, polymerized into glucose, and then metabolized in the usual manner
