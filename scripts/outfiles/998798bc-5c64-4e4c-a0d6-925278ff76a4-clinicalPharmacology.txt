                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The systemic absorption of Ecoza topical foam, 1% following topical application was studied in one clinical trial in adults and one clinical study in pediatric subjects.
                        In the adult trial, 19 subjects (male and female) with tinea pedis applied Ecoza topical foam, 1% once daily for 29 days.  Subjects applied a mean daily amount of 2.4 g of Ecoza topical foam, 1% to soles, toes, interdigital spaces and tops of both feet up to the ankles. Blood samples were obtained on Day 29 at pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after application.  Results (mean ± SD) showed the time to reach peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) was 6.8 ± 5.1 h with maximum concentration (Cmax) of 417 ± 218 pg/ml. The area under the concentration time curve for the first 12 hours post application on Day 29 (AUC(0-12)) was 3440 ± 1920 pg-h/ml.  
                        In the pediatric trial, 18 subjects (male and female ages 12 to 17) with interdigital tinea pedis and positive fungal cultures were treated with Ecoza topical foam, 1% once daily for 4 weeks.  Subjects applied a mean daily amount of 3.2 g of Ecoza topical foam, 1% to soles, toes, interdigital spaces and tops of both feet up to the ankles.  Blood samples were obtained on Day 28 at pre-dose and 7 h and 11 h post-dose. The mean ± SD econazole plasma concentration was 397 ± 289, 534 ± 745 and 575 ± 638 pg/mL at pre-dose and 7 h and 11 h post-dose, respectively.

                              Mechanism of Action
                           
                        
                        Econazole nitrate, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the fungistatic activity of econazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to econazole inhibition.
