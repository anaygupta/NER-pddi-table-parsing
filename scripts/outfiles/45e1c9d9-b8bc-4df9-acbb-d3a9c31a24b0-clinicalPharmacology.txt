                  Mechanism of ActionCiclesonide is a pro-drug that is enzymatically hydrolyzed to a 
pharmacologically active metabolite, C21-desisobutyryl-ciclesonide 
(des-ciclesonide or RM1) following intranasal application. Des-ciclesonide has 
anti-inflammatory activity with affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor that is 
120 times higher than the parent compound. 
                  The precise mechanism through which ciclesonide affects allergic rhinitis 
symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of 
effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, 
macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, 
leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic inflammation. 
                  
                  Pharmacokinetics
                     Absorption
                  
                  Ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide have negligible oral bioavailability (both 
less than 1%) due to low gastrointestinal absorption and high first-pass 
metabolism. The intranasal administration of ciclesonide at recommended doses 
results in negligible serum concentrations of ciclesonide. However, the known 
active metabolite (des-ciclesonide) is detected in the serum of some patients 
after nasal inhalation of ciclesonide. The bioanalytical assay used has a lower 
limit of quantification of 25 pg/mL and 10 pg/mL, for ciclesonide and 
des-ciclesonide, respectively
                  In healthy adults treated for two weeks with 50 to 800 mcg of ciclesonide 
nasal spray daily (n=6 in each treatment group), the peak serum concentrations 
of des-ciclesonide in all subjects were found to be below 30 pg/mL. Of those 
treated with 800 mcg and 400 mcg daily, 100% and 67% had detectable levels of 
des-ciclesonide, respectively. With daily doses of 200 mcg or less, detectable 
serum levels of des-ciclesonide were not observed. 
                  In pediatric subjects treated with 25 to 200 mcg of ciclesonide nasal spray 
daily, serum concentrations of des-ciclesonide were below 45 pg/mL, with the 
exception of one value of 64.5 pg/mL. In a 12-week study in children 6 to 11 
years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, des-ciclesonide was detected in 
50% of the subjects treated with 200 mcg and in 5% of those treated with 100 mcg 
ciclesonide nasal spray daily. In a 6-week study in children 2 to 5 years of age 
with perennial allergic rhinitis, des-ciclesonide was detected in 41%, 22%, and 
13% of the subjects treated with 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg ciclesonide nasal 
spray daily, respectively. 
                  
                     Distribution
                  
                  Following intravenous administration of 800 mcg of ciclesonide, the volumes 
of distribution of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide were approximately 2.9 L/kg 
and 12.1 L/kg, respectively. The percentage of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide 
bound to human plasma proteins averaged ≥ 99% each, with ≤ 1% of unbound drug 
detected in the systemic circulation. Des-ciclesonide is not significantly bound 
to human transcortin.
                  
                     Metabolism 
                  
                  Intranasal ciclesonide is hydrolyzed to a biologically active metabolite, 
des-ciclesonide, by esterases in the nasal mucosa. Des-ciclesonide undergoes 
further metabolism in the liver to additional metabolites mainly by the 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isozyme and to a lesser extent by CYP 2D6. The full 
range of potentially active metabolites of ciclesonide has not been 
characterized. After intravenous administration of 14C-ciclesonide, 19.3% of the resulting radioactivity in the 
plasma is accounted for by ciclesonide or des-ciclesonide; the remainder may be 
a result of other, as yet, unidentified multiple metabolites.
                  
                     Elimination 
                  
                  Following intravenous administration of 800 mcg of ciclesonide, the clearance 
values of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide were high (approximately 152 L/h and 
228 L/h, respectively). 14C-labeled ciclesonide was 
predominantly excreted via the feces after intravenous administration (66%) 
indicating that excretion through bile is the major route of elimination. 
Approximately 20% or less of drug related radioactivity was excreted in the 
urine.
                  
                     Special Populations
                  
                  The pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered ciclesonide have not been 
assessed in patient subpopulations because the resulting blood levels of 
ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide are insufficient for pharmacokinetic 
calculations. However, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that 
characteristics of des-ciclesonide after oral inhalation of ciclesonide were not 
appreciably influenced by a variety of subject characteristics such as body 
weight, age, race, and gender. Compared to healthy subjects, the systemic 
exposure (Cmax and AUC) in patients with liver impairment increased in the range 
of 1.4 to 2.7 fold after 1280 mcg ex-actuator ciclesonide by oral inhalation and 
dose adjustment in liver impairment is not necessary. Studies in renal impaired 
patients were not conducted. 
                  
                  PharmacodynamicsIn a 12-week study in children 6-11 years of age with perennial 
allergic rhinitis, daily doses of 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal 
Spray were compared to placebo nasal spray. Adrenal function was assessed by 
measurement of 24-hour urinary free cortisol (in 32 to 44 patients per group) 
and morning plasma cortisol levels (in 45 to 61 patients per group) before and 
after 12 consecutive weeks of treatment. The ciclesonide-treated groups had a 
numerically greater decline in 24-hour urinary free cortisol compared to the 
placebo treated group. The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from 
placebo in the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks were -0.81 (-4.0, 2.4), 
-0.08 (-3.1, 2.9), and -2.11 (-5.3, 1.1) mcg/day for 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 
mcg dose groups, respectively. The mean AM plasma cortisol value did not show 
any consistent treatment effect with differences (and 95% confidence intervals) 
from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks of 0.35 (-1.4, 2.1), 
0.12 (-1.5, 1.7), and -0.38 (-2.1, 1.3) mcg/dL for 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg 
dose groups respectively. In this study, serum was assayed for ciclesonide and 
des-ciclesonide (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: 
Pharmacokinetics: Absorption).
                  
                  In a 6-week study in children 2 to 5 years of age with perennial allergic 
rhinitis, daily doses of 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray 
were compared to placebo nasal spray. Adrenal function was assessed by 
measurement of 24-hour urinary free cortisol (in 15 to 22 patients per group) 
and morning plasma cortisol levels (in 28 to 30 patients per group) before and 
after 6 consecutive weeks of treatment. The ciclesonide-treated groups had a 
numerically greater decline in 24-hour urinary free cortisol compared to the 
placebo treated group. The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from 
placebo in the mean change from baseline to 6 weeks were -2.04 (-4.4, 0.3), 
-1.96 (-4.5, 0.6), and -1.76 (-4.3, 0.8) mcg/day for the 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 
25 mcg dose groups, respectively. The plasma cortisol also decreased numerically 
after treatment with ciclesonide. The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) 
from placebo in the mean change in plasma cortisol from baseline to 6 weeks were 
-1.04 (-2.7, 0.7), -0.36 (-2.1, 1.4), and -0.12 (-1.8, 1.6) mcg/dL for the 200 
mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively. In this study, serum was 
assayed for ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide (see CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics: Absorption). 
                  There are no adequately conducted studies in adults and adolescents that 
assess the effect of OMNARIS Nasal Spray on adrenal function.
