                  Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis retain phosphorus and
              can develop hyperphosphatemia. High serum phosphorus can precipitate serum calcium
              resulting in ectopic calcification. When the product of serum calcium and phosphorus
              concentrations (Ca x P) exceeds 55 mg /dL , there is an
              increased risk that ectopic calcification will occur. Hyperphosphatemia plays a role
              in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal insufficiency.

                  Treatment of hyperphosphatemia includes reduction in dietary intake of
              phosphate, inhibition of intestinal phosphate absorption with phosphate binders, and
              removal of phosphate with dialysis. Renagel taken with meals has been shown to
              decrease serum phosphorus concentrations in patients with CKD who are on
              dialysis.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Renagel contains sevelamer hydrochloride, a non-absorbed binding
                  crosslinked polymer. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the
                  polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and
                  interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding
                  phosphate in the dietary tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer hydrochloride
                  lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        In addition to effects on serum phosphate levels, sevelamer
                  hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids and in experimental animal models. Bile acid binding by ion exchange resins
                  is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol. Because sevelamer
                  binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce
                  absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In clinical trials of
                  sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by
                  15-31%. This effect is observed after 2 weeks. Triglycerides, HDL
                  cholesterol and albumin did not change.

                        A mass balance study using C-sevelamer hydrochloride in 16
                  healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not
                  systemically absorbed. No absorption studies have been performed in patients with
                  renal disease.
