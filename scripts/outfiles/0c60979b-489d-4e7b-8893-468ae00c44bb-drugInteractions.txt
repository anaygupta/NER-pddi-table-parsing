                        Ezogabine plasma levels may be reduced by concomitant administration of phenytoin or carbamazepine. An increase in dosage of POTIGA should be considered when adding phenytoin or carbamazepine.

                        The potentially significant interactions between POTIGA and concomitant AEDs are summarized in Table 5.

                        Alcohol increased systemic exposure to POTIGA. Patients should be advised of possible worsening of ezogabineâ€™s general dose-related adverse reactions if they take POTIGA with alcohol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                        Ezogabine has been shown to interfere with clinical laboratory assays of both serum and urine bilirubin, which can result in falsely elevated readings.
