                        The pressor effect of phenylephrine hydrochloride is increased in patients receiving:
                        
                           Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), such as selegiline.
                           β-adrenergic blockers
                           α-2 adrenergic agonists, such as clonidine
                           Steroids
                           Tricyclic antidepressants
                           Norepinephrine transport inhibitors, such as atomoxetine
                           Ergot alkaloids, such as methylergonovine maleate
                           Centrally-acting sympatholytic agents, such as guanfacine or reserpine
                           Atropine sulfate

                        α-adrenergic blocking agents, including phenothiazines (e.g., chlorpromazine) and amiodarone block phenylephrine and are in turn blocked by phenylephrine.
