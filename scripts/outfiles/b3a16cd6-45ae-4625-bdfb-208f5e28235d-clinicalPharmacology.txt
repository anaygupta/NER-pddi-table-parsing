 The mechanisms by which hyposensitization is achieved are not completely understood. It has been shown that repeated injections of appropriate allergenic extracts will ameliorate the intensity of allergic symptoms upon contact with the allergen.6, 7, 8, 9   Clinical studies which address the efficacy of immunotherapy are available. The allergens which have been studied are cat, mite, and some pollen extracts.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 
                  
IgE antibodies bound to receptors on mast cell membranes are required for the allergic reaction, and their level is probably related to serum IgE concentrations. Immunotherapy has been associated with decreased levels of IgE, and also with increases in allergen specific IgG "blocking" antibody. 
The histamine release response of circulating basophils to a specific allergen is reduced in some patients by immunotherapy, but the mechanism of this change is not yet clear. 
The relationships among changes in blocking antibody, reaginic antibody, and mediator-releasing cells, and successful immunotherapy need study and clarification. 
The CBER has evaluated the potency of eight grass pollen extract reference preparations and assigned potency units (BAU/mL) to each.5  The CBER clinical results follow in Table 1. Puncture data were obtained using a bifurcated needle.

Glycerinated (1:20 w/v) and Non-Glycerinated Pollen Extracts (1:10 w/v)
                  



*All CBER reference extracts contain 100,000 BAU/mL except Bermuda Grass which contains 10,000 BAU/mL.



**BAU/mL ranges between 69,990 and 143,100 are considered equivalent to the CBER 100,000 BAU/mL Standard, and between 6,990 and 14,310 for the CBER 10,000 BAU/mL Standard when assays are done in triplicate.
