                              Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PEG-3350 & ELECTROLYTES, and it is not known whether PEG-3350 & ELECTROLYTES can affect reproductive capacity or harm the fetus when administered to a pregnant patient. PEG-3350 & ELECTROLYTES should be given to a pregnant patient only if clearly needed.

These adverse events include upper GI bleeding from Mallory-Weiss Tear, esophageal perforation, asystole, sudden dyspnea with pulmonary edema, and "butterfly-like" infiltrate on chest x-ray after vomiting and aspirating PEG.
