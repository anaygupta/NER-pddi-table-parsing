                           Ergot-containing drugs
                           
                              Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions.  Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine [DHE] or methysergide) and eletriptan within 24 hours of each other is not recommended (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                           
                              Eletriptan is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 (see WARNINGS regarding use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
                           
                              Eletriptan is not a substrate for monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes; therefore, there is no expectation of an interaction between eletriptan and MAO inhibitors.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Propranolol
                           
                              The Cmax and AUC of eletriptan were increased by 10 and 33% respectively in the presence of propranolol.  No interactive increases in blood pressure were observed.  No dosage adjustment appears to be needed for patients taking propranolol (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome
                           
                              Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and triptans (See WARNINGS).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Other 5-HT1 agonists
                           
                              Concomitant use of other 5-HT1 agonists within 24 hours of RELPAX treatment is not recommended (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
