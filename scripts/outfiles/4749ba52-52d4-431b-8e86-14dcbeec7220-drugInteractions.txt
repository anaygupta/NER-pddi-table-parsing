                        No well-controlled studies have been performed on patients taking antiovulatory agents. The physician must use judgment and evaluate any patient taking antiovulatory drugs prior to initiating treatment with Sotradecol. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS section). 
                        Heparin should not be included in the same syringe as Sotradecol, since the two are incompatible.
