                        Use with caution and in reduced doses in patients currently receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, antihistamines; phenothiazines, barbiturates, other tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants and other CNS depressants (including alcohol). Respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result.
                        The analgesic effect of morphine is potentiated by chlorpromazine and methocarbamol.
                        Morphine may increase the anticoagulant activity of coumarin and other anticoagulants. Concurrent administration of cimetidine and morphine has been reported to precipitate apnea, confusion and muscle twitching in an isolated report.
                        
                           Monoamine oxidase inhibitors markedly potentiate the action of morphine.
                        
                           Neostigmine increases the intensity and duration of the analgesic action of morphine. When morphine is to be administered to patients receiving propiomazine (Largon), the dose of morphine should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half.
                        
                           Reserpine inhibits the analgesic action of morphine.
                        
                           Veratrum alkaloids may have additive effects, particularly on respiratory depression, when administered concurrently withmorphine.
                        
                           Atropineantagonizes morphine respiratory depression. Levallorphan and nalorphine antagonize morphine actions,principally the respiratory depression.
