                           Eliglustat is a CYP2D6 and CYP3A substrate.  Co-administration of CERDELGA with drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A may significantly increase the exposure to eliglustat and result in prolongation of the PR, QTc, and/or QRS cardiac interval, which could result in cardiac arrhythmias.  Consider potential drug interactions prior to and during therapy (5.1, 7.1) 
                           CYP2D6 IMs and PMs taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors: not recommended (7.1)
                           CYP2D6 PMs taking weak CYP3A inhibitors: not recommended (7.1)
                           CYP2D6 EMs and IMs taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors and CYP2D6 EMs taking strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors: reduce the dosage to 84 mg once daily (2.2, 7.1)
                           Eliglustat is an inhibitor of P-gp and CYP2D6.  Co-administration with drugs that are substrates for P-gp or CYP2D6 may result in increased concentrations of the other drug (7.2)

                     7.1	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CERDELGA
                     
                        Eliglustat is a CYP2D6 and CYP3A substrate.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 CYP2D6 and CYP3A Inhibitors
                              
                              Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A pathways may significantly increase the exposure to eliglustat and result in prolongation of the PR, QTc, and/or QRS cardiac interval which could result in cardiac arrhythmias:
                              
                                 Some inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP3A are contraindicated with CERDELGA depending on the patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status [see Contraindications (4)].
                                 Co-administration of CERDELGA with other CYP2D6 and CYP3A inhibitors may require dosage adjustment depending on the patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status to reduce the risk of potential significant adverse reactions (see Table 3 and Table 4).
                              
                              



                           



                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 CYP3A Inducers
                              
                              Co-administration of CERDELGA with strong CYP3A inducers significantly decreases eliglustat exposure.  Use of CERDELGA with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and St. John's Wort) is not recommended in EMs, IMs, and PMs.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Potential for CERDELGA to Affect Other Drugs
                     
                        Eliglustat is an inhibitor of P-gp and CYP2D6.  Co-administration of CERDELGA with drugs that are substrates for P-gp or CYP2D6 may result in increased concentrations of the concomitant drug as shown in Table 5.
