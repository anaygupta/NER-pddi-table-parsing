                        Metronidazole is an antibacterial drug [see Clinical Pharmacology, Microbiology (12.4)]

                           Healthy Subjects
                        
                        Following a single, intravaginal 5 gram dose of metronidazole vaginal gel (equivalent to 37.5 mg of metronidazole) to 38 healthy female subjects, a mean maximum serum metronidazole concentration of 281 ng/mL was reported (range: 134 to 464 ng/mL). The average time to achieve this Cmax was 9.5 hours (range: 4 to 17 hours) after dosing with metronidazole vaginal gel. This Cmax is approximately 2% of the mean maximum serum concentration reported in healthy subjects administered a single, oral 500 mg dose of metronidazole (mean Cmax = 12,785 ng/mL).
                        The extent of exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] of metronidazole, when administered as a single intravaginal 5 gram dose of metronidazole vaginal gel (equivalent to 37.5 mg of metronidazole), was 5,989 ng•hr/mL (range: 2,797 to 10,515 ng•hr/mL). This AUC0-
                           ∞ is approximately 5% of the reported AUC of metronidazole following a single oral 500 mg dose of metronidazole approximately 125,000 ng•hr/mL.
                        
                           Patients with Bacterial Vaginosis
                        
                        Following single and multiple 5 gram doses of a similar metronidazole vaginal gel product to 4 patients with bacterial vaginosis, a mean maximum serum metronidazole concentration of 214 ng/mL on day one and 294 ng/mL (range: 228 to 349 ng/mL) on day five were reported. Steady state metronidazole serum concentrations following oral dosages of 400 to 500 mg BID have been reported to range from 6,000 to 20,000 ng/mL.

                           Mechanism of Action
                        
                        The intracellular targets of action of metronidazole on anaerobes are largely unknown. The 5-nitro group of metronidazole is reduced by metabolically active anaerobes, and studies have demonstrated that the reduced form of the drug interacts with bacterial DNA. However, it is not clear whether interaction with DNA alone is an important component in the bactericidal action of metronidazole on anaerobic organisms. 
                        
                           Activity In Vitro
                           
                        
                        Metronidazole is an antibacterial agent active in vitro against most strains of the following organisms that have been reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis:
                        
                           Bacteroides spp.
                        
                           Gardnerella vaginalis
                        
                        
                           Mobiluncus spp.
                        
                           Peptostreptococcus spp.
                        Standard methodology for the susceptibility testing of the potential bacterial vaginosis pathogens, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp., has not been defined. Culture and sensitivity testing of bacteria are not routinely performed to establish the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [see Clinical Studies (14)].
