                  No specific interaction studies have been conducted with CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors: Do not use. May potentiate the effect of pseudoephedrine on vascular system. (7.1)
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
                     
                        CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should not be used in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy or within fourteen (14) days of stopping such treatment because the action of pseudoephedrine a component of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release tablets on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents. (see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions 5.3)
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Beta-adrenergic blocking agents
                     
                        The antihypertensive effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa, and reserpine, may be reduced by sympathomimetics such as pseudoephedrine. Exercise caution when using CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets with these agents.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	Digitalis
                     
                        Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. Exercise caution when using CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets with these agents.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4	Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4
                     
                        In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with ketoconazole, erythromycin, or azithromycin resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5	Fluoxetine
                     
                        In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6	Cimetidine
                     
                        In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with cimetidine a histamine H2-receptor antagonist resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
