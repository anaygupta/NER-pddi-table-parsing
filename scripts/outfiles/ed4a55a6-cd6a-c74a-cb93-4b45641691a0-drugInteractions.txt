                                 Hypotension — Patients on Diuretic Therapy
                                 
                                    Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with enalapril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with enalapril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, provide medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour. (See

                                    The antihypertensive effect of enalapril is augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause rennin release (e.g., diuretics).
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents
                                 
                                    In some patients with compromised renal function who are being treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the coadministration of enalapril may result in a further deterioration of renal function. These effects are usually reversible.
                                    In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was administered to hypertensive patients receiving enalapril maleate. In this study there was no evidence of a blunting of the antihypertensive action of enalapril maleate. However, reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors.

                                    Enalapril has been used concomitantly with beta adrenergic-blocking agents, methyldopa, nitrates, calcium-blocking agents, hydralazine and prazosin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium
                                 
                                    Enalapril attenuates diuretic-induced potassium loss. Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Lithium
                                 
                                    Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. A few cases of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant enalapril and lithium and were reversible upon discontinuation of both drugs. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if enalapril is administered concomitantly with lithium.

                                    Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Hydrochlorothiazide
                           
                              When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics:
                              
                                 Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics — potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.
                              
                                 Antidiabetic Drugs (Oral Agents and Insulin) — dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.
                              
                                 Other Antihypertensive Drugs — additive effect or potentiation.
                              
                                 Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins — Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.
                              
                                 Corticosteroids, ACTH — intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.
                              
                                 Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine) — possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use.
                              
                                 Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine) — possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.
                              
                                 Lithium — should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.
                              
                                 Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs — In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
