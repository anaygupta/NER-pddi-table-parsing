                           In vitro studies indicate that tramadol is unlikely to inhibit the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of other drugs when tramadol is administered concomitantly at therapeutic doses. Tramodol does not appear to induce its own metabolism in humans, since observed maximal plasma concentrations after multiple oral doses are higher than expected based on single-dose data. Tamadol is a mild inducer of selected drug metabolism pathways measured in animals.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Use with Carbamazepine
                           
                           
                              Patients taking carbamazepine may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol hydrochloride. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride and carbamazepine is not recommended.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Use with Quinidine
                              
                           
                           
                              Tramadol is metabolized to M1 by CYP2D6. Quinidine is a selective inhibitor of that isoenzyme, so that concomitant administration of quinidine and tramadol hydrochloride results in increased concentrations of tramadol and reduced concentrations of M1. The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Use with Inhibitors of CYP2D6
                           
                           
                              
                                 In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Use with Cimetidine
                              
                           
                           
                              Concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride with cimetidine does not result in clinically significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics. Therefore, no alteration of the tramadol hydrochloride dosage regimen is recommended.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Use with MAO Inhibitors
                           
                           
                              Interactions with MAO Inhibitors, due to interference with detoxification mechanisms, have been reported for some centrally acting drugs (see WARNINGS: Use with MAO Inhibitors).

                              Post-marketing surveillance has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity and alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times.
