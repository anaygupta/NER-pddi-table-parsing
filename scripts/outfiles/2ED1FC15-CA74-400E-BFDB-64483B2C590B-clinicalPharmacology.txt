CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
The sulfhydryl groups of dimercaprol form complexes with certain heavy metals thus preventing or reversing the metallic binding of sulfhydryl-containing enzymes. The complex is excreted. The sustained presence of dimercaprol promotes continued excretion of the metallic poisons - arsenic, gold and mercury. It is also used in combination with Edetate Calcium Disodium Injection USP to promote the excretion of lead.
