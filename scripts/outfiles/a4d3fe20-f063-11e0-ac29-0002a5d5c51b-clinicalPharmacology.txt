                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist used for dilation of the pupil due to its vasoconstrictor and mydriatic action. Phenylephrine possesses predominantly α-adrenergic effects. In the eye, phenylephrine acts locally as a potent vasoconstrictor and mydriatic, by constricting ophthalmic blood vessels and the radial muscle of the iris.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2.	Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Maximal mydriasis occurs in 20 to 90 minutes with recovery after 3 to 8 hours.
                        Systemic absorption of sufficient quantities of phenylephrine may lead to systemic α-adrenergic effects, such as rise in blood pressure which may be accompanied by a reflex atropine-sensitive bradycardia.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The systemic exposure following topical administration of phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution has not been studied. A higher systemic absorption is expected for the 10% solution than the 2.5% solution and when the corneal barrier function is compromised.
