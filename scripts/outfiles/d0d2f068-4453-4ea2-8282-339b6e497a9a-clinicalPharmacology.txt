                  Pharmacology: Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF is an osmotic agent which causes water to be
                  retained with the stool. Essentially, complete recovery of Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF was
                  shown in normal subjects without constipation. Attempts at recovery of Polyethylene Glycol
                  3350 NF in constipated patients resulted in incomplete and highly variable recovery. In vitro
                  study showed indirectly that Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF was not fermented into hydrogen
                  or methane by the colonic microflora in human feces. Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF appears
                  to have no effect on the active absorption or secretion of glucose or electrolytes. There is no
                  evidence of tachyphylaxis.
                  
                     CLINICAL TRIALS
                  
                  In one study, patients with less than 3 bowel movements per week were randomized to
                  Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF, 17 grams, or placebo for 14 days. An increase in bowel
                  movement frequency was observed for both treatment groups during the first week of
                  treatment. Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF was statistically superior to placebo during the
                  second week of treatment. In another study, patients with 3 bowel movements or less per
                  week and/or less than 300 grams of stool per week were randomized to 2 dose levels of
                  Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF or placebo for 10 days each. Success was defined by an
                  increase in both bowel movement frequency and daily stool weight. For both parameters,
                  superiority of the 17 gram dose of Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF over placebo was
                  demonstrated.
