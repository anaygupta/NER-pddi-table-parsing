                  Methscopolamine bromide is an anticholinergic agent which possesses most of the pharmacologic actions of that drug class. These include reduction in volume and total acid content of gastric secretion, inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, inhibition of salivary excretion, dilation of the pupil and inhibition of accommodation with resulting blurring of vision.
