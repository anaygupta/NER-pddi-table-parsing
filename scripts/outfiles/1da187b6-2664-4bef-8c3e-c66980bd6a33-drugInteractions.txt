                     7.1 Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides 
                     
                        Concomitant use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and antacids decreased plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid (MPA). It is recommended that mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and antacids not be administered simultaneously [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Azathioprine 
                     
                        Given that azathioprine and MMF inhibit purine metabolism, it is recommended that mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine or MMF.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Cholestyramine, Bile Acid Sequestrates, Oral Activated Charcoal and Other Drugs that Interfere with Enterohepatic Recirculation 
                     
                        Drugs that interrupt enterohepatic recirculation may decrease MPA plasma concentrations when coadministered with MMF. Therefore, do not administer mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation or drugs that may bind bile acids, e.g., bile acid sequestrates or oral activated charcoal, because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Sevelamer 
                     
                        Concomitant administration of sevelamer and MMF may decrease MPA plasma concentrations. Sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Cyclosporine 
                     
                        Cyclosporine inhibits the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA, and therefore, MPA plasma concentrations may be decreased when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are coadministered with cyclosporine. Clinicians should be aware that there is also a potential change of MPA plasma concentrations after switching from cyclosporine to other immunosuppressive drugs or from other immunosuppressive drugs to cyclosporine in patients concomitantly receiving mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6 Norfloxacin and Metronidazole 
                     
                        MPA plasma concentrations may be decreased when MMF is administrated with norfloxacin and metronidazole. Therefore, mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. Although there will be no effect on MPA plasma concentrations when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole when given separately [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.7 Rifampin
                     
                        The concomitant administration of MMF and rifampin may decrease MPA plasma concentrations. Therefore, mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.8 Hormonal Contraceptives 
                     
                        In a drug interaction study, mean levonorgestrel AUC was decreased by 15% when coadministered with MMF. Although mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of oral contraceptives, it is recommended to coadminister mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets with hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution, and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used [see 
                              Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.9 Acyclovir (Valacyclovir), Ganciclovir (Valganciclovir), and Other Drugs that Undergo Renal Tubular Secretion 
                     
                        The coadministration of MMF and acyclovir or ganciclovir may increase plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) and acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir as their coexistence competes for tubular secretion. Both acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir and MPAG concentrations will be also increased in the presence of renal impairment. Acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir may be taken with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets; however, during the period of treatment, physicians should monitor blood cell counts [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.10 Ciprofloxacin, Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid and Other Drugs that Alter the Gastrointestinal Flora 
                     
                        Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora such as ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid may interact with MMF by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets is concomitantly administered with ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unclear; however, no dose adjustment of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets is needed when coadministered with these drugs [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                        Administration of a pantoprazole at a dose of 40 mg twice daily for 4 days to healthy volunteers did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets [see
