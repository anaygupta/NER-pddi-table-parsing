CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Isosorbide is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It is essentially nonmetabolized, and in the circulation, it contributes to the tonicity of the blood until it is eliminated by the kidney unchanged. While in the blood, isosorbide acts as an osmotic agent to promote redistribution of water toward the circulation with ultimate elimination in the urine. The physical action of ISMOTIC is similar to that of other osmotic drugs.
