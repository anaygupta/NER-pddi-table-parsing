                           There is a potential additive effect of the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving both oral and topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (7.1).   
                           Rare instances of acid-base alterations have occurred with high-dose salicylate therapy (7.2).  
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
7.1	Oral Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors
                     
                        There is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and AZOPT® (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1%. The concomitant administration of AZOPT® (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
7.2	High-Dose Salicylate Therapy
                     
                        Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may produce acid-base and electrolyte alterations. These alterations were not reported in the clinical trials with brinzolamide. However, in patients treated with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, rare instances of acid-base alterations have occurred with high-dose salicylate therapy. Therefore, the potential for such drug interactions should be considered in patients receiving AZOPT® (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1%.
