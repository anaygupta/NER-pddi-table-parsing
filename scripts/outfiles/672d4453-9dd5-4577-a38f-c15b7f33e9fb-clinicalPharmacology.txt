                  Sorbitol and mannitol are hexitols and are nonelectrolytes. A solution of these constituents in water is therefore nonconductive and suitable for urologic irrigation during electrosurgical procedures. A 3% (approx.) total concentration of sorbitol-mannitol contains sufficient solute to minimize the risk of intravascular hemolysis which can occur from absorption of plain water through open prostatic veins during transurethral resection (TUR). Any solution that is absorbed intravascularly during transurethral prostatic or bladder surgery, although variable in amount depending primarily on the extent of surgery, will be excreted by the kidney. When absorbed intravascularly, sorbitol and mannitol act as osmotic diuretics.
                  Intravascular absorption of sorbitol has been shown to produce elevations of serum lactate after TUR above preoperative values owing to sorbitolâ€™s favored metabolism to lactate from pyruvate. Increased lactate levels were not sufficient to produce evidence of metabolic acidosis. Mannitol is only slightly metabolized and rapidly excreted by the kidney.
