                     7.1 Erythromycin
                     
                        Clindamycin Phosphate Foam, 1% should not be used in combination with topical or oral erythromycin-containing products due to possible antagonism to its clindamycin component. In vitro studies have shown antagonism between these two antimicrobials. The clinical significance of this in vitro antagonism is not known.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents
                     
                        Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, Clindamycin Phosphate Foam, 1% should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.
