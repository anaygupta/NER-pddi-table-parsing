                  No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with LYSTEDA.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both LYSTEDA and tissue plasminogen activators. (7.2)
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Hormonal Contraceptives
                     
                        Because LYSTEDA is antifibrinolytic, concomitant use of hormonal contraception and LYSTEDA may further exacerbate the increased thrombotic risk associated with combination hormonal contraceptives.  For this reason, concomitant use of LYSTEDA with combination hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see

                     7.2	Tissue Plasminogen Activators
                     
                        Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both LYSTEDA and tissue plasminogen activators.  Therefore, exercise caution if a woman taking LYSTEDA therapy requires tissue plasminogen activators.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates
                     
                        LYSTEDA is not recommended for women taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see 
                              Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)

                     7.4	All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin)
                     
                        Exercise caution when prescribing LYSTEDA to women with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see 
                              Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
