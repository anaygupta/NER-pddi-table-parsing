CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
In animals, diazepam appears to act on parts of the limbic system, the thalamus and hypothalamus, and induces calming effects. Diazepam, unlike chlorpromazine and reserpine, has no demonstrable peripheral autonomic blocking action, nor does it produce extrapyramidal side effects. However, animals treated with diazepam do have a transient ataxia at higher doses. Diazepam was found to have transient cardiovascular depressor effects in dogs. Long-term experiments in rats revealed no disturbances of endocrine function. Injections into animals have produced localized irritation of tissue surrounding injection sites and some thickening of veins after intravenous use.





Pharmacokinetics (autoinjector):
A study performed in 24 healthy male subjects comparing the I.M. Injection of 10 mg of diazepam in the mid-anterior/lateral thigh by the autoinjector versus 10 mg I.M. by a syringe (operated manually) indicates that the mean percent availability of the drug from the autoinjector is 100% of that obtained from the syringe.In addition, the mean Cmax value from the autoinjector was 314 ng/mL (c.v. = 18.7%, range 185 to 439 ng/mL) and 48.6 ng/mL (c.v. = 19.8%, range 29.4 to 69.7 ng/mL) for diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, respectively, while the syringe gave corresponding values of 287 ng/mL (c.v. = 18.9%, range 174 to 378 ng/mL) and 47.2 ng/mL (c.v. = 19.4%, range 33.1 to 61.2 ng/mL) for diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, respectively. The corresponding mean Tmax values were 1.47 hours (c.v. = 69.9%, range 0.8 to 6 hours) and 61.0 hours (c.v. = 56.8%, range 24 to 144 hours) for diazepam and desmethyldiazepam for the autoinjector whereas the syringe gave values of 1.31 hours (c.v. = 32%, range 0.7 to 2.0 hours) and 54.5 hours (c.v. = 47.3%, range 12 to 96 hours) for diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, respectively.max value from the autoinjector was 314 ng/mL (c.v. = 18.7%, range 185 to 439 ng/mL) and 48.6 ng/mL (c.v. = 19.8%, range 29.4 to 69.7 ng/mL) for diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, respectively, while the syringe gave corresponding values of 287 ng/mL (c.v. = 18.9%, range 174 to 378 ng/mL) and 47.2 ng/mL (c.v. = 19.4%, range 33.1 to 61.2 ng/mL) for diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, respectively.
