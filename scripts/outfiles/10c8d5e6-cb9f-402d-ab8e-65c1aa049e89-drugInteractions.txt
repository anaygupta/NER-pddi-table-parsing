                        There have been no clinical studies designed to evaluate the interaction of riluzole with other drugs.
                        As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms is a possibility.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Hepatotoxic Drugs
                           
                              The clinical trials in ALS excluded patients on concomitant medications which were potentially hepatotoxic, (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine). Accordingly, there is no information about the safety of administering RILUTEK in conjunction with such medications. If the practitioner chooses to prescribe such a combination, caution should be exercised.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Drugs Highly Bound To Plasma Proteins
                           
                              Riluzole is highly bound (96%) to plasma proteins, binding mainly to serum albumin and to lipoproteins. The effect of riluzole (up to 5 mcg/mL) on warfarin (5 mcg/mL) binding did not show any displacement of warfarin. Conversely, riluzole binding was unaffected by the addition of warfarin, digoxin, imipramine and quinine at high therapeutic concentrations.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Effect of Other Drugs On Riluzole Metabolism
                           
                              
                                 In vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations suggest that CYP 1A2 is the principal isozyme involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole and, therefore, potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP 1A2 activity. Potential inhibitors of CYP 1A2 (e.g., caffeine, phenacetin, theophylline, amitriptyline, and quinolones) could decrease the rate of riluzole elimination, while inducers of CYP 1A2 (e.g., cigarette smoke, charcoal-broiled food, rifampicin, and omeprazole) could increase the rate of riluzole elimination.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Effect of Riluzole On the Metabolism of Other Drugs
                           
                              CYP 1A2 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole; potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given concurrently with other agents which are also metabolized primarily by CYP 1A2 (e.g., theophylline, caffeine, and tacrine). Currently, it is not known whether riluzole has any potential for enzyme induction in humans.
