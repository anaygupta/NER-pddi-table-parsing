                        Systemic toxic effects are thought to be additive and potentially synergistic with lidocaine and tetracaine. Use SYNERA with caution in the following circumstances:
• in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) (7.1)
• when used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents (7.2)
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                       7.1 Antiarrhythmic Drugs
                     
                        SYNERA should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the systemic toxic effects are thought to be additive and potentially synergistic with lidocaine and tetracaine.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                       7.2 Local Anesthetics
                     
                        When SYNERA is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations should be considered since the systemic toxic effects are thought to be additive and potentially synergistic with lidocaine and tetracaine.
