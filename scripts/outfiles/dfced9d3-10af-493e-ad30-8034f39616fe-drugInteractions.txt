                           Antacids:
                           
                              The simultaneous oral administration of Sodium Polystrene Sulfonate with nonabsorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives may reduce the resin's potassium exchange capability.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Non-absorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives:
                           
                              Systemic alkalosis has been reported after cation-exchange resins were administered orally in combination with nonabsorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum carbonate. Magnesium hydroxide should not be administered with Sodium Plystyrene Sulfonate. One case of grand mal seizure has been reported in a patient with chronic hypocalcemia of renal failure who was given sodium polystyrene sulfonate with magnesium hydroxide as a laxative.
                              Intestinal obstruction due to concretions of aluminum hydroxide when used in combination with sodium polystyrene sulfonate has been reported.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Digitalis:
                           
                              The toxic effects of digitalis on the heart, especially various ventricular arrhythmias and A-V nodal dissociation, are likely to be exaggerated by hypokalemia, even in the face of serum digoxin concentrations in the "normal range".

                           Sorbitol:
                           
                              Concomitant use of Sorbitol with Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate has been implicated in cases of chronic necrosis. Therefore, concomitant administration is not recommended.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Lithium:
                           
                              Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate may decrease absorption of lithium.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Thyroxine:
                           
                              Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate may decrease absorption of thyroxine.
