                   Potassium citrate is absorbed and metabolized to potassium bicarbonate, thus acting as a systemic alkalizer.  The effects are essentially those of chlorides before absorption and those of bicarbonates subsequently.  Oxidation is virtually complete so that less than 5% of the potassium citrate is excreted in the urine unchanged.
