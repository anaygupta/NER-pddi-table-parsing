                  Like other topical corticosteroids, betamethasone dipropionate 
has anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The 
mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, 
is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of 
phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called 
lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of 
potent mediators of inflammation, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, by 
inhibiting the release of their common pre-cursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic 
acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.
                  
                  
                  
                     Pharmacokinetics: The extent of 
percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors 
including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive 
dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours have not been demonstrated to 
increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly 
enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact 
skin. In addition, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may 
increase percutaneous absorption. Studies performed with betamethasone 
dipropionate gel (augmented) indicate that it is in the super-high range of 
potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids.
