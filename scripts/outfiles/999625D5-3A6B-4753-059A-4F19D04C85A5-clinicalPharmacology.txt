CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
NOVOCAIN stabilizes the neuronal membrane and prevents
the initiation and transmission of nerve impulses, thereby effecting
local anesthesia. NOVOCAIN lacks surface anesthetic activity. The
onset of action is rapid (2 to 5 minutes) and the duration of action
is relatively short (average 1 to 1½ hours), depending upon
the anesthetic technique, the type of block, the concentration, and
the individual patient.NOVOCAIN is readily
absorbed following parenteral administration and is rapidly hydrolyzed
by plasma cholinesterase to aminobenzoic acid and diethylaminoethanol.A vasoconstrictor may be added to the solution of NOVOCAIN
to promote local hemostasis, delay systemic absorption, and increase
duration of anesthesia.
