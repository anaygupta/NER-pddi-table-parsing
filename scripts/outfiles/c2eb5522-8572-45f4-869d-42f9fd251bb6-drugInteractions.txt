                     7.1 Coumarin and Coumarin Derivatives
                     
                        The soybean oil present in PERIKABIVEN® has vitamin K1. Vitamin K1 can reverse the anticoagulant activity of coumarin or coumarin derivatives, which work by blocking recycling of vitamin K1. Monitoring for anticoagulant activity is recommended in patients who are on both PERIKABIVEN® and coumarin or coumarin derivatives.
