                     n vivo drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted with valganciclovir. However, because valganciclovir is rapidly and extensively converted to ganciclovir, drug-drug interactions associated with ganciclovir will be expected for valganciclovir . Established and other potentially significant drug interactions conducted with ganciclovir are listed in Table 8.

                           Zidovudine: Potential to cause neutropenia and anemia. Monitor with frequent tests of white blood cell counts with differential and hemoglobin levels (7). 
                           Probenecid: May increase ganciclovir levels. Monitor for evidence of ganciclovir toxicity (7). 
                           Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): May increase ganciclovir concentrations and levels of MMF metabolites in patients with renal impairment. Monitor for ganciclovir and MMF toxicity (7). 
                           Didanosine: May increase didanosine concentrations. Monitor for didanosine toxicity (7).
