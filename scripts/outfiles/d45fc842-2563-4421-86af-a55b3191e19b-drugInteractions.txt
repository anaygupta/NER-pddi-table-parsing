                           Coadministration with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole)
significantly increases saxagliptin concentrations. Recommend limiting ONGLYZA
dose to 2.5 mg once daily. (2.3, 7.1)
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 Enzymes
                     
                        Ketoconazole significantly increased saxagliptin
exposure. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin
are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin,
indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and
telithromycin). The dose of ONGLYZA should be limited to 2.5 mg when coadministered
with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor. [See
