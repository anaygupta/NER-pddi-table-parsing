                     12.1  Mechanism of Action

                     
                        Mifepristone is a selective antagonist of the progesterone receptor at low doses and blocks the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-II) at higher doses. Mifepristone has high affinity for the GR-II receptor but little affinity for the GR-I (MR, mineralocorticoid) receptor. In addition, mifepristone appears to have little or no affinity for estrogen, muscarinic, histaminic, or monoamine receptors.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2  Pharmacodynamics

                     
                        Because mifepristone acts at the receptor level to block the effects of cortisol, its antagonistic actions affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in such a way as to further increase circulating cortisol levels while, at the same time, blocking their effects.

                        Mifepristone and the three active metabolites have greater affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (100%, 61%, 48%, and 45%, respectively) than either dexamethasone (23%) or cortisol (9%).

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3  Pharmacokinetics

                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Absorption
                              
                              Following oral administration, time to peak plasma concentrations of mifepristone occurred between 1 and 2 hours following single dose, and between 1 and 4 hours following multiple doses of 600 mg of Korlym in healthy volunteers. Mean plasma concentrations of three active metabolites of mifepristone peak between 2 and 8 hours after multiple doses of 600 mg/day, and the combined concentrations of the metabolites exceed that of the parent mifepristone. Exposure to mifepristone is substantially less than dose proportional. Time to steady state is within 2 weeks, and the mean (SD) half-life of the parent mifepristone was 85 (61) hours following multiple doses of 600 mg/day of Korlym.

                              Studies evaluating the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of Korlym demonstrate a significant increase in plasma levels of mifepristone when dosed with food. To achieve consistent plasma drug concentrations, patients should be instructed to always take their medication with meals.

                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Distribution
                              
                              Mifepristone is highly bound to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and approaches saturation at doses of 100 mg (2.5 μM) or more. Mifepristone and its metabolites also bind to albumin and are distributed to other tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). As determined in vitro by equilibrium dialysis, binding of mifepristone and its three active metabolites to human plasma proteins was concentration-dependent. Binding was approximately 99.2% for mifepristone, and ranged from 96.1 to 98.9% for the three active metabolites at clinically relevant concentrations.

                              Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) has been shown to be involved in mifepristone metabolism in human liver microsomes. Two of the known active metabolites are the product of demethylation (one monodemethylated and one di-demethylated), while a third active metabolite results from hydroxylation (monohydroxylated).

                              Excretion is primarily (approximately 90%) via the fecal route.

                                       Renal Impairment
                                    
                                    The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] < 30 mL/min, but not on dialysis) was evaluated following multiple doses of 1200 mg Korlym for 7 days. Mean exposure to mifepristone increased 31%, with similar or smaller increases in metabolite exposure as compared to subjects with normal renal function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min). There was large variability in the exposure of mifepristone and its metabolites in subjects with severe renal impairment as compared to subjects with normal renal function (geometric least square mean ratio [CI] for AUC of mifepristone: 1.21 [0.71-2.06]; metabolite 1: 1.43 [0.84-2.44]; metabolite 2: 1.18 [0.64-2.17] and metabolite 3: 1.19 [0.71-1.99]). No change in the initial dose of Korlym is needed for renal impairment; the maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day.

                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Hepatic Impairment
                                    
                                    The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was evaluated in a single- and multiple-dose study (600 mg for 7 days). The pharmacokinetics in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment was similar to those with normal hepatic function. There was large variability in the exposure of mifepristone and its metabolites in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (geometric least square mean ratio [CI] for AUC of mifepristone: 1.02 [0.59-1.76]; metabolite 1: 0.95 [0.52-1.71]; metabolite 2: 1.37 [0.71-2.62] and metabolite 3: 0.62 [0.33-1.16]).  Due to limited information on safety in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg per day. The pharmacokinetics of mifepristone in patients with severe hepatic disease has not been studied. Korlym is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic disease.

                                    In vitro studies indicate a potential for CYP-mediated drug interactions by mifepristone and/or its metabolites with substrates of CYP2A6, CYP2C8/2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. In vitro studies also indicated an interaction potential for drug transport mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). In vitro studies indicate mifepristone metabolism is mediated by CYP3A, and that mifepristone also inhibits and induces CYP3A.
