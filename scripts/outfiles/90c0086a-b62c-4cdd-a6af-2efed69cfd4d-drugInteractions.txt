                        Because ORAP prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, an additive effect on QT interval would be anticipated if administered with other drugs, such as phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants or antiarrhythmic agents, which prolong the QT interval.  Accordingly, pimozide should not be given with dofetilide, sotalol, quinidine, other Class Ia and III anti-arrhythmics, mesoridazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, droperidol, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, halofantrine, mefloquine, pentamidine, arsenic trioxide, levomethadyl acetate, dolasetron mesylate, probucol, tacrolimus, ziprasidone, or other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects.  Also, the use of macrolide antibiotics in patients with prolonged QT intervals has been rarely associated with ventricular arrhythmias.  Such concomitant administration should not be undertaken (see 
                              CONTRAINDICATIONS
                           ).
                        Since ORAP is partly metabolized via CYP 3A4, it should not be administered concomitantly with inhibitors of this metabolic system, such as azole antifungal agents and protease inhibitor drugs (see 
                              CONTRAINDICATIONS
                           ).
                        Pimozide and Celexa: In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with racemic citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone.  Racemic citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or Cmax of pimozide.  The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known.  Concomitant use of pimozide and Celexa or Lexapro is contraindicated (See 
                              CONTRAINDICATIONS
                           ).
                        CYP 2D6 inhibitors: In healthy subjects, co-administration of pimozide 2 mg (single dose) and paroxetine 60 mg resulted in a 151% increase in pimozide AUC and a 62% increase in pimozide Cmax compared to pimozide administered alone. The increase in pimozide AUC and Cmax is related to the CYP 2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine. Concomitant use of pimozide and paroxetine or other strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors are contraindicated (see 
                              CONTRAINDICATIONS
                           ). As CYP 1A2 may also contribute to the metabolism of ORAP, prescribers should be aware of the theoretical potential for drug interactions with inhibitors of this enzymatic system.
                        ORAP may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants, including analgesics, sedatives, anxiolytics, and alcohol.
                        Rare case reports have suggested possible additive effects of pimozide and fluoxetine leading to bradycardia.
                        Concomitant administration of pimozide and sertraline should be contraindicated (See 
                              Contraindications
                           ).
