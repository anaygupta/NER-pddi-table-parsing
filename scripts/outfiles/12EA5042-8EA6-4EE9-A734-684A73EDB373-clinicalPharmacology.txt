PharmacokineticsPharmacokineticsPharmacokineticsPharmacokineticsThe pharmacokinetics of acyclovir after oral administration have been evaluated in healthy volunteers and in immunocompromised patients with herpes simplex or varicella-zoster virus infection. Acyclovir pharmacokinetic parameters are summarised in Table 1.




*Bioavailability decreases with increasing dose.In one multiple-dose, cross-over study in healthy subjects (n=23), it was shown that increases in plasma acyclovir concentrations were less than dose proportional with increasing dose, as shown in Table 2. The decrease in bioavailability is a function of the dose and not the dosage form. 




 There was no effect of food on the absorption of acyclovir (n=6); therefore, Acyclovir Capsules and Tablets may be administered with or without food.The only known urinary metabolite is 9-[(carboxymethoxy)methyl]guanine.
