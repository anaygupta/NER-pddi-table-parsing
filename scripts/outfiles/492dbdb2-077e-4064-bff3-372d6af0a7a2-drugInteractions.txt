                  Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping Herceptin may be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction because of trastuzumab's long wash out period based on population PK analysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                     ].  If possible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping Herceptin.  If anthracyclines are used, the patient's cardiac function should be monitored carefully.
