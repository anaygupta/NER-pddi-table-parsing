<footnote>The phenotypic susceptibility score (PSS) was defined as the total number of active antiretroviral drugs in the background therapy to which a subject's baseline viral isolate showed sensitivity in phenotypic resistance tests. Each drug in the background therapy was scored as a '1' or '0' based on whether the viral isolate was considered susceptible or resistant to that drug, respectively. In the calculation of the PSS, darunavir was counted as a sensitive antiretroviral if the FC was less than or equal to 10; enfuvirtide was counted as a sensitive antiretroviral if it had not been used previously. INTELENCE<sup>®</sup> was not included in this calculation.</footnote>
