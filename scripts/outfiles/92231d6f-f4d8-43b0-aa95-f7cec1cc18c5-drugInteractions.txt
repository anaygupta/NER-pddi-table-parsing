                  Drugs or herbal products that induce enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize progestins may decrease the serum concentrations of progestins. 
                  Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the serum concentration of levonorgestrel include: 
                  
                     
                        •barbiturates

                  Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the serum concentrations of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
