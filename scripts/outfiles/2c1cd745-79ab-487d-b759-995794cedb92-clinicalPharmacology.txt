                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The mode of action of Veregen® involved in the clearance of genital and perianal warts is unknown.  In vitro, sinecatechins had anti-oxidative activity; the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

                        The pharmacodynamics of Veregen® is unknown.

								Systemic exposure to EGCg, EGC, ECg, and EC were evaluated following either topical
								application of Veregen® to subjects with external genital and perianal warts (250 mg applied 3
								times a day for 7 days) or following oral ingestion of green tea beverage (500 mL ingested 3
								times a day for 7 days). Following topical application of Veregen®, plasma concentration of all 4
								catechins were below the limit of quantification (<5 ng/mL) on Day 1. After application of
								Veregen® for 7 days, plasma EGC, ECg, and EC concentrations were below the limit of
								quantification while plasma concentration of EGCg were measurable in 2 out of 20 subjects. The
								mean maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of EGCg was 10.1 ng/mL and the mean area under
								the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of EGCg was 52.2 ng*h/mL in these 2 subjects. Oral
								ingestion of green tea beverage resulted in measurable concentration of EGCg in all subjects on
								both Day 1 and Day 7, with mean (SD) Cmax of 23.0 (12.0) ng/mL and AUC of 104.6 (39.0)
								ng*h/mL on Day 7.
