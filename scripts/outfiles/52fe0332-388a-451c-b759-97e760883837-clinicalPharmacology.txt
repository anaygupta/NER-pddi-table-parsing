                     12.1  Mechanism of Action

                     
                        After topical ocular dosing, nepafenac penetrates the cornea and 
is converted by ocular tissue hydrolases to amfenac, a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug. Amfenac is thought to inhibit the action of 
prostaglandin H synthase (cyclooxygenase), an enzyme required for prostaglandin 
production.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3  Pharmacokinetics

                     
                        Low but quantifiable plasma concentrations of nepafenac and 
amfenac were observed in the majority of subjects 2 and 3 hours postdose, 
respectively, following bilateral topical ocular three-times-daily dosing of 
nepafenac ophthalmic suspension, 0.1%. The mean steady-state Cmax for nepafenac and for amfenac were 0.310 ± 0.104 ng/ml and 
0.422 ± 0.121 ng/ml, respectively, following ocular administration.
                        Nepafenac at concentrations up to 300 ng/mL did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of 6 specific marker substrates of 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and 
CYP3A4). Therefore, drug-drug interactions involving CYP mediated metabolism of 
concomitantly administered drugs are unlikely. Drug-drug interactions mediated 
by protein binding are also unlikely.
