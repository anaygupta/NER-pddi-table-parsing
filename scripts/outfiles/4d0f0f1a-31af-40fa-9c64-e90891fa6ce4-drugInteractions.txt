                        Mitoxantrone and its metabolites are excreted in bile and urine, but it is not known whether the metabolic or excretory pathways are saturable, may be inhibited or induced, or if mitoxantrone and its metabolites undergo enterohepatic circulation. To date, postmarketing experience has not revealed any significant drug interactions in patients who have received mitoxantrone injection for treatment of cancer. Information on drug interactions in patients with multiple sclerosis is limited. 
                        Following concurrent administration of mitoxantrone injection with corticosteroids, no evidence of drug interactions has been observed.
