                  Xenon Xe 133 is a readily diffusible gas which is neither utilized nor produced by the body. It passes through cell membranes and freely exchanges between blood and tissue. It tends to concentrate more in body fat than in blood, plasma, water or protein solutions. In the concentrations used for diagnostic purposes it is physiologically inactive. Inhaled Xenon Xe 133 Gas will enter the alveolar wall and enter the pulmonary venous circulation via the capillaries. Most of the Xenon Xe 133 that enters the circulation from a single breath is returned to the lungs and exhaled after a single pass through the peripheral circulation.
