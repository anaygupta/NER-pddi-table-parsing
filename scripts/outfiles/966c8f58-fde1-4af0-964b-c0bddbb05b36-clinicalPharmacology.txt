                  PharmacokineticsFollowing oral administration of a single 500 mg dose (two 250 mg 
tablets) to 36 fasted healthy male volunteers, the mean (SD) pharmacokinetic 
parameters were AUC0–72  =  4.3 (1.2) µg∙h/mL; Cmax = 0.5 (0.2) µg/mL; Tmax = 2.2 (0.9) 
hours. 
                  With a regimen of 500 mg (two 250 mg capsules1) on day 1, followed by 250 mg daily (one 250 mg 
capsule) on days 2 through 5, the pharmacokinetic parameters of azithromycin in 
plasma in healthy young adults (18–40 years of age) are portrayed in the chart 
below. Cmin and Cmax remained 
essentially unchanged from day 2 through day 5 of therapy.
                  


                  


In a two-way crossover study, 12 adult healthy volunteers (6 males, 6 
females) received 1,500 mg of azithromycin administered in single daily doses 
over either 5 days (two 250 mg tablets on day 1, followed by one 250 mg tablet 
on days 2–5) or 3 days (500 mg per day for days 1–3). Due to limited serum 
samples on day 2 (3-day regimen) and days 2–4 (5-day regimen), the serum 
concentration-time profile of each subject was fit to a 3-compartment model and 
the AUC0–
                     ∞ for the fitted 
concentration profile was comparable between the 5-day and 3-day regimens.
                  

*     Total AUC for the entire 3-day and 5-day regimens




                  

                  Median azithromycin exposure (AUC0–288) in mononuclear 
(MN) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes following either the 5-day or 3-day 
regimen was more than a 1000-fold and 800-fold greater than in serum, 
respectively. Administration of the same total dose with either the 5-day or 
3-day regimen may be expected to provide comparable concentrations of 
azithromycin within MN and PMN leukocytes.
                  Two azithromycin 250 mg tablets are bioequivalent to a single 500 mg 
tablet.
                  1Azithromycin 250 mg tablets are bioequivalent to 250 mg capsules in the 
fasted state.
Azithromycin 250 mg capsules are no longer commercially 
available. 
                  AbsorptionThe absolute bioavailability of azithromycin 250 mg capsules is 
38%.
                  In a two-way crossover study in which 12 healthy subjects received a single 
500 mg dose of azithromycin (two 250 mg tablets) with or without a high fat 
meal, food was shown to increase Cmax by 23% but had no 
effect on AUC.
                  When azithromycin suspension was administered with food to 28 adult healthy 
male subjects, Cmax increased by 56% and AUC was 
unchanged.
                  The AUC of azithromycin was unaffected by co-administration of an antacid 
containing aluminum and magnesium hydroxide with azithromycin capsules; however, 
the Cmax was reduced by 24%. Administration of cimetidine 
(800 mg) two hours prior to azithromycin had no effect on azithromycin 
absorption.
                  
                  
                  
                  DistributionThe serum protein binding of azithromycin is variable in the 
concentration range approximating human exposure, decreasing from 51% at 0.02 
µg/mL to 7% at 2 µg/mL.
                  Following oral administration, azithromycin is widely distributed throughout 
the body with an apparent steady-state volume of distribution of 31.1 L/kg. 
Greater azithromycin concentrations in tissues than in plasma or serum were 
observed. High tissue concentrations should not be interpreted to be 
quantitatively related to clinical efficacy. The antimicrobial activity of 
azithromycin is pH related and appears to be reduced with decreasing pH. 
However, the extensive distribution of drug to tissues may be relevant to 
clinical activity.
                  Selected tissue (or fluid) concentration and tissue (or fluid) to 
plasma/serum concentration ratios are shown in the following table:
                  

*  Azithromycin tissue concentrations were originally determined using 250 mg 
capsules. 



†  Sample was obtained 2–4 hours after the first dose.
‡  Sample was obtained 10–12 hours after the first dose.
§  
Dosing regimen of two doses of 250 mg each, separated by 12 hours. ¶  
Sample was obtained 19 hours after a single 500 mg dose. 

                  The extensive tissue distribution was confirmed by examination of additional 
tissues and fluids (bone, ejaculum, prostate, ovary, uterus, salpinx, stomach, 
liver, and gallbladder). As there are no data from adequate and well-controlled 
studies of azithromycin treatment of infections in these additional body sites, 
the clinical importance of these tissue concentration data is unknown.
                  Following a regimen of 500 mg on the first day and 250 mg daily for 4 days, 
only very low concentrations were noted in cerebrospinal fluid (less than 0.01 
µg/mL) in the presence of non-inflamed meninges.
                  
                  Metabolism
                     In vitro and in 
vivo studies to assess the metabolism of azithromycin have not been 
performed.
                  
                  EliminationPlasma concentrations of azithromycin following single 500 mg 
oral and i.v. doses declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma 
clearance of 630 mL/min and terminal elimination half-life of 68 hours. The 
prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and 
subsequent release of drug from tissues.
                  Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly as unchanged drug, is a 
major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the 
administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.
                  
                  
                  Special Populations
                  
                  Renal InsufficiencyAzithromycin pharmacokinetics were investigated in 42 adults (21 
to 85 years of age) with varying degrees of renal impairment. Following the oral 
administration of a single 1,000 mg dose of azithromycin, mean Cmax and AUC0–120 increased by 5.1% and 
4.2%, respectively in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR 10 to 
80 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (GFR greater than 80 mL/min). 
The mean Cmax and AUC0–120 
increased 61% and 35%, respectively in subjects with severe renal 
impairment (GFR less than 10 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function 
(GFR greater than 80 mL/min). (See 
                        DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION.)
                  
                  
                  Hepatic InsufficiencyThe pharmacokinetics of azithromycin in subjects with hepatic 
impairment have not been established.
                  
                  GenderThere are no significant differences in the disposition of 
azithromycin between male and female subjects. No dosage adjustment is 
recommended based on gender.
                  
                  Geriatric PatientsWhen studied in healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 85 years, the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of azithromycin in elderly men were similar to those 
in young adults; however, in elderly women, although higher peak concentrations 
(increased by 30 to 50%) were observed, no significant accumulation 
occurred.
                  
                  Pediatric PatientsIn two clinical studies, azithromycin for oral suspension was 
dosed at 10 mg/kg on day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg on days 2 through 5 to two 
groups of pediatric patients (aged 1–5 years and 5–15 years, respectively). The 
mean pharmacokinetic parameters on day 5 were Cmax=0.216 
µg/mL, Tmax=1.9 hours, and AUC0–24=1.822 µg∙hr/mL for the 1- to 5-year-old group and were 
Cmax=0.383 µg/mL, Tmax=2.4 hours, 
and AUC0–24=3.109 µg∙hr/mL for the 5- to 15-year-old 
group.
                  Two clinical studies were conducted in 68 pediatric patients aged 3–16 years 
to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of azithromycin for oral 
suspension. Azithromycin was administered following a low-fat breakfast.
                  The first study consisted of 35 pediatric patients treated with 20 mg/kg/day 
(maximum daily dose 500 mg) for 3 days of whom 34 patients were evaluated for 
pharmacokinetics. 
                  In the second study, 33 pediatric patients received doses of 12 mg/kg/day 
(maximum daily dose 500 mg) for 5 days of whom 31 patients were evaluated for 
pharmacokinetics.
                  In both studies, azithromycin concentrations were determined over a 24 hour 
period following the last daily dose. Patients weighing above 25.0 kg in the 
3-day study or 41.7 kg in the 5-day study received the maximum adult daily dose 
of 500 mg. Eleven patients (weighing 25.0 kg or less) in the first study and 17 
patients (weighing 41.7 kg or less) in the second study received a total dose of 
60 mg/kg. The following table shows pharmacokinetic data in the subset of 
pediatric patients who received a total dose of 60 mg/kg.
                  


                  




                  The similarity of the overall exposure (AUC0–
                     ∞) between the 3-day and 5-day regimens in pediatric patients 
is unknown.
                  Single dose pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients given doses of 30 mg/kg 
have not been studied. (See 
                        DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION.)
