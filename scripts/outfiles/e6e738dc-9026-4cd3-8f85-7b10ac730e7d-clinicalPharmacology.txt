                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Ofatumumab binds specifically to both the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 molecule. The CD20 molecule is expressed on normal B lymphocytes (pre–B- to mature B-lymphocyte) and on B-cell CLL. The CD20 molecule is not shed from the cell surface and is not internalized following antibody binding.
                        The Fab domain of ofatumumab binds to the CD20 molecule and the Fc domain mediates immune effector functions to result in B-cell lysis in vitro. Data suggest that possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        
                           B-Cell Depletion: In patients with previously untreated CLL, at 6 months after the last dose, the median reductions in CD19‑positive B cells were >99% (n = 155) for ARZERRA in combination with chlorambucil and 94% (n = 121) for chlorambucil alone.
                        In patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab, the median decrease in circulating CD19‑positive B cells was 91% (n = 50) with the 8th infusion and 85% (n = 32) with the 12th infusion. The time to recovery of lymphocytes, including CD19‑positive B cells, to normal levels has not been determined.
                        Although the depletion of B-cells in the peripheral blood is a measurable pharmacodynamic effect, it is not directly correlated with the depletion of B cells in solid organs or in malignant deposits. B-cell depletion has not been shown to be directly correlated to clinical response.
                        
                           Cardiac Electrophysiology: The effect of multiple doses of ARZERRA on the QTc interval was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 3 open-label studies in patients with CLL (N = 85). Patients received ARZERRA 300 mg on Day 1 followed by either 1,000 mg or 2,000 mg for subsequent doses. No large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e., >20 milliseconds) were detected in the pooled analysis.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Ofatumumab is eliminated through both a target‑independent route and a B cell‑mediated route. Ofatumumab exhibited dose‑dependent clearance in the dose range of 100 to 2,000 mg. Due to the depletion of B cells, the clearance of ofatumumab decreased substantially after subsequent infusions compared with the first infusion.
                        Pharmacokinetic data were obtained after repeated administration (4, 5, 8, or 12 infusions) of 1,000 mg or 2,000 mg doses in 381 patients with CLL (Studies 1, 2, and 3). The geometric mean (%CV) values for clearance, volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), and half-life for ofatumumab in these patients were 12.9 mL/hour (76%), 5.7 L (65%), and 15.6 days (90%). The pharmacokinetic profile was similar across doses in patients with CLL.
                        
                           Specific Populations:
                           Effects of Body Size, Gender, Age, and Renal Impairment: Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, body size, gender, age, and renal impairment (evaluated in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min) do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab.
