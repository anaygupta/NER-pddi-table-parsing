REVEX has
                                    been administered after benzodiazepines, inhalational
                                    anesthetics, muscle relaxants, and muscle relaxant antagonists
                                    administered in conjunction with general anesthesia. It also has
                                    been administered in outpatient settings, both in trials in
                                    conscious sedation and in the emergency management of overdose
                                    following a wide variety of agents. No deleterious interactions
                                    have been observed.Preclinical
                                    studies have shown that both flumazenil and nalmefene can induce
                                    seizures in animals. The coadministration of both flumazenil and
                                    nalmefene produced fewer seizures than expected in a study in
                                    rodents, based on the expected effects of each drug alone. Based
                                    on these data, an adverse interaction from the coadministration                                    of the two drugs is not expected, but physicians should remain
                                    aware of the potential risk of seizures from agents in these
                                    classes.
