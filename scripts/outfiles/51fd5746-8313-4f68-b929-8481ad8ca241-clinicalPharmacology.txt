                  After topical application to the skin of normal subjects, systemic absorption of econazole nitrate is extremely low.  Although most of the applied drug remains on the skin surface, drug concentrations were found in the stratum corneum which, by far, exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration for dermatophytes.  Inhibitory concentrations were achieved in the epidermis and as deep as the middle region of the dermis.  Less than 1% of the applied dose was recovered in the urine and feces.
