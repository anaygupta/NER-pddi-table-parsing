                  The urease enzyme is not present in mammalian cells, so the presence
of urease in the stomach is evidence that bacteria are present. The
presence of urease is not specific for H.pylori, but other bacteria are not
usually found in the stomach. The principle of the breath test is shown
in Figure 1.

                  To detect H.pylori, urea labeled with 14C is swallowed by the patient.
If gastric urease from H.pylori is present, urea is split to form CO2 and
NH3 at the interface between the gastric epithelium and lumen and
14CO2 is absorbed into the blood and exhaled in the breath.
                  Following ingestion of the capsule by a patient with H.pylori, 14CO2
excretion in the breath peaks between 10 and 15 minutes and declines
thereafter with a biological half-life of about 15 minutes. 14C-urea that
is not hydrolyzed by H.pylori is excreted in the urine with a half-life of
approximately 12 hours. About 10% of the 14C remains in the body at
72 hours and is gradually excreted with a biological half-life of 40 days.
