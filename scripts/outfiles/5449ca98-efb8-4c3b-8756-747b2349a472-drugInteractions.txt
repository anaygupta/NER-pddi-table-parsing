                  Formal PK drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed with PRIALT. As ziconotide is a peptide, it is expected to be completely degraded by endopeptidases and exopeptidases (Phase I hydrolytic enzymes) widely located throughout the body, and not by other Phase I biotransformation processes (including the cytochrome P450 system) or by Phase II conjugation reactions. Thus, intrathecal administration, low plasma ziconotide concentrations, and metabolism by ubiquitous peptidases make metabolic interactions of other drugs with ziconotide unlikely. Further, as ziconotide is not highly bound in plasma (approximately 50%) and has low plasma exposure following intrathecal administration, clinically relevant plasma protein displacement reactions involving ziconotide and co-administered medications are unlikely.
                  Over 90% of patients treated with intrathecal PRIALT used systemic opiates and in the slow titration study, 98% of patients received opioids.
                  The combination of PRIALT with intrathecal opiates has not been studied in placebo-controlled clinical trials and is not recommended.

                     7.1 Interaction with CNS Depressants
                     
                        Almost all patients in the PRIALT clinical trials received concomitant non-intrathecal medication. Most patients received several concomitant drugs, including antidepressants (66%), anxiolytics (52%), antiepileptics (47%), neuroleptics (46%), and sedatives (34%). The use of drugs with CNS-depressant activities may be associated with an increased incidence of CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness and confusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].
