                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Cysteamine acts as a cystine-depleting agent by converting cystine to cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfides and reduces corneal cystine crystal accumulation.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The peak plasma concentration of cysteamine following ocular administration of cysteamine ophthalmic solution in humans is unknown, but it is expected to be substantially less than the peak plasma concentration following oral administration of cysteamine bitartrate.
