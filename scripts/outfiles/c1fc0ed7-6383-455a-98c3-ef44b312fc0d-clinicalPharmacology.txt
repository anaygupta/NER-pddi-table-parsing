                  Topically applied urea dissolves the intercellular matrix of the skin which results in enhanced shedding of scaly, dry skin and thus a softening of the hyperkeratotic areas of the skin.
                  Urea topically applied to the nail plate has a similar effect on the intercellular matrix of the nail plate.
