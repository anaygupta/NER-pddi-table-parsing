                     7.1 Agents That May Exaggerate Pressor Responses

                     
                        Concomitant use of phenylephrine and atropine may enhance the pressor effects and induce tachycardia in some patients. Phenylephrine may potentiate the cardiovascular depressant effects of some inhalation anesthetic agents.
