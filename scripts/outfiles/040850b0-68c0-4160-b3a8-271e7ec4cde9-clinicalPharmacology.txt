                  Acetic acid is antibacterial and antifungal and is effective against microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) that infect the ears of patients with acute diffuse external otitis. In vitro tests, minimum lethal-time was less than 0.25 minutes when bacteria and fungi isolated from patients with otitis externa were exposed to 2% acetic acid. Quantitative absorption of acetic acid 2% from external auditory canal is not known.
