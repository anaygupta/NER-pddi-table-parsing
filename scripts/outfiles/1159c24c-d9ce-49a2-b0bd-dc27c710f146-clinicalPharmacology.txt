                  Histamine acts as a potent vasodilator when released from mast cells during an allergic reaction.  It is largely responsible for the immediate skin test reaction of a sensitive patient when challenged with an offending allergen.
                  The effect of added Glycerin (50% v/v) to 1 mg/mL histamine base was studied by puncture testing using a bifurcated needle in twelve volunteer subjects.  The mean sum of cross-diameters of the wheals was 13.25 mm (range 10-15 mm) for the non-glycerinated, and 12.54 mm (range 9-15 mm) for the glycerinated formulation.  Sum of cross-diameters of erythema was 52.88 mm (range 23-92 mm) for the non-glycerinated, and 54.42 mm (range 19-87 mm) for the glycerinated formulation.  These differences are not statistically significant.
