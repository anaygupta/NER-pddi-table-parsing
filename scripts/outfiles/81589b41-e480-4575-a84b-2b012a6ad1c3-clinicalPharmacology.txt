                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The pancreatic enzymes in PANCRELIPASE catalyze the hydrolysis of fats to monoglycerides, glycerol and fatty acids, protein into peptides and amino acids, and starch into dextrins and short chain sugars in the duodenum and proximal small intestine, thereby acting like digestive enzymes physiologically secreted by the pancreas.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pancreatic enzymes in PANCRELIPASE are enteric-coated to minimize destruction or inactivation in gastric acid.Â PANCRELIPASE is designed to release most of the enzymes in vivo at pH greater than 5.5. Pancreatic enzymes are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in any appreciable amount.
