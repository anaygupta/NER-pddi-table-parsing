                  Although it is generally agreed that
CeeNU alkylates DNA and RNA, it is not cross resistant with other alkylators.
As with other nitrosoureas, it may also inhibit several key enzymatic processes
by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins.
                  CeeNU
may be given orally. Following oral administration of radioactive CeeNU at
doses ranging from 30 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2,
about half of the radioactivity given was excreted in the urine in the form
of degradation products within 24 hours.
                  The serum
half-life of the metabolites ranges from 16 hours to 2 days. Tissue levels
are comparable to plasma levels at 15 minutes after intravenous administration.
                  Because
of the high lipid solubility and the relative lack of ionization at physiological
pH, CeeNU crosses the blood-brain barrier quite effectively. Levels of radioactivity
in the CSF are 50% or greater than those measured concurrently in plasma.
