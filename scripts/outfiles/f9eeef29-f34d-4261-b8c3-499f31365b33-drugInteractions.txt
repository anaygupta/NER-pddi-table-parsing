                              Cholestyramine: Use with raloxifene is not recommended. Reduces the absorption and enterohepatic cycling of raloxifene. (7.1, 12.3)

                           
                              Warfarin: Monitor prothrombin time when starting or stopping raloxifene. (7.2, 12.3)

                           
                              Highly Protein-Bound Drugs: Use with raloxifene with caution. Highly protein-bound drugs include diazepam, diazoxide, and lidocaine. 
                        
                        Raloxifene is more than 95% bound to plasma proteins. (7.3, 12.3)

                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Cholestyramine
                     
                        Concomitant administration of cholestyramine with raloxifene is not recommended. Although not specifically studied, it is anticipated that other anion exchange resins would have a similar effect. Raloxifene should not be coÂ­administered with other anion exchange resins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Warfarin
                     
                        If raloxifene is given concomitantly with warfarin or other warfarin derivatives, prothrombin time should be monitored more closely when starting or stopping therapy with raloxifene [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Other Highly Protein-Bound Drugs
                     
                        Raloxifene should be used with caution with certain other highly protein-bound drugs such as diazepam, diazoxide, and lidocaine. Although not examined, raloxifene might affect the protein binding of other drugs. Raloxifene is more than 95% bound to plasma proteins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Systemic Estrogens
                     
                        The safety of concomitant use of raloxifene with systemic estrogens has not been established and its use is not recommended. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Other Concomitant Medications
                     
                        Raloxifene can be concomitantly administered with ampicillin, amoxicillin, antacids, corticosteroids, and digoxin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
                        The concomitant use of raloxifene and lipid-lowering agents has not been studied.
