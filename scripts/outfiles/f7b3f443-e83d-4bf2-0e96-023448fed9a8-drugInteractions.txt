                     7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors
                     
                        Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see

                     7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers
                     
                        Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see 
                           
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)

                     7.3 Aspirin
                     
                        Use of BRILINTA with aspirin maintenance doses above 100 mg reduced the effectiveness of BRILINTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and

                     7.4 Simvastatin, Lovastatin
                     
                        BRILINTA increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           ].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Digoxin
                     
                        BRILINTA inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in BRILINTA therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           ].
