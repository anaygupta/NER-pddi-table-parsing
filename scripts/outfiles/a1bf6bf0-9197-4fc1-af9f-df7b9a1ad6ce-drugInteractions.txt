                        Warfarin: Miconazole may enhance anticoagulant effect. Monitor prothrombin time, INR, and watch for bleeding ( 7.1).
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Warfarin
                     
                        Concomitant administration of miconazole and warfarin has resulted in enhancement of anticoagulant effect. Cases of bleeding and bruising following the concomitant use of warfarin and topical, intravaginal, or oral miconazole were reported. Closely monitor prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests if ORAVIG is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Also monitor for evidence of bleeding.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Drugs Metabolized Through CYP2C9 and 3A4
                     
                        No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with ORAVIG. Miconazole is a known inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Although the systemic absorption of miconazole following ORAVIG administration is minimal and plasma concentrations of miconazole are substantially lower than when given intravenously, the potential for interaction with drugs metabolized through CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 such as oral hypoglycemics, phenytoin, or ergot alkaloids cannot be ruled out.
