                        When probenecid is used to elevate plasma concentrations of penicillin or other betalactams, or when such drugs are given to patients taking probenecid therapeutically, high plasma concentrations of the other drug may increase the incidence of adverse reactions associated with that drug. In the case of penicillin or other beta-lactams, psychic disturbances have been reported.
                        The use of salicylates antagonizes the uricosuric action of probenecid (see 
                              WARNINGS
                           ). The uricosuric action of probenecid is also antagonized by pyrazinamide.
                        Probenecid produces an insignificant increase in free sulfonamide plasma concentrations but a significant increase in total sulfonamide plasma levels. Since probenecid decreases the renal excretion of conjugated sulfonamides, plasma concentrations of the latter should be determined from time to time when a sulfonamide and probenecid are coadministered for prolonged periods. Probenecid may prolong or enhance the action of oral sulfonylureas and thereby increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
                        It has been reported that patients receiving probenecid require significantly less thiopental for induction of anesthesia. In addition, ketamine and thiopental anesthesia were significantly prolonged in rats receiving probenecid.
                        The concomitant administration of probenecid increases the mean plasma elimination half-life of a number of drugs which can lead to increased plasma concentrations. These include agents such as indomethacin, acetaminophen, naproxen, ketoprofen, meclofenamate, lorazepam, and rifampin. Although the clinical significance of this observation has not been established, a lower dosage of the drug may be required to produce a therapeutic effect, and increases in dosage of the drug in question should be made cautiously and in small increments when probenecid is being co-administered. Although specific instances of toxicity due to this potential interaction have not been observed to date, physicians should be alert to this possibility.
                        Probenecid given concomitantly with sulindac had only a slight effect on plasma sulfide levels, while plasma levels of sulindac and sulfone were increased. Sulindac was shown to produce a modest reduction in the uricosuric action of probenecid, which probably is not significant under most circumstances.
                        In animals and in humans, probenecid has been reported to increase plasma concentrations of methotrexate (see 
                              WARNINGS
                           ).
                        Falsely high readings for theophylline have been reported in an in vitro study, using the Schack and Waxler technic, when therapeutic concentrations of theophylline and probenecid were added to human plasma.
