Caution should be exercised when the following drugs are administered concomitantly with PARCOPA®  (carbidopa-levodopa orally disintegrating tablets).Caution should be exercised when the following drugs are administered concomitantly with PARCOPASymptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when carbidopa-levodopa was added to the treatment of a patient receiving antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, when therapy with PARCOPA®  is started, dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive drug may be required.®  is started, dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive drug may be required.For patients receiving MAO inhibitors (Type A or B), see Contraindications. Concomitant therapy with selegiline and carbidopa-levodopa may be associated with severe orthostatic hypotension not attributable to carbidopa-levodopa alone (see Contraindications).Contraindications. Concomitant therapy with selegiline and carbidopa-levodopa may be associated with severe orthostatic hypotension not attributable to carbidopa-levodopa alone (see There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and carbidopa-levodopa.Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson’s disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these drugs with PARCOPA®  should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response.2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson’s disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these drugs with PARCOPAIron salts may reduce the bioavailability of levodopa and carbidopa. The clinical relevance is unclear.Although metoclopramide may increase the bioavailability of levodopa by increasing gastric emptying, metoclopramide may also adversely affect disease control by its dopamine receptor antagonistic properties.
