	Patients who are taking non-selective beta blockers may be more reactive to skin tests and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. Antihistamines can significantly inhibit the immediate skin test reactions. If long acting antihistamines have been taken recently, it is recommended that they should be stopped for the following minimum intervals before skin testing is performed: at least 1 month for astemizole; 1 week for hydroxyzine or cetirizine; 4 to 7 days for Ioratadine; 3 to 4 days for terfenadine or fexofenadine; and 24 to 48 hours for other sustained release antihistamines.
