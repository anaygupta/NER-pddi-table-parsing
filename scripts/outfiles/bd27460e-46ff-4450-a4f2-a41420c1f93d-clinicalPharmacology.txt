                  PharmacodynamicsDiclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and 
antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of diclofenac 
sodium delayed-release tablets, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely 
understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.
                  
                  Pharmacokinetics
                  AbsorptionDiclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to 
IV administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass 
metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available (see 
Table 1). Food has no significant effect on the extent of diclofenac absorption. 
However, there is usually a delay in the onset of absorption of 1 to 4.5 hours 
and a reduction in peak plasma levels of <20%.
                  

                  
                  


                  



                  DistributionThe apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac sodium is 
1.4 L/kg.
                  Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to 
albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range 
(0.15-105 µg/mL) achieved with recommended doses.
                  Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the 
joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, 
after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than 
plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in 
the effectiveness of diclofenac.
                  
                  MetabolismFive diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma 
and urine. The metabolites include 4’-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3’-hydroxy-, 
4’,5-dihydroxy- and 3’-hydroxy-4’-methoxy diclofenac. In patients with renal 
dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4’-hydroxy- and 
5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after 
single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects. However, 
diclofenac metabolites undergo further glucuronidation and sulfation followed by 
biliary excretion.
                  One diclofenac metabolite 4’-hydroxy-diclofenac has very weak pharmacologic 
activity.
                  
                  ExcretionDiclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent 
urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of 
the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the 
urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 
35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Because 
renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged 
diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal 
dysfunction is not necessary. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is 
approximately 2 hours.
                  
                  Special Populations
                  PediatricThe pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets 
has not been investigated in pediatric patients.
                  
                  RacePharmacokinetics differences due to race have not been 
identified.
                  
                  Hepatic InsufficiencyHepatic metabolism accounts for almost 100% of diclofenac sodium 
delayed-release tablets elimination, so patients with hepatic disease may 
require reduced doses of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets compared to 
patients with normal hepatic function.
                  
                  Renal InsufficiencyDiclofenac pharmacokinetics has been investigated in subjects 
with renal insufficiency. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac 
have been detected in studies of patients with renal impairment. In patients 
with renal impairment (inulin clearance 60-90, 30-60, and <30 mL/min; N=6 in 
each group), AUC values and elimination rate were comparable to those in healthy 
subjects.
