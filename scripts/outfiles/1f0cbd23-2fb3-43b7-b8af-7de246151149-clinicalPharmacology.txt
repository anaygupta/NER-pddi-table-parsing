                  When injected intravenously, Technetium Tc 99m Pyrophosphate Injection has a specific affinity for areas of osteogenesis. It is also concentrated in the injured myocardium, primarily in areas of irreversibly damaged myocardial cells.
                  One to two hours after intravenous injection of Technetium Tc 99m Pyrophosphate Injection, an estimated 40 to 50 percent of the injected dose has been taken up by the skeleton, and approximately 0.01 to 0.02 percent per gram of acutely infarcted myocardium. Within a period of one hour, 10 to 11 percent remains in the vascular system, declining to approximately 2 to 3 percent twenty-four hours post injection. 
                  
                     
The average urinary excretion was observed to be about 40 percent of the administered dose after 24 hours.
                  
                     The non-radioactive reconstituted Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99m Pyrophosphate Injection also has an affinity for red blood cells. When administered 30 minutes prior to the intravenous administration of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection, approximately 76 percent of the injected activity remains in the blood pool providing excellent images of the cardiac chambers.
