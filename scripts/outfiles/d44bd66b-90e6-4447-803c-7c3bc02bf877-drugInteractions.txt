                                 The apparent clearance of lamotrigine is affected by the co-administration of certain medications. Because lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation, drugs that induce or inhibit glucuronidation may affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. 
                              Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone have been shown to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (see 
                                    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                                  and

                                 ). Most clinical experience is derived from patients taking these AEDs. 
                              Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and rifampin have also been shown to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (see
                                     PRECAUTIONS

                                 ). 
                              
                                 Valproate decreases the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (i.e., more than doubles the elimination half-life of lamotrigine),
                                 whether given with or without carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone. Accordingly, if lamotrigine is to be administered to a patient receiving valproate, lamotrigine must be given at a reduced dosage, no more than half the dose used in patients not receiving valproate, even in the presence of drugs that increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (see 
                                    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                                 and

                                 ).
                              The following drugs were shown not to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine: felbamate, gabapentin, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, and topiramate. Zonisamide does not appear to change the pharmacokinetic profile of lamotrigine (see 
                                    PRECAUTIONS

                                 ). 
                              
                                 In vitro inhibition experiments indicated that the formation of the primary metabolite of lamotrigine, the 2-N-glucuronide, was not significantly affected by co-incubation with clozapine, fluoxetine, phenelzine, risperidone, sertraline, or trazodone, and was minimally affected by co-incubation with amitriptyline, bupropion, clonazepam, haloperidol, or lorazepam. In addition, bufuralol metabolism data from human liver microsomes suggested that lamotrigine does not inhibit the metabolism of drugs eliminated predominantly by CYP2D6. 
                              Lamotrigine has no effects on the pharmacokinetics of lithium (see

                                 ). 
                              The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine were not changed by co-administration of bupropion (see 
                                    PRECAUTIONS

                              Co-administration of olanzapine did not have a clinically relevant effect on lamotrigine pharmacokinetics (see
