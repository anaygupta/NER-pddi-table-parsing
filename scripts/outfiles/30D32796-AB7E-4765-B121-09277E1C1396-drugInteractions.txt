Drug-Drug Interactions
Opioid analgesics, including oxycodone hydrochloride
                                    extended-release tablets, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking
                                    action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased
                                    degree of respiratory depression.Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via
                                    cytochrome P450 2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a
                                    variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including
                                    amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants),
                                    such blockade has not yet been shown to be of clinical
                                    significance with this agent. Clinicians should be aware of this
                                    possible interaction, however.
