                        The metabolism of progesterone by human liver microsomes was inhibited by ketoconazole (IC50 < 01 Î¼M). Ketoconazole is a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 and these data suggest that ketoconazole or other known inhibitors of this enzyme may increase the bioavailability of progesterone. The clinical relevance of the in vitro findings is unknown.
