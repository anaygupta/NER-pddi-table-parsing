                        Oxyphenbutazone:  Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.
                        Insulin:  In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and, therefore, insulin requirements.
                        Propranolol:  In a published pharmacokinetic study of an injectable testosterone product, administration of testosterone cypionate led to an increased clearance of propranolol in the majority of men tested. It is unknown if this would apply to TestimÂ®.
                        Corticosteroids:  The concurrent administration of testosterone with ACTH or corticosteroids may enhance edema formation; thus these drugs should be administered cautiously, particularly in patients with cardiac or hepatic disease.
