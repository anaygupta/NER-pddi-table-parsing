                        Patients receiving concomitant treatment of BOTOX and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like agents), or muscle relaxants, should be observed closely because the effect of BOTOX may be potentiated (7)

                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Aminoglycosides and Other Agents Interfering with Neuromuscular Transmission

                     
                        Co-administration of BOTOX and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs

                     
                        Use of anticholinergic drugs after administration of BOTOX may potentiate systemic anticholinergic effects.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Other Botulinum Neurotoxin Products

                     
                        The effect of administering different botulinum neurotoxin products at the same time or within several months of each other is unknown. Excessive neuromuscular weakness may be exacerbated by administration of another botulinum toxin prior to the resolution of the effects of a previously administered botulinum toxin.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Muscle Relaxants

                     
                        Excessive weakness may also be exaggerated by administration of a muscle relaxant before or after administration of BOTOX.
