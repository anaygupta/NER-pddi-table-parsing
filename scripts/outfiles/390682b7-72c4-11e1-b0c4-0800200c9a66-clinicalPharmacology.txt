                     12.1  Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Ocriplasmin has proteolytic activity against protein components of the vitreous body and the vitreoretinal interface (VRI) (e.g. laminin, fibronectin and collagen), thereby dissolving the protein matrix responsible for the vitreomacular adhesion (VMA).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3  Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The intravitreal pharmacokinetics of ocriplasmin were determined in a clinical study in patients scheduled for vitrectomy where 0.125 mg ocriplasmin (corresponding to an average concentration of 29 mcg ocriplasmin per mL vitreous volume [approximately 4.3 mL/eye]) was administered as a single intravitreal dose at different time points prior to vitrectomy. The mean ocriplasmin activity levels decreased with time from injection to time of sampling as illustrated in Table 1, according to a second order kinetic process. At 24 hours post injection the levels in the vitreous were below 3% of the theoretical concentration reached immediately after injection.
                        Because of the small dose administered (0.125 mg), detectable levels of ocriplasmin in systemic circulation are not expected after intravitreal injection.

Ocriplasmin enters the endogenous protein catabolism pathway through which it is rapidly inactivated via its interactions with protease inhibitor α2-antiplasmin or α2-macroglobulin.
