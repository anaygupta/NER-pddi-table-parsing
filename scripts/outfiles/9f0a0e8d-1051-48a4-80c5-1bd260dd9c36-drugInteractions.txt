                        Concomitant topical medications, medicated or abrasive soaps, shampoos, cleansers, cosmetic with a strong drying effect, products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime, permanent wave solutions, electrolysis, hair depilatories or waxes, and products that may irritate the skin should be used with caution in patients being treated with RENOVA® (tretinoin cream) 0.02% because they may increase irritation with RENOVA® (tretinoin cream) 0.02%.
                        RENOVA® (tretinoin cream) 0.02% should not be administered if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the possibility of augmented phototoxicity.
