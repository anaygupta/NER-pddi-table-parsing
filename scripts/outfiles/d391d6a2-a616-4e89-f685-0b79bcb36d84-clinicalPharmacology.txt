                  This irrigation solution exerts a mechanical cleansing action for sterile        irrigation of body cavities, tissues or wounds, indwelling urethral catheters and surgical        drainage tubes and for washing, rinsing or soaking surgical dressings, instruments and        laboratory specimens. It also serves as a diluent or vehicle for drugs used for irrigation or        other pharmaceutical preparations.
                  0.9% Sodium Chloride Irrigation, USP provides an isotonic saline irrigation        identical in composition with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline).
                  0.9% Sodium Chloride Irrigation, USP is considered generally compatible with living        tissues and organs.
                  Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and        chloride (Cl¯) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the        extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte        disturbances. Chloride (Cl¯) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen        and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of        sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl¯) are largely under the control of the        kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output.
                  Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for        approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirements ranges from        two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and        urine production).
                  Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water        distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments        and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.
