                     7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs
                     
                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and Naratriptan Tablets, USP within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Other 5-HT1 Agonists
                     
                        Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of treatment with Naratriptan Tablets, USP is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive.
