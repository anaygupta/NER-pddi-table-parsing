                     In vitro studies have shown that precipitation occurs when eye drops containing thimerosal are mixed with XALATAN. If such drugs are used, they should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart.
                  The combined use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including XALATAN is not recommended. It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin drug products more than once daily may decrease the IOP lowering effect or cause paradoxical elevations in IOP.
