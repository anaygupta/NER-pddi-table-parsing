                        As Adapalene Cream, 0.1% has the potential to produce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime rind) should be approached with caution.  Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid in combination with Adapalene Cream, 0.1%.  If these preparations have been used, it is advisable not to start therapy with Adapalene Cream, 0.1% until the effects of such preparations in the skin have subsided.
