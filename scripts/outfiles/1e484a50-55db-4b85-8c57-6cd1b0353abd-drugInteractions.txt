                        Strong CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin) reduce exposure to macitentan: avoid co-administration with OPSUMIT (7.1, 12.3).
                        Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase exposure to macitentan: avoid co-administration with OPSUMIT (7.2, 12.3).
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Strong CYP3A4 Inducers
                     
                        Strong inducers of CYP3A4 such as rifampin significantly reduce macitentan exposure. Concomitant use of OPSUMIT with strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                     
                        Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors like ketoconazole approximately double macitentan exposure. Many HIV drugs like ritonavir are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Avoid concomitant use of OPSUMIT with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use other PAH treatment options when strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are needed as part of HIV treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
