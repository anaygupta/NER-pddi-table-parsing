                     7.1 Use with Anticholinergics
                     
                        Galantamine has the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Use With Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors
                     
                        A synergistic effect is expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, other cholinesterase inhibitors, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
