                        Drug interactions common to other potent opioid analgesics also may occur with buprenorphine hydrochloride.  Particular care should be taken when buprenorphine hydrochloride is used in combination with central nervous system depressant drugs (see WARNINGS).  Although specific information is not presently available, caution should be exercised when buprenorphine hydrochloride is used in combination with MAO inhibitors.  There have been reports of respiratory and cardiovascular collapse in patients who received therapeutic doses of diazepam and buprenorphine hydrochloride.  A suspected interaction between buprenorphine hydrochloride and phenprocoumon resulting in purpura has been reported.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                           
                              Since the metabolism of buprenorphine is mediated by the CYP3A4 isozyme, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of buprenorphine. Thus patients coadministered with inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritanovir) while receiving buprenorphine hydrochloride should be carefully monitored and dosage adjustment made if warranted.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           CYP3A4 Inducers
                           
                              Cytochrome P450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, induce metabolism and as such may cause increased clearance of buprenorphine.  Caution is advised when administering buprenorphine hydrochloride to patients receiving these medications and if necessary dose adjustments should be considered.
