                  Mechanism of ActionFexofenadine hydrochloride, the major active metabolite of 
terfenadine, is an antihistamine with selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist activity. Both enantiomers of 
fexofenadine hydrochloride displayed approximately equipotent antihistaminic 
effects. Fexofenadine hydrochloride inhibited antigen-induced bronchospasm in 
sensitized guinea pigs and histamine release from peritoneal mast cells in rats. 
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. In laboratory animals, 
no anticholinergic or alpha1-adrenergic blocking effects 
were observed. Moreover, no sedative or other central nervous system effects 
were observed. Radiolabeled tissue distribution studies in rats indicated that 
fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier.
