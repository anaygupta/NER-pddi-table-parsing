Drug Interactions
Anticoagulants (oral): effects may be decreased when used concurrently with thiazide diuretics; dosage adjustments may be necessary.Antigout medications: thiazide diuretics may raise the level of blood uric acid; dosage adjustment of antigout medications may be necessary to control hyperuricemia and gout.Other antihypertensive medications, especially diazoxide; pre-anesthetic and anesthetic agents used in surgery; skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing, used in surgery: effects may be potentiated when used concurrently with thiazide diuretics; dosage adjustments may be necessary.Amphotericin B or Corticosteroids, including Corticotropin (ACTH): concurrent use with thiazide diuretics may intensify electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia. Cardiac glycosides: concurrent use with thiazide diuretics may enhance the possibility of digitalis toxicity associated with hypokalemia.Colestipol: may inhibit gastrointestinal absorption of the thiazide diuretics; administration 1 hour before or 4 hours after colestipol is recommended.Hypoglycemics: thiazide diuretics may raise blood glucose levels. For adult-onset diabetics, dosage adjustment of hypoglycemic medications may be necessary during and after thiazide diuretic therapy; insulin requirements may be increased, decreased, or unchanged.
