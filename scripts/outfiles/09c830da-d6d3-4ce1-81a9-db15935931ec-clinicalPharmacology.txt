                  Dihydrocodeine is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic/antitussive related to codeine, with multiple actions 
qualitatively similar to those of codeine: the most prominent of these involve the central nervous system 
and organs with smooth muscle components.
                  Phenylephrine hydrochloride affects its vasoconstrictor activity by releasing noradrenaline from sympathetic 
nerve endings, and from direct stimulation of Î±-adrenoreceptos in blood vessels.
                  Guaifenesin is an expectorant, which increases respiratory tract fluid secretions and helps to loosen phlegm 
and bronchial secretions. By reducing the viscosity of secretions, guaifenesin increases the efficiency of the 
cough reflex and of ciliary action in removing accumulated secretions from the trachea and bronchi.
