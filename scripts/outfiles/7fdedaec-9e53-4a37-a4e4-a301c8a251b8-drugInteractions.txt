                  This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions with RAPIVAB.  Drug-drug interaction studies are described elsewhere in the labeling [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), intranasal:  Avoid use of LAIV within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after administration of RAPIVAB, unless medically indicated (7.1)
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Influenza Vaccines
                     
                        Inactivated influenza vaccine can be administered at any time relative to use of RAPIVAB. For live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), antiviral drugs may inhibit viral replication and thus may reduce vaccine efficacy. The concurrent use of RAPIVAB with LAIV intranasal has not been evaluated. Because of the potential for interference between these two products, avoid use of LAIV within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after administration of RAPIVAB unless medically indicated.
