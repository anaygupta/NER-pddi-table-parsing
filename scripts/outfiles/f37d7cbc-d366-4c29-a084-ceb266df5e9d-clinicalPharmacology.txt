                  Like other topical corticosteroids, triamcinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The extent of absorption through the oral mucosa is determined by multiple factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the mucosal barrier, the duration of therapy, and the presence of inflammation and/or other disease processes. Once absorbed through the mucous membranes, the disposition of corticosteroids is similar to that of systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to the plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys; some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.
