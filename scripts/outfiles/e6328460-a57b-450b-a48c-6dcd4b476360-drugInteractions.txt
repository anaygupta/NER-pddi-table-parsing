                  There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between Renvela and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.  
                  


               



               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           When clinically significant drug interactions are expected, consider separation of the timing of administration and/or monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. (7)
                           Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol and warfarin. (7)
                           Sevelamer has demonstrated interaction with ciprofloxacin, mycophenolate mofetil, and therefore these drugs should be dosed separately from Renvela. (7)
