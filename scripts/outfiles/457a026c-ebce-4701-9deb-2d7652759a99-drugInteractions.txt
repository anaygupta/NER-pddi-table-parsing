                        The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of other vasodilators.
                        Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with phosphodiesterase inhibitors in any form is contraindicated (see 
                              Contraindications
                           ).
                        Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, is contraindicated (see 
                              Contraindications
                           ).
                        Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination.
                        Intravenous nitroglycerin interferes, at least in some patients, with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. In patients receiving intravenous nitroglycerin, concomitant heparin therapy should be guided by frequent measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time.
                        Administration of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection through the same infusion set as blood can result in pseudoagglutination and hemolysis. More generally, Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection should not be mixed with any other medication of any kind.
