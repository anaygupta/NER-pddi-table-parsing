                        Due to the hydralazine component of BiDil, monoamine-oxidase inhibitors should be used with caution in patients receiving BiDil.
                        Patients treated with BiDil who receive any potent parenteral antihypertensive agent should be continuously observed for several hours for excessive fall in blood pressure.
                        The effects of BiDil on vasodilators including alcohol may be additive.
