                           Do not use AXERT® and ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications within 24 hours of each other (4.5, 7.1)
                           Do not use AXERT® and other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other (4.6, 7.2)

                           Ketoconazole: use single dose of AXERT® 6.25 mg; maximum AXERT® daily dose 12.5 mg (7.4)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Ergot-Containing Drugs
                     
                        These drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because, in theory, vasospastic effects may be additive, ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine, ergotamine tartrate, or methysergide) and AXERT® (almotriptan malate) should not be used within 24 hours of each other [see Contraindications (4.5)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	5-HT1 Agonists (e.g., Triptans)
                     
                        Concomitant use of other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of treatment with AXERT® is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.6)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors
                     
                        Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4	Ketoconazole and Other Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                     
                        Co-administration of almotriptan and oral ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in an approximately 60% increase in exposure of almotriptan. Increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when almotriptan is used concomitantly with other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        In patients concomitantly using potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, the recommended starting dose of AXERT® is 6.25 mg. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 12.5 mg within a 24-hour period. Concomitant use of AXERT® and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
