                        12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                     
                        Endogenous pulmonary surfactant reduces surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveoli during ventilation and stabilizes the alveoli against collapse at resting transpulmonary pressures. A deficiency of pulmonary surfactant in preterm infants results in Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) characterized by poor lung expansion, inadequate gas exchange, and a gradual collapse of the lungs (atelectasis).
                        CUROSURF compensates for the deficiency of surfactant and restores surface activity to the lungs of these infants.

                           In vitro - CUROSURF lowers minimum surface tension to â‰¤ 4mN/m as measured by the Wilhelmy Balance System.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                     
                        CUROSURF is administered directly to the lung, where biophysical effects occur at the alveolar surface. No human pharmacokinetic studies have been performed to characterize the absorption, biotransformation, or elimination of CUROSURF.
