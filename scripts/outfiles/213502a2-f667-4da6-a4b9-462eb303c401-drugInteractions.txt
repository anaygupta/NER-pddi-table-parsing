                           In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Cimetidine
                     
                        Coadministration of amlodipine besylate tablets with cimetidine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Grapefruit Juice
                     
                        Coadministration of 240 mL of grapefruit juice with a single oral dose of amlodipine 10 mg in 20 healthy volunteers had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.

                        Coadministration of a magnesium and aluminum hydroxide antacid with a single dose of amlodipine besylate tablets had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Sildenafil
                     
                        A single 100 mg dose of sildenafil in subjects with essential hypertension had no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine. When amlodipine besylate tablets and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6 Atorvastatin
                     
                        Coadministration of multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine besylate tablets with 80 mg of atorvastatin resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.7 Digoxin
                     
                        Coadministration of amlodipine besylate tablets with digoxin did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance in normal volunteers.

                        Single and multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine besylate tablets had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of ethanol.

                        Coadministration of amlodipine besylate tablets with warfarin did not change the warfarin prothrombin response time.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.10 CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                     
                        Coadministration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin coadministration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent. Monitor for symptoms of hypotension and edema when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors.

                        No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be closely monitored when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inducers.
