                  Corticosteroids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing.  Since corticosteroids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, concomitant antimicrobial drugs may be used when the inhibition is considered to be clinically significant in a particular case.  When a decision to administer both a corticosteroid and antimicrobials is made, the administration of such drugs in combination has the advantage of greater patient compliance and convenience, with the added assurance that the appropriate dosage of all drugs is administered.  When each type of drug is in the same formulation, compatibility of ingredients is assured and the correct volume of drug is delivered and retained.  The relative potency of corticosteroids depends on the molecular structure, concentration, and release from the vehicle.
