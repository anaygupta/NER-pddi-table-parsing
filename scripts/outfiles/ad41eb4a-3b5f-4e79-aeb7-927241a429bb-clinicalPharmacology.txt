                  Liposyn III (intravenous fat emulsion) provides the patient requiring parenteral nutrition with a source of calories and the essential fatty acids normally obtained from a nutritionally complete oral diet. The supplemental polyunsaturated fat prevents biochemical changes of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) and prevents and reverses EFAD clinical manifestations (e.g., scaliness of skin, growth retardation, poor wound healing and sparse hair growth).
                  The infused fat particles are cleared from the bloodstream in a manner thought to be similar to the clearing of chylomicrons. Following infusion, there is a transient increase in plasma triglycerides. The triglycerides are hydrolyzed to free fatty acids and glycerol by the enzyme, lipoprotein lipase. The free fatty acids either enter the tissues (where they may be oxidized or resynthesized into triglycerides and stored) or circulate in the plasma, bound to albumin. In the liver, circulating free fatty acids are oxidized or converted to very low density lipoproteins that  re-enter the bloodstream.
                  Phosphatides are the hydrophobic components of membranes and provide electrically insulated layers. They are involved in the formation of membrane structures. Choline prevents the deposition of fat in the liver.
                  Glycerol is metabolized to carbon dioxide and glycogen or is used in the synthesis of body fats.
