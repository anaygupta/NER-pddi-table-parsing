                  Methylprednisolone is a potent anti-inflammatory steroid with greater anti-inflammatory potency than prednisolone and even less tendency than prednisolone to induce sodium and water retention.
                  Methylprednisolone sodium succinate has the same metabolic and anti-inflammatory actions as methylprednisolone.  When given parenterally and in equimolar quantities, the two compounds are equivalent in biologic activity.  The relative potency of methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone sodium succinate, as indicated by depression of eosinophil count, following intravenous administration, is at least four to one.  This is in good agreement with the relative oral potency of methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone.
