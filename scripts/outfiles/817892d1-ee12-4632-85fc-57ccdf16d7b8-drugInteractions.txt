                  While co-administration of Zavesca appeared to increase the clearance of imiglucerase by 70%, these results are not conclusive because of the small number of patients studied and because patients took variable doses of imiglucerase [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Co-administration of Zavesca and imiglucerase may lead to increased clearance of imiglucerase (7).
