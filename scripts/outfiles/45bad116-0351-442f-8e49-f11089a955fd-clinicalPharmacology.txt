                        Zithranol-RR contains anthralin, a synthetic compound whose precise mechanism of anti-psoriatic action is not yet fully understood.  However, numerous studies have demonstrated anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of anthralin on psoriatic and normal skin.  The anti-proliferative effects of anthralin appear to result from both an inhibition of DNA synthesis as well as from its strong reducing properties.  Recently, anthralin’s effectiveness as an anti-psoriatic agent has also been in part attributed to its abilities to induce lipid peroxidation and reduce levels of endothelial adhesion molecules which are markedly elevated in psoriatic patients.  Unlike retinoids and PUVA, anthralin does not inhibit liver microsomal enzyme activity; consequently, the likelihood of adverse drug interactions is greatly reduced when other agents are administered concomitantly with anthralin.
                        
Since Zithranol-RR’s proprietary microcrystalline delivery system rapidly releases anthralin into psoriatic plaques on contact with skin, Zithranol-RR is especially useful for short contact (5-15 minutes) therapy with anthralin.
