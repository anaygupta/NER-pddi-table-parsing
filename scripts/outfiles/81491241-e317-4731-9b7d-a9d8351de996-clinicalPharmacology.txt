                  studies have demonstrated tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including and (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some . , most strains and and some species. Bacterial susceptibility studies demonstrate that in some cases, microorganisms resistant to gentamicin retain susceptibility to tobramycin.
