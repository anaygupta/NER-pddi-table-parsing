                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Ferric carboxymaltose is a colloidal iron (III) hydroxide in complex with carboxymaltose, a carbohydrate polymer that releases iron.

                        Using positron emission tomography (PET) it was demonstrated that red cell uptake of 59Fe and 52Fe from Injectafer ranged from 61% to 99%. In patients with iron deficiency, red cell uptake of radio-labeled iron ranged from 91% to 99% at 24 days after Injectafer dose. In patients with renal anemia red cell uptake of radio-labeled iron ranged from 61% to 84% after 24 days Injectafer dose.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        After administration of a single dose of Injectafer of 100 to 1000 mg of iron in iron deficient patients, maximum iron levels of 37 µg/mL to 333 µg/mL were obtained respectively after 15 minutes to 1.21 hours post dose. The volume of distribution was estimated to be 3 L.
                        The iron injected or infused was rapidly cleared from the plasma, the terminal half-life ranged from 7 to 12 hours. Renal elimination of iron was negligible.
