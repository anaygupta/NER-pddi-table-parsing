                  Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the body and the
                            major fraction is in the bony structure. Calcium plays important
                            physiological roles, many of which are poorly understood. It is
                            essential for the functional integrity of the nervous and muscular
                            systems. It is necessary for normal cardiac function and is one of the
                            factors that operates in the mechanisms involved in the coagulation of
                            blood.
                  Calcium chloride in water dissociates to
                            provide calcium (Ca++) and chloride (ClÂ¯) ions. They are
                            normal constituents of the body fluids and are dependent on various
                            physiological mechanisms for maintenance of balance between intake and
                            output. Approximately 80% of body calcium is excreted in the feces
                            as insoluble salts; urinary excretion accounts for the remaining
                            20%.
