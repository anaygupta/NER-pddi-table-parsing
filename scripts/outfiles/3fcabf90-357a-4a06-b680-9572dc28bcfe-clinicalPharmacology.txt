                  The mood elevating mechanism of tricyclic antidepressants is at present unknown.  Nortriptyline hydrochloride oral solution is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.  It inhibits the activity of such diverse agents as histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and acetylcholine.  It increases the pressor effect of norepinephrine but blocks the pressor response of phenethylamine.  Studies suggest that nortriptyline hydrochloride oral solution interferes with the transport, release, and storage of catecholamines.  Operant conditioning techniques in rats and pigeons suggest that nortriptyline hydrochloride oral solution has a combination of stimulant and depressant properties.
