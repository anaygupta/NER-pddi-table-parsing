                  The absorption of oral medications may be decreased during the concurrent use of scopolamine because of
                  decreased gastric motility and delayed gastric emptying. [

                  Scopolamine should be used with caution in patients taking other drugs that are capable of causing CNS effects such
                  as sedatives, tranquilizers, or alcohol. Special attention should be paid to potential interactions with drugs having
                  anticholinergic properties; e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, antihistamines (including meclizine), tricyclic
                  antidepressants, and muscle relaxants.
                  In vitro studies indicated that the potential for scopolamine to alter the pharmacokinetics of other concomitant
                  medications through inhibition of CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 or induction of CYP 1A2 and 3A4 is
                  low; however, in vivo studies have not been conducted. [

                        Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test.
