                  No specific interaction studies have been conducted with 
Exelon Patch (rivastigmine transdermal system).
                  
                  
                  7.1 
                  Effect 
of Exelon on the Metabolism of Other Drugs
                  Rivastigmine is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by 
esterases. Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. 
Based on in-vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are 
expected: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, or CYP2C19.
                  No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine taken orally 
and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. 
The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by 
administration of rivastigmine.
                  
                  
                  7.2 
                  Effect 
of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Exelon
                  Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected 
to alter the metabolism of rivastigmine.
                  Population PK analysis with a database of 625 patients showed that the 
pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine taken orally were not influenced by commonly 
prescribed medications such as antacids (n=77), antihypertensives (n=72), 
ß-blockers (n=42), calcium channel blockers (n=75), antidiabetics (n=21), 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n=79), estrogens (n=70), salicylate 
analgesics (n=177), antianginals (n=35) and antihistamines (n=15).

                  In view of its pharmacodynamic effects, rivastigmine should not 
be given concomitantly with other cholinomimetic drugs and might interfere with 
the activity of anticholinergic medications. A synergistic effect may be 
expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with 
succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists 
such as bethanechol.
