              Dextrose, the natural sugar occurring in blood, is the principal source of energy for the body. In addition to its importance as the primary source of energy for the body, dextrose has a multitude of other essential roles in the body economy. It is readily converted to fat, which provides a rich store of energy in a concentrated form (9 cal/g). Dextrose is also stored within the liver and muscles as glycogen. When a rapid rise in blood sugar is demanded by the body, glycogen is quickly liberated as D-glucose. When the supply of dextrose is insufficient, the body mobilizes its fat stores, which are converted to acetate with production of energy by the same oxidative pathways employed in the combustion of the dextrose. 

                  
                  Another important use of dextrose in the total body economy is the sparing of proteins, which, in the absence of dextrose, may be deaminated to provide carbon moieties from their constituent amino acids. These deaminated fragments may undergo oxidation in order to release energy. Dextrose is also the probable source of glucuronic acid, with which many foreign substances and their metabolites combine to form excretion products. It probably provides the basic substances required for the formation of hyaluronates and chondroitin sulfates, the supporting structure of the organism. It can be converted to a pentose essential for the formation of nucleic acids by the cells.
