                  Aminosyn, Sulfite-Free, (a crystalline amino acid solution) provides crystalline amino acids to promote protein synthesis and wound healing, and to reduce the rate of endogenous protein catabolism. Aminosyn, given by central venous infusion in combination with concentrated dextrose, electrolytes, vitamins, trace metals, and ancillary fat supplements, constitutes total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Aminosyn can also be administered by peripheral vein with dextrose and maintenance electrolytes. Intravenous fat emulsion may be substituted for part of the carbohydrate calories during either TPN or peripheral vein administration of Aminosyn.
