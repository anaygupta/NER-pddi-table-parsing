                           Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure [see 
                           
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           
                           ].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
      7.2 Methadone
   
                     
                        
                           The addition of methadone has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir. In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased [see 
                           
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           
                           ]. This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients.
