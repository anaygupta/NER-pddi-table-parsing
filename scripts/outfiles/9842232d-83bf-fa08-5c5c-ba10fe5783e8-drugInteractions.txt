                     7.1  Ergot-containing Drugs
                     
                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see

                     7.2  MAO-A Inhibitors
                     
                        MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and

                     7.3  5-HT1B/1D agonists
                     
                        Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4)
                           ].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors
                     
                        Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see

                     7.5  Cimetidine
                     
                        Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           ]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see
