                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause
                                    prolonged vasospastic reactions. Due to a theoretical risk of a
                                    pharmacodynamic interaction, use of ergotamine-containing or
                                    ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide)
                                    and FROVA within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see
                                        CONTRAINDICATIONS).
                        Concomitant use of other 5HT1B/1D agonists
                                    within 24 hours of FROVA treatment is not recommended (see
                                        CONTRAINDICATIONS).

                                    serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of
                                    selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin
                                    norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and triptans. (See
