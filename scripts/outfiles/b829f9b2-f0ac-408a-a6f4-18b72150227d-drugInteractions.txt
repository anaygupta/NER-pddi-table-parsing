                  Significant drug interactions with lamotrigine are summarized in this section. Additional details of these drug interaction studies are provided in the Clinical Pharmacology section [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  


               



               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Valproate increases lamotrigine concentrations more than 2-fold. (7, 12.3)
                           Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, and rifampin decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 40%. (7, 12.3)
                           Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 50%. (7, 12.3)
                           Protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/lopinavir decrease lamotrigine exposure by approximately 50% and 32%, respectively. (7, 12.3)
                           Coadministration with organic cationic transporter 2 substrates with narrow therapeutic index is not recommended (7, 12.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           Effect of Lamotrigine on Organic Cationic Transporter 2 Substrates
                        
                        Lamotrigine is an inhibitor of renal tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter 2 (OCT2) proteins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs that are substantially excreted via this route. Coadministration of lamotrigine with OCT2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., dofetilide) is not recommended.
