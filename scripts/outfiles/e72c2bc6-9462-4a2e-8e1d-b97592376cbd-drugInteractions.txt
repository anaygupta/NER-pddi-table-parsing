                            Co-administration of VIRACEPT with other drugs (CYP3A substrates) can alter the concentration of these other drugs, and other drugs (inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP3A or CYP2C19) may alter the concentrations of nelfinavir. The potential drug-drug concentrations must be considered prior to and during therapy (4, 7, 12.3)
                            VIRACEPT should be given with food one hour after or more than 2 hours before didanosine (7)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Potential for VIRACEPT to Affect Other Drugs
                     
                        Nelfinavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A. Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A (e.g., dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, immunosuppressants and PDE5 inhibitors) may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs that could increase or prolong both its therapeutic and adverse effects. (see Tables 3 and 6).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect VIRACEPT
                     
                        Nelfinavir is metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2C19. Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs that induce CYP3A or CYP2C19, such as rifampin, may decrease nelfinavir plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs that inhibit CYP3A or CYP2C19 may increase nelfinavir plasma concentrations.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions
                     
                        Table 6 provides the effect on concentrations of VIRACEPT or concomitant drug as a result of coadministration with VIRACEPT. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy.
