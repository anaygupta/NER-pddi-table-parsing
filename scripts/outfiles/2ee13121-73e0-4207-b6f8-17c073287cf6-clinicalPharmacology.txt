                  Morphine, an opium alkaloid, is a narcotic analgesic and provides analgesia at a dose that does not produce severe alterations in consciousness. Its principal therapeutic effect is relief of pain. Its exact mechanism and locus of action are not known, but are believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. The drug affects both the initial perception of pain and the emotional response to it and although pain relief is not usually complete, the level of distress or suffering is markedly decreased. In addition to analgesia, narcotics produce drowsiness, changes in mood, and mental clouding; however, neither sensory modalities nor motor activity are blocked at therapeutic doses. There is no intrinsic limit to the analgesic effect, but high dosages can produce adverse effects such as respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, cough reflex depression, miosis, mild vasodilation and an increase in tone of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. The use of Morphine Sulfate Injection USP in the LifeCare PCA Infuser should not result in true patient addiction.
                  Pain relief generally begins within several minutes after I.V. injection. Higher doses provide greater analgesic effect and longer duration of action but adverse effects limit the maximum tolerated dose.
                  Morphine is detoxified in the liver by conjugation and glucuronic acid. Small amounts of the free drug and larger amounts of conjugated morphine are found in the urine. These account for most of the administered drug and 90% of the total excretion occurs within the first 24 hours.
