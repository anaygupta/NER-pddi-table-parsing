                              •Tamoxifen: Do not use in combination with anastrozole tablets. No additional benefit seen over tamoxifen monotherapy. (7.1, 14.1) 
                           
                              •Estrogen-containing products: Combination use may diminish activity of anastrozole tablets. (7.2) 
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Tamoxifen 
                     
                        Coadministration of anastrozole and tamoxifen in breast cancer patients reduced anastrozole plasma concentration by 27%. However, the coadministration of anastrozole and tamoxifen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen or N-desmethyltamoxifen. At a median follow-up of 33 months, the combination of anastrozole and tamoxifen did not demonstrate any efficacy benefit when compared with tamoxifen in all patients as well as in the hormone receptor-positive subpopulation. This treatment arm was discontinued from the trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Based on clinical and pharmacokinetic results from the ATAC trial, tamoxifen should not be administered with anastrozole. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Estrogen 
                     
                        Estrogen-containing therapies should not be used with anastrozole tablets as they may diminish its pharmacological action. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Warfarin 
                     
                        In a study conducted in 16 male volunteers, anastrozole did not alter the exposure (as measured by Cmax and AUC) and anticoagulant activity (as measured by prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin time) of both R- and S-warfarin. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Cytochrome P450 
                     
                        Based on in vitro and in vivo results, it is unlikely that coadministration of anastrozole tablets 1 mg will affect other drugs as a result of inhibition of cytochrome P450 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
