                  When administered alone, protamine has an anticoagulant effect.  However, when it is given in the presence of heparin (which is strongly acidic), a stable salt is formed and the anticoagulant activity of both drugs is lost.
                  Protamine sulfate has a rapid onset of action.  Neutralization of heparin occurs within five minutes after intravenous administration of an appropriate dose of protamine sulfate.  Although the metabolic fate of the heparin-protamine complex has not been elucidated, it has been postulated that protamine sulfate in the heparin-protamine complex may be partially metabolized or may be attacked by fibrinolysin, thus freeing heparin.
