                  Drug Interactions
                     Some studies have shown 
that simultaneous sucralfate administration in healthy volunteers reduced the 
extent of absorption (bioavailability) of single doses of the following: 
cimetidine, digoxin, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, ketoconazole, 1-thyroxine, 
phenytoin, quinidine, ranitidine, tetracycline, and theophylline. Subtherapeutic 
prothrombin times with concomitant warfarin and sucralfate therapy have been 
reported in spontaneous and published case reports. However, two clinical 
studies have demonstrated no change in either serum warfarin concentration or 
prothrombin time with the addition of sucralfate to chronic warfarin 
therapy.
                  
                     The mechanism of these 
interactions appears to be nonsystemic in nature, presumably resulting from 
sucralfate binding to the concomitant agent in the gastrointestinal tract. In 
all case studies to date (cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, norfloxacin, 
ofloxacin, and ranitidine), dosing the concomitant medication 2 hours before 
sucralfate eliminated the interaction. Because of the potential of sucralfate to 
alter the absorption of some drugs, sucralfate should be administered separately 
from other drugs when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical. In 
these cases, patients should be monitored appropriately.
                  
                  
                  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
Fertility
                     Chronic oral toxicity 
studies of 24 monthsâ€™ duration were conducted in mice and rats at doses up to 1 
g/kg (12 times the human dose). 
                  
                     There was no evidence of 
drug-related tumorigenicity. A reproduction study in rats at doses up to 38 
times the human dose did not reveal any indication of fertility impairment. 
Mutagenicity studies were not conducted.
