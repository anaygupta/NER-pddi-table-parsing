                        Although the pressor activity of DDAVP is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of DDAVP Tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigene and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution.
