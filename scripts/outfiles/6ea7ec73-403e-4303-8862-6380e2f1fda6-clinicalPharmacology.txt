                  6.9% FreAmine HBC速 solution provides a mixture of biologically utilizable essential and nonessential crystalline amino acids in concentrated form for protein synthesis. 6.9% FreAmine HBC速 contains a high concentration of the branched chain amino acids isoleucine, leucine, and valine relative to other general purpose amino acid injections. This amino acid solution, appropriately mixed with a concentrated calorie source such as hypertonic dextrose, with or without fat emulsion, and supplemented with electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals, provides total parenteral nutrition for the severely compromised patient. 6.9% FreAmine HBC速 solution may also be administered peripherally with minimal caloric supplementation in order to conserve lean body mass in the well-nourished, mildly catabolic patient.
                  The concentration of branched chain amino acids in 6.9% FreAmine HBC速 has been increased because these amino acids have been reported to be especially active metabolically in the compromised patient.
                  It is thought that the acetate from lysine acetate and acetic acid, under the condition of parenteral nutrition, does not impact net acid-base balance when renal and respiratory functions are normal. Clinical evidence seems to support this thinking; however, confirmatory experimental evidence is not available.
                  The amounts of sodium and chloride present are not of clinical significance.
