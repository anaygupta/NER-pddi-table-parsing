                  Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. These ions are normal constituents of the body fluids (principally extracellular) and are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance.
                  The small volume of fluid and amount of sodium chloride provided by Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 0.9% when used only as an isotonic vehicle for parenteral injection of drugs or for flushing of indwelling access devices, is unlikely to exert a significant effect on fluid and electrolyte balance except possibly in neonates and very small infants.
