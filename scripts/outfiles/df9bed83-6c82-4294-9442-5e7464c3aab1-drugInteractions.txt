                           Methylxanthines interfere with the activity of adenosine (7.1, 10)
                           Nucleoside transport inhibitors such as dipyridamole can increase the activity of adenosine (7.1) 
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Adenosine Injection
                     
                        
                           The vasoactive effects of adenosine are inhibited by adenosine receptor antagonists, (such as methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine, aminophylline, and theophylline). The safety and efficacy of adenosine injection in the presence of these agents has not been systematically evaluated [see Overdosage (10)].
                           
                           The vasoactive effects of adenosine are potentiated by nucleoside transport inhibitors such as dipyridamole. The safety and efficacy of adenosine in the presence of dipyridamole has not been systematically evaluated.
                           Whenever possible, drugs that might inhibit or augment the effects of adenosine should be withheld for at least five half-lives prior to the use of adenosine injection.
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Effects of Adenosine on Other Drugs
                     
                        Adenosine injection has been given with other cardioactive drugs (such as beta adrenergic blocking agents, cardiac glycosides, and calcium channel blockers) without apparent adverse interactions, but its effectiveness with these agents has not been systematically evaluated. Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, however, adenosine injection should be used with caution in the presence of these agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
