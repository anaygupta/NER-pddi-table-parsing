CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Corticosteroids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing.  They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation.  Since corticosteroids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant in a particular case.Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure.  In clinical studies of documented steroid-responders, fluorometholone demonstrated a significantly longer average time to produce a rise in intraocular pressure than dexamethasone phosphate; however, in a small percentage of individuals, a significant rise in intraocular pressure occurred within one week.  The ultimate magnitude of the rise was equivalent for both drugs.The anti-infective component in FML-SÂ® ophthalmic suspension is included to provide action against specific organisms susceptible to it.  Sulfacetamide sodium is active in vitro against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms:  Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus (viridans group), Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella species, and  Enterobacter  species.  Some strains of these bacteria may be resistant to sulfacetamide or resistant strains may emerge in vivo.Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus (viridans group), When a decision to administer both a corticosteroid and an antimicrobial is made, the administration of such drugs in combination has the advantage of greater patient compliance and convenience, with the added assurance that the appropriate dosage of both drugs is administered.  When both types of drugs are in the same formulation, compatibility of ingredients is assured and the correct volume of drug is delivered and retained.The relative potency of corticosteroid formulations depends on the molecular structure, concentration, and release from the vehicle.
