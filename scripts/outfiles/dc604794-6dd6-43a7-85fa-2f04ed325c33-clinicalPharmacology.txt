                  The action of HCG                             is virtually identical to that of pituitary LH, although HCG appears to                             have a small degree of FSH activity as well. It stimulates production of                             gonadal steroid hormones by stimulating the interstitial cells (Leydig                             cells) of the testis to produce androgens and the corpus luteum of the                             ovary to produce progesterone.
                  Androgen                             stimulation in the male leads to the development of secondary sex                             characteristics and may stimulate testicular descent when no anatomical                             impediment to descent is present. This descent is usually reversible                             when HCG is discontinued.
                  During the normal                             menstrual cycle, LH participates with FSH in the development and                             maturation of the normal ovarian follicle, and the mid-cycle LH surge                             triggers ovulation. HCG can substitute for LH in this function. During a                             normal pregnancy, HCG secreted by the placenta maintains the corpus                             luteum after LH secretion decreases, supporting continued secretion of                             estrogen and progesterone and preventing menstruation. HCG HAS NO KNOWN                             EFFECT ON FAT MOBILIZATION, APPETITE OR SENSE OF HUNGER, OR BODY FAT                             DISTRIBUTION.
