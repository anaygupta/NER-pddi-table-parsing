                  1.5% Glycine Irrigation, USP is useful as an irrigating solution for the urinary bladder because this solution is nonhemolytic, nonelectrolytic or very weakly ionized, and provides a high degree of visibility for urologic procedures requiring endoscopy. During transurethral surgical procedures, the solution acts as a lavage for removing blood and tissue fragments. It also maintains the patency of an indwelling catheter in the immediate postoperative period.
                  Glycine which enters the systemic circulation is converted to serine and glyoxylic acid.
