                        Serotonergic drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), triptans, bupropion, dextromethorphan, St. John's Wort): use with extreme caution due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. (7.1)
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
7.1 Use with Other Agents that Affect Serotonin Pathways

                     
                        Based on the mechanism of action of BELVIQ and the theoretical potential for serotonin syndrome, use with extreme caution in combination with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, including, but not limited to, triptans, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs, including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), dextromethorphan, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), bupropion, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
7.2 Cytochrome P450 (2D6) substrates

                     
                        Use caution when administering BELVIQ together with drugs that are CYP 2D6 substrates, as BELVIQ can increase exposure of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
