                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        TRIUMEQ is an HIV-1 antiviral agent [see Microbiology (12.4)].

                           Effects on Electrocardiogram
                        
                        A thorough QT trial has been conducted for dolutegravir. Neither the effects of abacavir nor lamivudine as single entities or the combination of abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine on the QT interval have been evaluated.
                        In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, 42 healthy subjects received single-dose oral administrations of placebo, dolutegravir 250‑mg suspension (exposures approximately 3–fold of the 50-mg once-daily dose at steady state), and moxifloxacin 400 mg (active control) in random sequence. After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTc change based on Fridericia correction method (QTcF) for dolutegravir was 2.4 msec (1-sided 95% upper CI: 4.9 msec). Dolutegravir did not prolong the QTc interval over 24 hours postdose.
                        
                           Effects on Renal Function
                        
                        The effect of dolutegravir on renal function was evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 3-arm, parallel, placebo-controlled trial in healthy subjects (n = 37) who received dolutegravir 50 mg once daily (n = 12), dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily (n = 13), or placebo once daily (n = 12) for 14 days. A decrease in creatinine clearance, as determined by 24-hour urine collection, was observed with both doses of dolutegravir after 14 days of treatment in subjects who received 50 mg once daily (9% decrease) and 50 mg twice daily (13% decrease). Neither dose of dolutegravir had a significant effect on the actual glomerular filtration rate (determined by the clearance of probe drug, iohexol) or effective renal plasma flow (determined by the clearance of probe drug, para-amino hippurate) compared with the placebo.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        
                           Pharmacokinetics in Adults
                        
                        One TRIUMEQ tablet was bioequivalent to one dolutegravir (TIVICAY) tablet (50 mg) plus one abacavir and lamivudine fixed-dose combination tablet (EPZICOM) under fasted conditions in healthy subjects (n = 62).
                        
                           Abacavir: Following oral administration, abacavir is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. After oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir in 20 subjects, Cmax was 4.26 ± 1.19 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and AUC∞ was 11.95 ± 2.51 mcg•hour per mL. Binding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50% and was independent of concentration. Total blood and plasma drug-related radioactivity concentrations are identical, demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase to form the 5′-carboxylic acid and glucuronyl transferase to form the 5′-glucuronide. In single-dose trials, the observed elimination half-life (t1/2) was 1.54 ± 0.63 hours. After intravenous administration, total clearance was 0.80 ± 0.24 L per hour per kg (mean ± SD).
                        
                           Dolutegravir: Following oral administration of dolutegravir, peak plasma concentrations were observed 2 to 3 hours postdose. With once-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved within approximately 5 days with average accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmax, and C24 h ranging from 1.2 to 1.5. Dolutegravir is a P-glycoprotein substrate in vitro. The absolute bioavailability of dolutegravir has not been established. Dolutegravir is highly bound (greater than or equal to 98.9%) to human plasma proteins based on in vivo data and binding is independent of plasma concentration of dolutegravir. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) following 50-mg once-daily administration is estimated at 17.4 L based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
                        Dolutegravir is primarily metabolized via UGT1A1 with some contribution from CYP3A. After a single oral dose of [14C] dolutegravir, 53% of the total oral dose is excreted unchanged in the feces. Thirty-one percent of the total oral dose is excreted in the urine, represented by an ether glucuronide of dolutegravir (18.9% of total dose), a metabolite formed by oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose), and its hydrolytic N-dealkylation product (3.6% of total dose). Renal elimination of unchanged drug was less than 1% of the dose. Dolutegravir has a terminal half-life of approximately 14 hours and an apparent clearance (CL/F) of 1.0 L per hour based on population pharmacokinetic analyses.
                        The pharmacokinetic properties of dolutegravir have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and HIV‑1‑infected adult subjects. Exposure to dolutegravir was generally similar between healthy subjects and HIV‑1‑infected subjects. 
                        
                           Table 6. Dolutegravir Steady-state Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimates in HIV-1– Infected Adults
                        
                        


                        


Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF): In 11 treatment-naïve subjects on dolutegravir 50 mg daily plus abacavir/lamivudine, the median dolutegravir concentration in CSF was 18 ng per mL (range: 4 ng per mL to 23.2 ng per mL) 2 to 6 hours postdose after 2 weeks of treatment. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been established. 
                        
                           Lamivudine: Following oral administration, lamivudine is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. After multiple-dose oral administration of lamivudine 300 mg once daily for 7 days to 60 healthy subjects, steady-state Cmax (Cmax,ss) was 2.04 ± 0.54 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and the 24-hour steady-state AUC (AUC24,ss) was 8.87 ± 1.83 mcg•hour per mL. Binding to plasma protein is low. Approximately 70% of an intravenous dose of lamivudine is recovered as unchanged drug in the urine. Metabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination. In humans, the only known metabolite is the trans-sulfoxide metabolite (approximately 5% of an oral dose after 12 hours). In most single-dose trials in HIV–1-infected subjects, HBV-infected subjects, or healthy subjects with serum sampling for 24 hours after dosing, the observed mean elimination half-life (t½) ranged from 5 to 7 hours. In HIV-1-infected subjects, total clearance was 398.5 ± 69.1 mL per min (mean ± SD).
                        
                           Effect of Food on Oral Absorption
                        
                        TRIUMEQ may be taken with or without food. Overall, when compared with fasted conditions, administration of TRIUMEQ to healthy adult subjects with a high-fat meal (53% fat, 869 calories) resulted in decreased Cmax for abacavir and increased Cmax and AUC for dolutegravir. Lamivudine exposures were not affected by food. With a high-fat meal, the Cmax of abacavir decreased 23% and the Cmax and AUC of dolutegravir increased 37% and 48%, respectively.
                        
                           Special Populations
                        
                        
                           Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the combination of abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine has not been evaluated.
                        
                           Abacavir: The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function.
                        
                           Dolutegravir: In a trial comparing 8 subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl less than 30 mL per min) with 8 matched healthy controls, AUC, Cmax, and C24 of dolutegravir were decreased by 40%, 23%, and 43%, respectively, compared with those in matched healthy subjects. The cause of this decrease is unknown. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that mild and moderate renal impairment had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of dolutegravir.
                        
                           Lamivudine: The pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have been determined in a small group of HIV-1-infected adults with impaired renal function (Table 7).
                        
                           Table 7. Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Mean  ± SD) After a Single 300-mg Oral Dose of Lamivudine in 3 Groups of Adults with Varying Degrees of Renal Function
                        
                        


                        



                           Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on the combination of abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine has not been evaluated.
                        
                           Abacavir: The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6). Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89% in the abacavir AUC and an increase of 58% in the half-life of abacavir after a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir. The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease; however, the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of abacavir have not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
                        
                           Dolutegravir: In a trial comparing 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score B) with 8 matched healthy controls, exposure of dolutegravir from a single 50-mg dose was similar between the 2 groups. The effect of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C) on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir has not been studied.
                        
                           Lamivudine: The pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have been determined in adults with impaired hepatic function. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered by diminishing hepatic function. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established in the presence of decompensated liver disease.
                        
                           Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of the combination of abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine in pediatric subjects have not been established.
                        
                           Geriatric Patients: Population analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from adult trials indicated age had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir. The pharmacokinetics of abacavir or lamivudine have not been studied in subjects older than 65 years.
                        
                           Gender: There are no significant or clinically relevant gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of the individual components (dolutegravir, abacavir, or lamivudine) based on the available information that was analyzed for each of the individual components.
                        
                           Race: There are no significant or clinically relevant racial differences in pharmacokinetics of the individual components (dolutegravir, abacavir, or lamivudine) based on the available information that was analyzed for each of the individual components.
                        
                           Drug Interactions
                        
                        The drug interaction trials described were conducted with dolutegravir, abacavir, and/or lamivudine as single entities; no drug interaction trials have been conducted using the combination of abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine. No clinically significant drug interactions are expected between dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine. 
                        Dosing recommendations as a result of established and other potentially significant drug-drug interactions with dolutegravir or abacavir are provided in Section 7.3 [see Drug Interactions (7)].

                           Abacavir or Lamivudine: The drug interactions described are based on trials conducted with abacavir or lamivudine as single entities.
                        Interferon Alfa:There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between lamivudine and interferon alfa in a trial of 19 healthy male subjects.
                        Methadone: In a trial of 11 HIV‑1‑infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily), with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22% (90% CI: 6% to 42%) [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
                        
                        Ribavirin: In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n = 18), stavudine (n = 10), or zidovudine (n = 6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
                        
                           Abacavir, Lamivudine, Zidovudine: Fifteen HIV‑1-infected subjects were enrolled in a crossover-designed drug interaction trial evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15%) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10%) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir.
                        
                           Lamivudine and Zidovudine: No clinically significant alterations in lamivudine or zidovudine pharmacokinetics were observed in 12 asymptomatic HIV‑1-infected adult patients given a single dose of zidovudine (200 mg) in combination with multiple doses of lamivudine (300 mg every 12 h).
                        The effects of other coadministered drugs on abacavir or lamivudine are provided in Table 10.

                     12.4 Microbiology
                     
                        
                           Mechanism of Action
                        
                        
                           Dolutegravir: Dolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. Strand transfer biochemical assays using purified recombinant HIV-1 integrase and pre-processed substrate DNA resulted in IC50 values of 2.7 nM and 12.6 nM.
                        
                           Abacavir: Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5′-triphosphate (dGTP). CBV-TP inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA.
                        
                           Lamivudine: Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active 5′-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (3TC-TP). The principal mode of action of 3TC-TP is inhibition of RT via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue.
                        
                           Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture
                        
                        
                           Dolutegravir: Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 with mean concentration of drug necessary to effect viral replication by 50 percent (EC50) values of 0.5 nM (0.21 ng per mL) to 2.1 nM (0.85 ng per mL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and MT-4 cells. Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against 13 clinically diverse clade B isolates with a median EC50 value of 0.54 nM (range: 0.41 to 0.60 nM) in a viral susceptibility assay using the integrase coding region from clinical isolates. Dolutegravir demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against a panel of HIV‑1 clinical isolates with median EC50 values of 0.18 nM (n = 3, range: 0.09 to 0.5 nM), 0.08 nM (n = 5, range: 0.05 to 2.14 nM) 0.12 nM (n = 4, range: 0.05 to 0.51 nM), 0.17 nM (n = 3, range: 0.16 to 0.35 nM), 0.24 nM (n = 3, range: 0.09 to 0.32 nM), 0.17 nM (range: 0.07 to 0.44 nM), 0.2 nM (n = 3, range: 0.02 to 0.87 nM), and 0.42 nM (n = 3, range: 0.41 to 1.79 nM) for clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and group O viruses, respectively. Dolutegravir EC50 values against three HIV-2 clinical isolates in PBMC assays ranged from 0.09 nM to 0.61 nM.
                        
                           Abacavir: The antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including in primary monocytes/macrophages and PBMCs. EC50 values ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 μM (1 μM = 0.28 mcg per mL) and 0.07 to 1.0 μM against HIV-1IIIB and HIV-1BaL, respectively, and was 0.26 ± 0.18 μM against 8 clinical isolates. The median EC50 values of abacavir were 344 nM (range: 14.8 to 676 nM), 16.9 nM (range: 5.9 to 27.9 nM), 8.1 nM (range: 1.5 to 16.7 nM), 356 nM (range: 35.7 to 396 nM), 105 nM (range: 28.1 to 168 nM), 47.6 nM (range: 5.2 to 200 nM), 51.4 nM (range: 7.1 to 177 nM), and 282 nM (range: 22.4 to 598 nM) against HIV‑1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B), respectively. The EC50 values against HIV‑2 isolates (n = 4), ranged from 0.024 to 0.49 μM.
                        
                           Lamivudine: The antiviral activity of lamivudine against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including monocytes and PBMCs using standard susceptibility assays. EC50 values were in the range of 0.003 to 15 μM (1 μM = 0.23 mcg per mL). The median EC50 values of lamivudine  were 60 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 35 nM (range: 30 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM), 20 nM (range: 3 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 1 to 60 nM), 30 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 30 nM (range: 3 to 70 nM), and 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM) against HIV‑1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B) respectively. The EC50 values against HIV‑2 isolates (n = 4) from 0.003 to 0.120 μM in PBMCs.
                        
                           Antiviral Activity in Combination with Other Antiviral Agents
                        
                        Neither dolutegravir, abacavir, nor lamivudine were antagonistic to all tested anti-HIV agents. See full prescribing information for ZIAGEN (abacavir), TIVICAY (dolutegravir), and EPIVIR (lamivudine).
                        
                           Resistance in Cell Culture
                        
                        
                           Dolutegravir: Dolutegravir-resistant viruses were selected in cell culture starting from different wild-type HIV‑1 strains and clades. Amino acid substitutions E92Q, G118R, S153F or Y, G193E or R263K emerged in different passages and conferred decreased susceptibility to dolutegravir of up to 4-fold. 
                        
                           Abacavir and Lamivudine: HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to the combination of abacavir and lamivudine have been selected in cell culture with amino acid substitutions M184V/I, K65R, L74V, and Y115F in HIV-1 RT. Substitution at M184I or V causes high-level resistance to lamivudine and approximately 2-fold decreased susceptibility to abacavir. Substitutions K65R, L74M, or Y115F with M184I or V conferred a 7- fold to 8-fold reduction in abacavir susceptibility, and combinations of three substitutions were required to confer more than an 8-fold reduction in susceptibility.
                        
                           Resistance in Clinical Subjects
                        
                        
                           Dolutegravir: No subjects in the treatment arm receiving dolutegravir + EPZICOM of SINGLE (treatment-naïve trial) had a detectable decrease in susceptibility to dolutegravir or background NRTIs in the resistance analysis subset (n = 8 with HIV-1 RNA greater than 400 copies per mL at failure or last visit through Week 96 and having resistance data). One subject in SINGLE with 275 copies per mL HIV-1 RNA had a treatment-emergent integrase substitution (E157Q/P) detected at Week 24, but no corresponding decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility. No treatment-emergent genotypic resistance to abacavir and lamivudine, components of TRIUMEQ, was observed in the arm receiving dolutegravir + EPZICOM in the SINGLE trial.
                        
                           Cross-resistance
                        
                        
                           Dolutegravir: The single INSTI-resistance substitutions T66K, I151L, and S153Y conferred a greater than 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.3-fold to 3.6-fold from reference). Combinations of multiple substitutions T66K/L74M, E92Q/N155H, G140C/Q148R, G140S/Q148H, R or K, Q148R/N155H, T97A/G140S/Q148, and substitutions at E138/G140/Q148 showed a greater than 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.5-fold to 21-fold from reference). In HIV-2 mutants, combinations of substitutions A153G/N155H/S163G and E92Q/T97A/N155H/S163D conferred 4-fold decreases in dolutegravir susceptibility, and E92Q/N155H and G140S/Q148R showed 8.5-fold and 17-fold decreases in dolutegravir susceptibility, respectively.
                        
                           Abacavir and Lamivudine: Cross‑resistance has been observed among NRTIs. The combination of abacavir/lamivudine has demonstrated decreased susceptibility to viruses with the substitutions K65R with or without the M184V/I substitution, viruses with L74V plus the M184V/I substitution, and viruses with thymidine analog mutations (TAMs: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219 E/R/H/Q/N) plus M184V. An increasing number of TAMs is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility.
