                           VICTRELIS is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 and is partly metabolized by CYP3A4/5. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy.

                     7.1	Potential for VICTRELIS to Affect Other Drugs
                     
                        Boceprevir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. Drugs metabolized primarily by CYP3A4/5 may have increased exposure when administered with VICTRELIS, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic and adverse effects. Boceprevir does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1 in vitro. In addition, boceprevir does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4/5 in vitro.
                        Boceprevir is a potential inhibitor of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) based on in vitro studies. In a drug interaction trial conducted with digoxin, VICTRELIS had limited p-glycoprotein inhibitory potential at clinically relevant concentrations.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect VICTRELIS
                     
                        Boceprevir is primarily metabolized by aldo-ketoreductase (AKR). In drug interaction trials conducted with AKR inhibitors diflunisal and ibuprofen, boceprevir exposure did not increase to a clinically significant extent. VICTRELIS may be coadministered with AKR inhibitors. 
                        Boceprevir is partly metabolized by CYP3A4/5. It is also a substrate for p-glycoprotein. Coadministration of VICTRELIS with drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4/5 could decrease or increase exposure to boceprevir.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	Established and Other Potential Significant Drug Interactions
                     
                        
                           Table 5 provides recommendations based on established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. VICTRELIS is contraindicated with drugs that are potent inducers of CYP3A4/5 and drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A4/5 for clearance, and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events [see Contraindications (4)].
