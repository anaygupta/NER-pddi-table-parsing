                        The pharmacodynamics of metronidazole in association with the treatment of rosacea are unknown.

                        Topical administration of a one gram dose of metronidazole gel USP, 1% to the face of 13 patients with moderate to severe rosacea once daily for 7 days resulted in a mean ± SD Cmax of metronidazole of 32 ± 9 ng/mL. The mean ± SD AUC(0-24) was 595 ± 154  ng*hr/mL.  The mean Cmax and AUC(0-24) are less than 1% of the value reported for a single 250 mg oral dose of metronidazole. The time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was 6-10 hours after topical application.
