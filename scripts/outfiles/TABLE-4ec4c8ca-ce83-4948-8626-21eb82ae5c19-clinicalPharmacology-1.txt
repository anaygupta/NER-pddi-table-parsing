<sup>a </sup>Organisms susceptible to tetracycline are also considered susceptible to doxycycline. However, some organisms that are intermediate or resistant to tetracycline may be susceptible to doxycycline</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<sup>b</sup> The current absence of resistance isolates precludes defining any results other than “Susceptible”. If isolates yielding MIC results other than susceptible, they should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<sup>c</sup> Gonococci with 30 mcg tetracycline disk zone diameters of &lt;19 mm usually indicate a plasmid­mediated tetracycline resistant <content stylecode="italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae </content>isolate. Resistance in these strains should be confirmed by a dilution test (MIC ≥ 16 mcg/mL)</paragraph>
