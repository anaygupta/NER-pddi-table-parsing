                  No specific interaction studies have been conducted with HYCOFENIX.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        • Opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol): Avoid using with HYCOFENIX; may exhibit additive CNS depression. (7.1)
    

• MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) or tricyclic antidepressants: Do not use. May increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone. (7.2)
    

• Anticholinergic drugs: Use with caution in order to avoid paralytic ileus and excessive anticholinergic effects. (7.3)
   
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.1 Opioids, Antihistamines, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety Agents, or Other CNS Depressants (Including Alcohol)
                     
                     
                        The use of opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants concomitantly with HYCOFENIX may cause an additive CNS depressant effect and should be avoided.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.2 MAO Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants
                     
                     
                        Do not prescribe HYCOFENIX if the patient is taking a prescription MAOI (i.e., certain drugs used for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson’s
  

disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping a MAOI drug. The use of MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the
  

antidepressant or hydrocodone. An increase in blood pressure of hypertensive crisis may also occur when pseudoephedrine containing preparations are used with MAOIs
