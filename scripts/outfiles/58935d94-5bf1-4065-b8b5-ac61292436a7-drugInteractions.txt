                              Furosemide and probably other loop diuretics given concomitantly with metolazone can cause unusually large or prolonged losses of fluid and electrolytes (see ).

                              When ZAROXOLYN Tablets are used with other antihypertensive drugs, care must be taken, especially during initial therapy.  Dosage adjustments of other antihypertensives may be necessary.

                              The hypotensive effects of these drugs may be potentiated by the volume contraction that may be associated with metolazone therapy.

                              Diuretic-induced hypokalemia can increase the sensitivity of the myocardium to digitalis.  Serious arrhythmias can result.

                              May increase the risk of hypokalemia and increase salt and water retention.

                              Diuretic-induced hypokalemia may enhance neuromuscular blocking effects of curariform drugs (such as tubocurarine) â€“ the most serious effect would be respiratory depression which could proceed to apnea.  Accordingly, it may be advisable to discontinue ZAROXOLYN three days before elective surgery.

                              May decrease the antihypertensive effects of ZAROXOLYN Tablets.

                              Metolazone may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine, but this diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.
