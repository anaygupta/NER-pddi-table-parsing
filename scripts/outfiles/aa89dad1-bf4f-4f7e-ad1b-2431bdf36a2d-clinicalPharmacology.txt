                  10% FreAmineÂ® III provides a physiological ratio of biologically utilizable amino acids in concentrated form for protein synthesis. Used with concentrated calorie sources such as hypertonic dextrose or fat emulsion, and with electrolytes, vitamins and minerals, it provides total parenteral nutrition. Administered peripherally as an isotonic solution (3%) without nonprotein calories or with minimal caloric supplementation such as 5% dextrose, it provides nutritional support and spares body protein.
                  Phosphate is a major intracellular anion which participates in providing energy for metabolism of substrates and contributes to significant metabolic and enzymatic reactions in all organs and tissues. It exerts a modifying influence on calcium levels, a buffering effect on acid-base equilibrium and has a primary role in the renal excretion of hydrogen ions.
                  It is thought that the acetate from lysine acetate and acetic acid, under the condition of parenteral nutrition, does not impact net acid-base balance when renal and respiratory functions are normal. Clinical evidence seems to support this thinking; however, confirmatory experimental evidence is not available.
                  The amounts of sodium and chloride present are not of clinical significance.
