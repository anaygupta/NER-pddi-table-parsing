                  ATROVENT HFA has been used concomitantly with other drugs, including sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, oral and inhaled steroids commonly used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. With the exception of albuterol, there are no formal studies fully evaluating the interaction effects of ATROVENT HFA and these drugs with respect to safety and effectiveness.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Anticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administration of Atrovent HFA with other anticholinergic-containing drugs (7.1)

                        There is potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Therefore, avoid coadministration of ATROVENT HFA with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects [
