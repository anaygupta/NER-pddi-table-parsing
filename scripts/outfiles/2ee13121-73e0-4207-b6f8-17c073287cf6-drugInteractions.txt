                        Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, cimetidine, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with morphine may exhibit an additive CNS depression. Morphine analgesia may be decreased when given concomitantly with phenothiazines. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be appropriately adjusted.
