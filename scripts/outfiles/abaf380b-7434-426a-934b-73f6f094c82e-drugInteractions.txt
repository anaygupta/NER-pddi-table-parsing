                  Clinical studies have not shown any drug interactions between bicalutamide and LHRH analogs (goserelin or leuprolide). There is no evidence that bicalutamide induces hepatic enzymes.
                  
                     In vitro studies have shown that R-bicalutamide is an inhibitor of CYP 3A4 with lesser inhibitory effects on CYP 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 activity. Clinical studies have shown that with co-administration of Bicalutamide Tablets, USP, mean midazolam (a CYP 3A4 substrate) levels may be increased 1.5 fold (for Cmax) and 1.9 fold (for AUC). Hence, caution should be exercised when Bicalutamide Tablets, USP are co-administered with CYP 3A4 substrates.
                  
                     In vitro protein-binding studies have shown that bicalutamide can displace coumarin anticoagulants from binding sites. Prothrombin times should be closely monitored in patients already receiving coumarin anticoagulants who are started on Bicalutamide Tablets, USP and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           R-bicalutamide is an inhibitor of CYP 3A4; therefore, caution should be used when Bicalutamide Tablets, USP are co-administered with CYP 3A4 substrates. (7)
                           Prothrombin times should be closely monitored in patient already receiving coumarin anticoagulants who are started on Bicalutamide Tablets, USP. (7)
