                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Doxycycline is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)
                           ].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration. Following single and multiple-dose administration of DORYX Tablets, 200 mg to adult volunteers, average peak plasma doxycycline concentration (Cmax) was 4.6 mcg/mL and 6.3 mcg/mL, respectively with median tmax of 3 hours; the corresponding mean plasma concentration values 24 hours after single and multiple doses were 1.5 mcg/mL and 2.3 mcg/mL, respectively. The mean Cmax and AUC 0-∞ of doxycycline are 24% and 13% lower, respectively, following single dose administration of DORYX Tablets, 100 mg with a high fat meal (including milk) compared to fasted conditions. The mean Cmax of doxycycline is 19% lower and the AUC 0-∞ is unchanged following single dose administration of DORYX Tablets, 150 mg with a high fat meal (including milk) compared to fasted conditions. The clinical significance of these decreases is unknown. Doxycycline bioavailability from DORYX Tablets, 200 mg was not affected by food, but the incidence of nausea was higher in fasted subjects. The 200 mg tablets may be administered without regard to meals.
                        When DORYX Tablets are sprinkled over applesauce and taken with or without water, the extent of doxycycline absorption is unchanged, but the rate of absorption is increased slightly.
                        Tetracyclines are concentrated in bile by the liver and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form. Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40%/72 hours in individuals with a creatinine clearance of about 75 mL/min. This percentage may fall as low as 1-5%/72 hours in individuals with a creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min.
                        Studies have shown no significant difference in the serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function. Hemodialysis does not alter the serum half-life.

                              To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of doxycycline hyclate and other antibacterial drugs, DORYX Tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.

                              Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Doxycycline has bacteriostatic activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram- negative bacteria. Cross-resistance between tetracyclines is common.
                              Doxycycline has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the package insert for DORYX Tablets [see Indications and Usage (1)
                                 ].

                              When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in resident hospitals to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial.

                                    Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method (broth and/or agar)5,6,8. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 2.

                                    Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. Zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standard test method5,7,8. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg doxycycline to test the susceptibility of bacteria to doxycycline. The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 2.

                                    For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to doxycycline can be determined by a standardized test method9. The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 2.
                                    


                                    


A report of Susceptible (S) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations at the infection site necessary to inhibit growth of the pathogen. A report of Intermediate (I) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the bacteria is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant (R) indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Quality Control
                              
                              Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of the supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Standard doxycycline and tetracycline powders should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 3. For the diffusion technique using the 30 mcg doxycycline disk the criteria noted in Table 3 should be achieved.
