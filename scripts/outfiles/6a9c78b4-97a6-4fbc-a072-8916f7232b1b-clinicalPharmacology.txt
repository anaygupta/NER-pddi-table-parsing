                  The mode of action of allergenic extracts is still under investigation. The pharmacological action of allergenic extracts used diagnostically is based on the liberation of histamine and other substances when the allergen reacts with IgE antibodies attached to the mast cells. When allergenic extracts are used for therapeutic immunotherapy, the effect is an increase in immunoglobulin G (IgG) and an increased T suppresser lymphocyte which interferes with the allergic response.(3) Although immunotherapy may be considered as immunosuppression, in which the production of allergen-specific antibody is inhibited, the mechanism of the clinical effectiveness of immunotherapy remains under investigation. Assignment of BAU/mL potency designation was determined based on Puncture and Intradermal Data with CBER Grass References.(2)

                  A.  Puncture Data with 10,000 BAU/mL Grass Extracts (bifurcated needle)
                  
                  


                  


B.  Intradermal Dose (BAU50) of CBER Grass References for 50 mm Sum of Erythema
                  


                  


C.  Potency of Selected Glycerinated Non-Standardized Grasses distributed by Nelco Laboratories, Inc.
                  


                  



                     The potency of the glycerinated non-standardized grass extracts are equivalent to or exceed the potency for standardized grass pollen extract (Range for equivalence to CBER reference labeled 100,000 BAU/mL is 67,300 to 148,600, and range for equivalence to CBER reference labeled 10,000 BAU/mL is 6,730 to 14,860).
