                           Strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine): Avoid use of HETLIOZ in combination with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors because of increased exposure (7.1, 12.3)
                           Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin): Avoid use of HETLIOZ in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers, because of decreased exposure (7.2, 12.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine)
                     
                        Avoid use of HETLIOZ in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors because of a potentially large increase in tasimelteon exposure and greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Strong CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin)
                     
                        Avoid use of HETLIOZ in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers because of a potentially large decrease in tasimelteon exposure with reduced efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
