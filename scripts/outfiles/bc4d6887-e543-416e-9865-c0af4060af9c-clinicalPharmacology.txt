                  High plasma levels of cefotetan are attained after intravenous administration of single doses to normal volunteers.
                  



                  


The plasma elimination half-life of cefotetan is 3 to 4.6 hours after intravenous administration.
                  Repeated administration of Cefotetan for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP does not result in accumulation of the drug in normal subjects.
                  Cefotetan is 88% plasma protein bound.
                  No active metabolites of cefotetan have been detected; however, small amounts (less than 7%) of cefotetan in plasma and urine may be converted to its tautomer, which has antimicrobial activity similar to the parent drug.
                  In normal patients, from 51% to 81% of an administered dose of cefotetan is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24 hour period, which results in high and prolonged urinary concentrations. Following intravenous doses of 1 gram and 2 grams, urinary concentrations are highest during the first hour and reach concentrations of approximately 1700 and 3500 mcg/mL, respectively.
                  In volunteers with reduced renal function, the plasma half-life of cefotetan is prolonged. The mean terminal half-life increases with declining renal function, from approximately 4 hours in volunteers with normal renal function to about 10 hours in those with moderate renal impairment. There is a linear correlation between the systemic clearance of cefotetan and creatinine clearance. When renal function is impaired, a reduced dosing schedule based on creatinine clearance must be used (see 
                        DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                     ).
                  In pharmacokinetics studies of eight elderly patients (greater than 65 years) with normal renal function and six healthy volunteers (aged 25 to 28 years), mean (Â±1 sd) Total Body Clearance (1.8 (0.1) L/h vs. 1.8 (0.3) L/h) and mean Volume of Distribution (10.4 (1.2) L vs. 10.3 (1.6) L) were similar following administration of a one gram intravenous bolus dose.
                  Therapeutic levels of cefotetan are achieved in many body tissues and fluids including:

                        The bactericidal action of cefotetan results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Cefotetan has in vitro activity against a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The methoxy group in the 7-alpha position provides cefotetan with a high degree of stability in the presence of beta-lactamases including both penicillinases and cephalosporinases of gram-negative bacteria.
                        Cefotetan has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections (see 
                              INDICATIONS AND USAGE

                                    Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of cefotetan powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:
                                    


                                    


A report of 'Susceptible' indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of 'Intermediate' indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of 'Resistant' indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.
                                    Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard cefotetan powder should provide the following MIC values:
                                    


                                 



                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Diffusion Techniques
                                 
                                    Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure2 requires the use of the standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg cefotetan to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to cefotetan.
                                    Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30 mcg cefotetan disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:
                                    


                                    


Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for cefotetan.
                                    As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30 mcg cefotetan disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains.
                                    


                                 



                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Anaerobic Techniques
                                 
                                    For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to cefotetan as MICs can be determined by standardized test methods3. The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the following criteria:
                                    


                                    


Interpretation is identical to that stated above for results using dilution techniques.
                                    As with other susceptibility techniques, the use of laboratory control microorganisms is required to control the technical aspects of the laboratory standardized procedures. Standardized cefotetan powder should provide the following MIC values:
