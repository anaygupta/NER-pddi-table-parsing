                     In vitro and in vivo data showed that palifermin interacts with unfractionated as well as low molecular weight heparins.  Heparin co-administration resulted in a 5-fold increase in palifermin systemic exposure.  Avoid co-administration of palifermin with heparin.  If heparin is used to maintain an intravenous line, rinse the line with saline prior to and after Kepivance administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                  Do not administer Kepivance within 24 hours before, during infusion of, or within 24 hours after administration of myelotoxic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14)].  In a clinical trial, administration of Kepivance within 24 hours of chemotherapy resulted in increased severity and duration of oral mucositis.
