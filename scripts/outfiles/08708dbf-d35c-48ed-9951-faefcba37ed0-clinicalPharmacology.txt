                  PharmacokineticsFollowing oral administration, terbinafine is well absorbed 
(>70%) and the bioavailability of terbinafine hydrochloride tablets as a 
result of first-pass metabolism is approximately 40%. Peak plasma concentrations 
of 1 µg/mL appear within 2 h after a single 250 mg dose; the AUC (area under the 
curve) is approximately 4.56 µg∙h/mL. An increase in the AUC of terbinafine of 
less than 20% is observed when terbinafine hydrochloride is administered with 
food. No clinically relevant age-dependent changes in steady-state plasma 
concentrations of terbinafine have been reported. In patients with renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 50mL/min) or hepatic cirrhosis, the clearance 
of terbinafine is decreased by approximately 50% compared to normal volunteers. 
No effect of gender on the blood levels of terbinafine was detected in clinical 
trials. In plasma, terbinafine is >99% bound to plasma proteins and there are 
no specific binding sites. At steady-state, in comparison to a single dose, the 
peak concentration of terbinafine is 25% higher and plasma AUC increases by a 
factor of 2.5; the increase in plasma AUC is consistent with an effective 
half-life of ~36 hours. Terbinafine is distributed to the sebum and skin. A 
terminal half-life of 200-400 h may represent the slow elimination of 
terbinafine from tissues such as skin and adipose. Prior to excretion, 
terbinafine is extensively metabolized. No metabolites have been identified that 
have antifungal activity similar to terbinafine. Approximately 70% of the 
administered dose is eliminated in the urine.
                  MicrobiologyTerbinafine hydrochloride is a synthetic allylamine derivative. 
Terbinafine hydrochloride is hypothesized to act by inhibiting squalene 
epoxidase, thus blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component 
of fungal cell membranes. In vitro, mammalian 
squalene epoxidase is only inhibited at higher (4000 fold) concentrations than 
is needed for inhibition of the dermatophyte enzyme. Depending on the 
concentration of the drug and the fungal species test in 
vitro, terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical 
significance of in vitro data is unknown.
                  Terbinafine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following 
microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical 
infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Trichophyton mentagrophytes Trichophyton rubrum
                  The following in vitro data are available, but 
their clinical significance is unknown. In vitro, 
terbinafine exhibits satisfactory MIC's against most strains of the 
following microorganisms; however, the safety and efficacy of terbinafine in 
treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been 
established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: Candida albicans Epidermophyton floccosum
