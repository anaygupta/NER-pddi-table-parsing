                        3% and 5% Sodium Chloride Injections USP provide electrolytes and are a source of water for hydration. They are capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient.
                        Sodium, the major cation of the extracellular fluid, functions primarily in the control of water distribution, fluid balance, and osmotic pressure of body fluids. Sodium is also associated with chloride and bicarbonate in the regulation of the acid-base equilibrium of body fluid. 
                        Chloride, the major extracellular anion, closely follows the metabolism of sodium, and changes in the acid-base balance of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration.
