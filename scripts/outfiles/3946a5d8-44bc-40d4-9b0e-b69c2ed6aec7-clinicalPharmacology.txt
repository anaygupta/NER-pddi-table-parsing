                  During the 24 hours following injection, Technetium Tc 99m-labeled TechneScan HDP is rapidly cleared from blood and other non-osseous tissues and accumulates in the skeleton and urine in humans.  Blood levels are about 10% of the injected dose at one hour post-injection and continue to fall to about 6%, 4% and 3% at 2, 3 and 4 hours, respectively.  When measured at 24 hours following its administration, skeletal retention is approximately 50% of the injected dose.  TechneScan HDP exhibits its greatest affinity for areas of altered osteogenesis and actively metabolizing bone.
