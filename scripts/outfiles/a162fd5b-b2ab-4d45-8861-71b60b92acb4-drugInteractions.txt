                  No specific drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with OXYTROL.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Other Anticholinergics (muscarinic antagonists): Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects.

                        7.1 Other Anticholinergics
                     
                     
                        The concomitant use of OXYTROL with other anticholinergic drugs, or with other agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence, and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.2 Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors
                     
                     
                        Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with patients concomitantly receiving cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin).
