                        There is inadequate systematic experience with the use of 
LIORESAL INTRATHECAL in combination with other medications to predict specific 
drug-drug interactions. Interactions attributed to the combined use of LIORESAL 
INTRATHECAL and epidural morphine include hypotension and dyspnea.
