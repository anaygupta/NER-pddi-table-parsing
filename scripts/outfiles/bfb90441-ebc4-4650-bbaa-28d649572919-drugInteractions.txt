                           Anticoagulants (oral): The activity of oral anticoagulants may be potentiated by antivitamin- K activity attributed to methimazole.
                        bâˆ’adrenergic blocking agents:Hyperthyroidism may cause increased clearance of beta blockers with a high extraction
                        ratio. A dose reduction of betaadrenergic blockers may be needed when a hyperthyroid patient becomes euthyroid.
                        
                           Digitalis glycosides: Serum digitalis levels may be increased when hyperthyroid patients on a stable digitalis 
                        glycoside regimen become euthyroid; reduced dosage of digitalis glycosides may be required.
                        
                           Theophylline: 
                        
                        Theophylline clearance may decrease when hyperthyroid patients on a stable theophylline regimen become euthyroid; a reduced
                        dose of theophylline may be needed.
