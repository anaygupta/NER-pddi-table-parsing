                  Dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection has a rapid onset but short duration of action when compared with less soluable preparations. Because of this, it is suitable for the treatment of acute disorders responsive to adrenocortical steriod therapy.
                  Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (bydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs, including dexamethasone, are primarily used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.
                  Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli.
                  At equipotent anti-inflammatory doses, dexamethasone almost completely lacks the sodium-retaining property of hydrocortisone and closely related derivatives of hydrocortisone.
