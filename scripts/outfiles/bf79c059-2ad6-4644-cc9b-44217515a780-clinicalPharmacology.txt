                  Lidocaine hydrochloride exerts an antiarrhythmic effect by increasing the electric stimulation threshold of the ventricle during diastole. In usual therapeutic doses, lidocaine hydrochloride produces no change in myocardial contractility, in systemic arterial pressure, or in absolute refractory period.
                  About 90% of an administered dose of the drug is metabolized in the liver. The remaining 10% is excreted unchanged via the kidneys.
                  Lidocaine toxicity is related to systemic blood levels. The decreased clearance and longer half-life of lidocaine should be taken into consideration with prolonged (24 hour) infusions. Constant rate of infusion may result in toxic accumulation of lidocaine. Infusion should be reduced to approximately one-half to compensate for decreased rate of clearance and concomitant or prior administration of propranolol may further increase blood concentrations by as much as 30% in patients without cardiac or hepatic failure. In clinical studies, patients over 65 years showed decreased lidocaine clearance. This was partly due to the tendency of elderly patients to have lower body weight and the increased risk of cardiac failure in these patients.
                  This solution provides approximately 170 calories per liter.
