                  Mechanism of Action
                     Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) 
that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal 
models. The mechanism of action of meloxicam, like that of other NSAIDs, may be 
related to prostaglandin synthetase (cyclo-oxygenase) inhibition.
                  Pharmacokinetics
                     
                     Absorption
                  
                  The absolute bioavailability of meloxicam capsules was 89% following a single 
oral dose of 30 mg compared with 30 mg IV bolus injection. Following single 
intravenous doses, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were shown in the range of 
5 mg to 60 mg. After multiple oral doses the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam 
capsules were dose-proportional over the range of 7.5 mg to 15 mg. Mean Cmax was achieved within four to five hours after a 7.5 mg 
meloxicam tablet was taken under fasted conditions, indicating prolonged drug 
absorption. With multiple dosing, steady state concentrations were reached by 
Day 5. A second meloxicam concentration peak occurs around 12 to 14 hours 
post-dose suggesting biliary recycling.
