                  Sincalide, a synthetically prepared C-terminal octapeptide of the natural hormone cholecystokinin, induces contraction of the gallbladder muscle, resulting in reduction of gallbladder size and evacuation of bile. Also, Sincalide, like cholecystokinin, stimulates secretion of pancreatic enzymes;Sincalide decreases intestinal transit time; delays gastric emptying; decreases esophageal sphincter tone; inhibits gastric secretions; and stimulates intestinal muscle. Maximum contraction (40% reduction in size) of gallbladder occurs 5 to 15 minutes after injection. Gallbladder returns to basal size within 1 hour
