                  Sulconazole nitrate is an imidazole derivative with broad-spectrum antifungal activity that inhibits the growth in vitro of the common pathogenic dermatophytes including Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum and Microsporum canis. It also inhibits (in vitro) the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur. Sulconazole nitrate has been shown to be active in vitro against the following microorganisms, although clinical efficacy has not been established: Candida albicans and certain gram positive bacteria.
                  A modified Draize test showed no allergic contact dermatitis and a phototoxicity study showed no phototoxic or photoallergic reaction to sulconazole nitrate cream. Maximization tests with sulconazole nitrate cream showed no evidence of contact sensitization or irritation.
