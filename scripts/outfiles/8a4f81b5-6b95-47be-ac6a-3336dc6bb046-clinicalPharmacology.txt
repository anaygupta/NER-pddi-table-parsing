                  Salicylic acid is a keratolytic that has been shown to produce desquamation of the stratum corneum of the skin while not effecting qualitative or quantitative changes in the structure of the viable epidermis.  The exact mechanism of action is unknown, however, it has been attributed  to the dissolution of intercellular adhesions.  While topical administration can lead to systemic absorption, systemic toxic reactions are usually associated with much higher serum concentrations (30 to 40 mg/100 ml).  Occlusion can lead to higher systemic absorption.
                  Almost 95% of a single dose of salicylate is excreted within 24 hours of its entrance into the extracellular space.  The major metabolites identified in the urine after topical administration are salicyluric acid (52%), salicylate glucuronides (42%), and free salicylic acid (6%).  The urinary metabolites after percutaneous absorption differ from those after oral salicylate administration; those derived from percutaneous absorption contain more glucuronides and less salicyluric and salicylic acid.
