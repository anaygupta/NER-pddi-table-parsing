                  The pharmacokinetic interaction between neostigmine methylsulfate and other drugs has not been studied.  Neostigmine methylsulfate is metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver.  Use with caution when using BLOXIVERZ with other drugs which may alter the activity of metabolizing enzymes or transporters.
