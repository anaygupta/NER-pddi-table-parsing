                        Dulaglutide slows gastric emptying and may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications (7.1, 12.3).

                        TRULICITY slows gastric emptying and thus has the potential to reduce the rate of absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with TRULICITY. Drug levels of oral medications with a narrow therapeutic index should be adequately monitored when concomitantly administered with TRULICITY. In clinical pharmacology studies, TRULICITY did not affect the absorption of the tested, orally administered medications to a clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
