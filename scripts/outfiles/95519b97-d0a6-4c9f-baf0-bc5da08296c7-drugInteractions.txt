                  A major step in roflumilast metabolism is the N-oxidation of roflumilast to roflumilast N-oxide by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Use with inhibitors of CYP3A4 or dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 (e.g, erythromycin, ketoconazole, fluvoxamine, enoxacin, cimetidine) will increase roflumilast systemic exposure and may result in increased adverse reactions. The risk of such concurrent use should be weighed carefully against benefit.

                     7.1 Drugs That Induce Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes

                     
                        Strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers decrease systemic exposure to roflumilast and may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of DALIRESP. Therefore the use of strong cytochrome P450 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and phenytoin) with DALIRESP is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Drugs That Inhibit Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes

                     
                        The co-administration of DALIRESP (500 mcg) with CYP3A4 inhibitors or dual inhibitors that inhibit both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 simultaneously (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, fluvoxamine, enoxacin, cimetidine) may increase roflumilast systemic exposure and may result in increased adverse reactions. The risk of such concurrent use should be weighed carefully against benefit [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Oral Contraceptives Containing Gestodene and Ethinyl Estradiol

                     
                        The co-administration of DALIRESP (500 mcg) with oral contraceptives containing gestodene and ethinyl estradiol may increase roflumilast systemic exposure and may result in increased side effects. The risk of such concurrent use should be weighed carefully against benefit [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
