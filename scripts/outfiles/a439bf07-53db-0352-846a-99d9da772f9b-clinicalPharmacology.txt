                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single-strand breaks. The cytotoxicity of topotecan is thought to be due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis, when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topotecan, topoisomerase I, and DNA. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        The dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan is leukopenia. White blood cell count decreases with increasing topotecan dose or topotecan AUC. When topotecan is administered at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2/day for 5 days, an 80% to 90% decrease in white blood cell count at nadir is typically observed after the first cycle of therapy.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of topotecan have been evaluated in cancer patients following doses of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute infusion. Topotecan exhibits multiexponential pharmacokinetics with a terminal half-life of 2 to 3 hours. Total exposure (AUC) is approximately dose-proportional. 
                        Distribution: Binding of topotecan to plasma proteins is about 35%. 
                        Metabolism: Topotecan undergoes a reversible pH-dependent hydrolysis of its lactone moiety; it is the lactone form that is pharmacologically active. At pH ≤4, the lactone is exclusively present, whereas the ring-opened hydroxy-acid form predominates at physiologic pH. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate topotecan is metabolized to an N-demethylated metabolite. The mean metabolite:parent AUC ratio was about 3% for total topotecan and topotecan lactone following IV administration. 
                        Excretion: Renal clearance is an important determinant of topotecan elimination.
                        In a mass balance/excretion trial in 4 patients with solid tumors, the overall recovery of total topotecan and its N-desmethyl metabolite in urine and feces over 9 days averaged 73.4% ± 2.3% of the administered IV dose. Mean values of 50.8% ± 2.9% as total topotecan and 3.1% ± 1.0% as N-desmethyl topotecan were excreted in the urine following IV administration. 
                        Fecal elimination of total topotecan accounted for 17.9% ± 3.6% while fecal elimination of N­ desmethyl topotecan was 1.7% ± 0.6%. An O-glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N­desmethyl topotecan has been identified in the urine. These metabolites, topotecan-O glucuronide and N-desmethyl topotecan-O-glucuronide, were less than 2% of the administered dose. 
                        Effect of Gender: The overall mean topotecan plasma clearance in male patients was approximately 24% higher than that in female patients, largely reflecting difference in body size. 
                        Effect of Age: Topotecan pharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in an elderly population, but population pharmacokinetic analysis in female patients did not identify age as a significant factor. Decreased renal clearance, which is common in the elderly, is a more important determinant of topotecan clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 
                        Effect of Race: The effect of race on topotecan pharmacokinetics has not been studied. 
                        Effect of Renal Impairment: In patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 40 to 60 mL/min.), topotecan plasma clearance was decreased to about 67% of the value in patients with normal renal function. In patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr of 20 to 39 mL/min.), topotecan plasma clearance was reduced to about 34% of the value in control patients, with an increase in half-life. Mean half-life, estimated in 3 patients with renal impairment, was about 5.0 hours. Dosage adjustment is recommended for these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 
                        Effect of Hepatic Impairment: Plasma clearance in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin levels between 1.7 and 15.0 mg/dL) was decreased to about 67% of the value in patients without hepatic impairment. Topotecan half-life increased slightly, from 2.0 hours to 2.5 hours, but these patients with hepatic impairment tolerated the usual recommended topotecan dosage regimen. 
                        Drug Interactions: Pharmacokinetic trials of the interaction of topotecan with concomitantly administered medications have not been formally investigated.In vitro inhibition studies using marker substrates known to be metabolized by human P450 CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A, or CYP4A or dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase indicate that the activities of these enzymes were not altered by topotecan. Enzyme inhibition by topotecan has not been evaluated in vivo. 
                        No pharmacokinetic data are available following topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/day for 3 consecutive days) and cisplatin (50 mg/m2/day on day 1) in patients with cervical cancer. 
                        Myelosuppression was more severe when topotecan hydrochloride for injection was given in combination with cisplatin. [see Drug Interactions (7)
                           ].
