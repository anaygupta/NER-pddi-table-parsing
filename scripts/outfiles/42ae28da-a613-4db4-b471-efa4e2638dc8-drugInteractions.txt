Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: As noted above ("Derangements of Serum Electrolytes"), the net effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently.Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: As noted above ("Derangements of Serum Electrolytes"), the net effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged.

Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Fosinopril sodium-hydrochlorothaizde and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium.

Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat were reduced when fosinopril was coadministered with an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. If concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours.Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat were reduced when fosinopril was coadministered with an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.

Other: The bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat is not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with aspirin, chlorthalidone, cimetidine, digoxin, metoclopramide, nifedipine, propranolol, propantheline, or warfarin. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with betaadrenergic blockers, presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system.Other: The bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat is not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with Interaction studies with warfarin have failed to identify any clinically important effects of fos-inopril on the serum concentration or clinical effects of the anticoagulant.warfarin have failed to identify any clinically important effects of fos-inopril on the serum concentration or clinical effects of the anticoagulant.Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged.Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.norepinephrine, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.Thiazides may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine.tubocurarine.The diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; the effects (if any) of these agents on the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have not been studied.nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; the effects (if any) of these agents on the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have not been studied.By alkalinizing the urine, hydrochlorothiazide may decrease the effectiveness of methenamine.methenamine.







Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins.
