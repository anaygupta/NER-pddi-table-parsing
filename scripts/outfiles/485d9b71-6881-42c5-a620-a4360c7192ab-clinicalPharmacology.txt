                     12.1 Mechanism of Action

                     
                        BOTOX Cosmetic blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP-25, a pre-synaptic protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within nerve endings. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, BOTOX Cosmetic produces partial chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity. In addition, the muscle may atrophy, axonal sprouting may occur, and extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors may develop. There is evidence that reinnervation of the muscle may occur, thus slowly reversing muscle denervation produced by BOTOX Cosmetic.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics

                     
                        No formal pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with BOTOX Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics

                     
                        Using currently available analytical technology, it is not possible to detect BOTOX Cosmetic in the peripheral blood following intramuscular injection at the recommended doses.
