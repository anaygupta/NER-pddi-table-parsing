               CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYWarfarin sodium and other coumarin anticoagulants act by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K dependent clotting factors, whichinclude Factors II, VII, IX and X, and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Half-lives of these clotting factors are as follows: Factor II- 60 hours, VII - 4 to 6 hours, IX - 24 hours, and X - 48 to 72 hours. The half-lives of proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and30 hours, respectively. The resultant in vivo effect is a sequential depression of Factor VII, Protein C, Factor IX, Protein S, and FactorX and II activities. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post ribosomal synthesis of the vitamin K dependent clotting factors. Thevitamin promotes the biosynthesis of g-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the proteins which are essential for biological activity. page 2 of 24
