                  Intralipid® 20% is metabolized and utilized as a source of energy causing an increase in heat production, decrease in respiratory quotient and increase in oxygen consumption. The infused fat particles are cleared from the blood stream in a manner thought to be comparable to the clearing of chylomicrons.
                  Intralipid® 20% will prevent the biochemical lesions of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), and correct the clinical manifestations of the EFAD syndrome.
