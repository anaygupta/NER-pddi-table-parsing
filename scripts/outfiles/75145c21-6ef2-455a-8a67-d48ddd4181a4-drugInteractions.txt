									In a study of 27 healthy female subjects between the ages of 20–55 years receiving a combination oral contraceptive tablet containing 1 mg norethindrone and 35 mcg ethynyl estradiol, concomitant use of tazarotene did not affect the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethynyl estradiol over a complete cycle.

                        
The impact of tazarotene on the pharmacokinetics of progestin only oral contraceptives (i.e., minipills) has not been evaluated.
