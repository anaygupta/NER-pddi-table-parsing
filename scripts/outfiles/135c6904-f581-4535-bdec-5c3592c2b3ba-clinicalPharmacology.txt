                  Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is an alpha receptor sympathetic agonist used in local ocular disorders because of its vasoconstrictor and mydriatic action. It exhibits rapid and moderately prolonged action, and it produces little rebound vasodilation. Systemic side effects are uncommon.

                  Although rare, systemic absorption of sufficient quantities of phenylephrine may lead to systemic Î±-adrenergic affects, such as a rise in blood pressure which may be accompanied by a reflex atropine-sensitive bradycardia.
