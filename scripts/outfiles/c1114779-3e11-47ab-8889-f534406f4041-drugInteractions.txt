                        Beta-Blockers: Patients who are taking non-selective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. Patients with cardiovascular diseases and/or pulmonary diseases such as symptomatic unstable, steroid-dependent asthma, and/or those who are receiving cardiovascular drugs such as beta-blockers, may be at higher risk for severe adverse reactions. 
                        Antihistamines can significantly inhibit the immediate skin test reactions. If long acting antihistamines have been taken recently, it is recommended that they should be stopped for the following minimum intervals before skin testing is performed: 1 week for hydroxyzine or cetirizine; 4 to 7 days for loratadine; 3 to 4 days for  fexofenadine; and 24 to 48 hours for other sustained release antihistamines.
