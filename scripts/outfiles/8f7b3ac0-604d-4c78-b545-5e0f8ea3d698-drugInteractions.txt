                     7.1 Calcium Channel Blockers

                     
                        Cardiovascular collapse in association with marked hyperkalemia has been reported in patients receiving dantrolene in combination with calcium channel blockers. The concomitant use of RYANODEX and calcium channel blockers is not recommended during the treatment of malignant hyperthermia.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Muscle Relaxants

                     
                        The concomitant administration of RYANODEX with muscle relaxants may potentiate the neuromuscular block.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Antipsychotics and Antianxiety Agents

                     
                        The concomitant administration of RYANODEX with antipsychotic and antianxiety agents may potentiate their effects on the central nervous system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
