                  Since adefovir is eliminated by the kidney, coadministration of HEPSERA with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either adefovir and/or these coadministered drugs  [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  
                  Patients should be monitored closely for adverse events when HEPSERA is coadministered with drugs that are excreted renally or with other drugs known to affect renal function [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2)
                     ]. 
                  HEPSERA should not be administered in combination with VIREAD [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)
                     ].
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Coadministration with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of adefovir or the coadministered drug. Monitor for HEPSERA associated adverse events. (7)
