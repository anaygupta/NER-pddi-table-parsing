                                 CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN COUMARIN ANTICOAGULANTS ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH FENOFIBRATE CAPSULES. THE DOSAGE OF THE ANTICOAGULANTS SHOULD BE REDUCED TO MAINTAIN THE PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR AT THE DESIRED LEVEL TO PREVENT BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS. FREQUENT PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR DETERMINATIONS ARE ADVISABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY DETERMINED THAT THE PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR HAS STABILIZED.
                              
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
                           
                              The combined use of fenofibrate capsules and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination (see ).
                                            WARNINGS
                              
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Resins
                           
                              Since bile acid sequestrants may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take fenofibrate capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Cyclosporine
                           
                              Because cyclosporine can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs including fenofibrate capsules, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration. The benefits and risks of using fenofibrate capsules with immunosuppressants and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed.
