                     Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Theophylline has two distinct actions in the airways of patients with reversible obstruction; smooth muscle relaxation (i.e., bronchodilation) and suppression of the response of the airways to stimuli (i.e., non-bronchodilator prophylactic effects). While the mechanisms of action of theophylline  are  not  known  with  certainty,  studies  in  animals  suggest  that  bronchodilatation  is mediated by the inhibition of two isozymes of phosphodiesterase (PDE III and, to a lesser extent, PDE IV)  while  non-bronchodilator  prophylactic  actions  are  probably  mediated  through  one  or  more different molecular mechanisms, that do not involve inhibition of PDE III or antagonism of adenosine receptors.  Some  of  the  adverse  effects  associated  with  theophylline  appear  to  be  mediated  by inhibition of PDE III (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and emesis) and adenosine receptor antagonism (e.g., alterations in cerebral blood flow).
                        Theophylline increases the force of contraction of diaphragmatic muscles. This action appears to be due to enhancement of calcium uptake through an adenosine-mediated channel.

                              Overview
                           

                        Theophylline  is  rapidly  and  completely  absorbed  after  oral  administration  in  solution  or immediate-release solid oral dosage form. Theophylline does not undergo any appreciable pre-systemic elimination, distributes freely into fat-free tissues and is extensively metabolized in the liver. The pharmacokinetics of theophylline vary widely among similar patients and cannot be predicted by age, sex, body weight or other demographic characteristics. In addition, certain concurrent illnesses and alterations in normal physiology (See 
                        Table I

                        ) and co-administration of other drugs (See 
                        Table II

                        ) can significantly alter the pharmacokinetic characteristics of theophylline. Within-subject variability in  metabolism  has  also  been  reported  in  some  studies,  especially  in  acutely  ill  patients.  It  is, therefore, recommended that serum theophylline concentrations be measured frequently in acutely ill patients (e.g., at 24-hour intervals) and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy, e.g., at 6-12 month intervals. More frequent measurements should be made in the presence of any condition that may significantly alter theophylline clearance (see 
                        
                              PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests
                           

                        ).
                        


                        


Note: In addition to the factors listed above, theophylline clearance is increased and half-life decreased by low carbohydrate/high protein diets, parenteral nutrition, and daily consumption of charcoal-broiled beef. A high carbohydrate/low protein diet can decrease the clearance and prolong the half-life of theophylline.

                        In a single-dose crossover study, two 400 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets were  administered  to  19  normal  volunteers  in  the  morning  or  evening  immediately  following  the same standardized meal (769 calories consisting of 97 grams carbohydrates, 33 grams protein and 27 grams fat). There was no evidence of dose dumping nor were there any significant differences in pharmacokinetic  parameters  attributable  to time  of  drug  administration. On the morning arm, the

                        A study in which Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release 400 mg Tablets were administered to 17 fed adult asthmatics produced similar theophylline level-time curves when administered in the morning or evening. Serum levels were generally higher in the evening regimen but there were no statistically significant differences between the two regimens.
                        


                        


A single-dose study in 15 normal fasting male volunteers whose theophylline inherent mean elimination half-life was verified by a liquid theophylline product to be 6.9±2.5 (SD) hours were administered two or three Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended Release 400 mg Tablets. The relative bioavailability of Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets given in the fasting state in comparison to an immediate-release product was 59%. Peak serum theophylline levels occurred at 6.9±5.2 (SD) hours, with a normalized (to 800 mg) peak level being 6.2±2.1 (SD). The apparent elimination half-life for the 400 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets was 17.2±5.8 (SD) hours.
                        Steady-state pharmacokinetics were determined in a study in 12 fasted patients with chronic reversible obstructive pulmonary disease. All were dosed with two 400 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets given once daily in the morning and a reference controlled-release BID product administered as two 200 mg tablets given 12 hours apart. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained for Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets given at doses of 800 mg once daily in the morning were virtually identical to the corresponding parameters for the reference drug when given as 400 mg BID. In particular, the AUC, C

                        values obtained in this study were as follows:
                        


                        


Single-dose studies in which subjects were fasted for twelve (12) hours prior to and an additional four (4) hours following dosing, demonstrated reduced bioavailability as compared to dosing with food. One single-dose study in 20 normal volunteers dosed with two (2) 400 mg tablets in the morning, compared dosing under these fasting conditions with dosing immediately prior to a standardized breakfast (769 calories, consisting of 97 grams carbohydrates, 33 grams protein and 27 grams fat). Under fed conditions, the pharmacokinetic parameters were: AUC=231.7±92.4 mcg hr/mL, C
                        max

                        =8.4±2.6 mcg/mL, T

                        =17.3±6.7 hours. Under fasting conditions, these parameters were AUC=141.2±6.53 mcg hr/mL, C
                        max

                        =5.5±1.5 mcg/mL, T
                        max

                        =6.5±2.1 hours.
                        Another single-dose study in 21 normal male volunteers, dosed in the evening, compared fasting to a standardized high calorie, high fat meal (870-1,020 calories, consisting of 33 grams protein, 55-75 grams fat, 58 grams carbohydrates). In the fasting arm subjects received one Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release 400 mg Tablet at 8 p.m. after an eight hour fast followed by a further four hour fast. In the fed arm, subjects were again dosed with one 400 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablet, but at 8 p.m. immediately after the high fat content standardized meal cited above. The pharmacokinetic parameters (normalized to 800 mg) fed were AUC=221.8±40.9 mcg hr/mL, C
                        max

                        =10.9±1.7 mcg/mL, T
                        max

                        =11.8±2.2 hours. In the fasting arm, the pharmacokinetic parameters (normalized to 800 mg) were AUC=146.4±40.9 mcg hr/mL, C
                        max

                        =6.7±1.7 mcg/mL, T

                        =7.3±2.2 hours.
                        Thus, administration of single Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release doses to healthy normal volunteers, under prolonged fasted conditions (at least 10 hour overnight fast before dosing followed by an additional four (4) hour fast after dosing) results in decreased bioavailability. However, there was no failure of this delivery system leading to a sudden and unexpected release of a large quantity of theophylline with Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets even when they are administered with a high fat, high calorie meal.
                        Similar studies were conducted with the 600 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablet. A single-dose study in 24 subjects with an established theophylline clearance of ≤4 L/hr, compared the pharmacokinetic evaluation of one 600 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablet and one and one-half 400 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets under fed (using a standard high fat diet) and fasted conditions. The results of this 4-way randomized crossover study demonstrate the bioequivalence of the 400 mg and 600 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets. Under fed conditions, the pharmacokinetic results for the one and one-half 400 mg tablets were AUC=214.64±55.88 mcg hr/mL, C
                        max

                        =9.00±2.64 hours, and for the 600 mg tablet were AUC=207.85±48.9 mcg hr/mL, C
                        max

                        =10.39±1.91 mcg/mL and T
                        max

                        =9.58±1.86 hours. Under fasted conditions the pharmacokinetic results for the one and one-half 400 mg tablets were AUC=191.85 ±51.1 mcg hr/mL, C
                        max

                        = 7.37±1.83 mcg/mL and T
                        max

                        =8.08±4.39 hours; and for the 600 mg tablet were AUC=199.39±70.27 mcg hr/mL, C
                        max

                        =7.66±2.09 mcg/mL and T

                        =9.67±4.89 hours.
                        In this study the mean fed/fasted ratios for the one and one-half 400 mg tablets and the 600 mg tablet were about 112% and 104%, respectively.
                        In another study, the bioavailability of the 600 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablet was examined with morning and evening administration. This single-dose, crossover study in 22 healthy males was conducted under fed (standard high fat diet) conditions. The results demonstrated no clinically significant difference in the bioavailability of the 600 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablet administered in the morning or in the evening. The results were: AUC=233.6±45.1 mcg hr/mL, C

                        The absorption characteristics of Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets (theophylline, anhydrous) have been extensively studied. A steady-state crossover bioavailability study in 22 normal males compared two Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release 400 mg Tablets administered q24h at 8 a.m. immediately after breakfast with a reference controlled-release theophylline product administered BID in fed subjects at 8 a.m. immediately after breakfast and 8 p.m. immediately after dinner (769 calories, consisting of 97 grams carbohydrates, 33 grams protein and 27 grams fat).
                        The pharmacokinetic parameters for Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release 400 mg Tablets under these steady-state conditions were AUC=203.3±87.1 mcg hr/mL, C

                        The bioavailability of the 600 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablet was further evaluated in a multiple dose, steady-state study in 26 healthy males comparing the 600 mg Tablet to one and one-half 400 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets. All subjects had previously established theophylline clearances of ≤4 L/hr and were dosed once-daily for 6 days under fed conditions. The results showed no clinically significant difference between the 600 mg and one and one-half 400 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablet regimens. Steady-state results were:
                        


                        


The bioavailability ratio for the 600/400 mg tablets was 98.8%. Thus, under all study conditions the 600 mg tablet is bioequivalent to one and one-half 400 mg tablets.
                        Studies demonstrate that as long as subjects were either consistently fed or consistently fasted, there is similar bioavailability with once-daily administration of Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets whether dosed in the morning or evening.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Distribution
                     
                        Once  theophylline  enters  the  systemic  circulation,  about  40%  is  bound  to  plasma protein, primarily albumin. Unbound theophylline distributes throughout body water, but distributes poorly into body fat. The apparent volume of distribution of theophylline is approximately 0.45 L/kg (range 0.3-0.7 L/kg) based on ideal body weight. Theophylline passes freely across the placenta, into breast milk and into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Saliva theophylline concentrations approximate unbound  serum  concentrations,  but  are  not  reliable  for  routine  or  therapeutic  monitoring  unless special techniques are used. An increase in the volume of distribution of theophylline, primarily due to reduction in plasma protein binding, occurs in premature neonates, patients with hepatic cirrhosis, uncorrected  acidemia,  the  elderly  and  in  women  during  the  third  trimester  of  pregnancy.  In  such cases, the patient may show signs of toxicity at total (bound + unbound) serum concentrations of theophylline  in  the  therapeutic  range  (10-20  mcg/mL)  due  to  elevated  concentrations  of  the pharmacologically active unbound drug. Similarly, a patient with decreased theophylline binding may have  a  sub-therapeutic  total  drug  concentration  while  the pharmacologically  active  unbound concentration is in the therapeutic range. If only total serum theophylline concentration is measured, this may lead to an unnecessary and potentially dangerous dose increase. In patients with reduced protein binding, measurement of unbound serum theophylline concentration provides a more reliable means of dosage adjustment than measurement of total serum theophylline concentration. Generally, concentrations of unbound theophylline should be maintained in the range of 6-12 mcg/mL.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Metabolism
                     
                        Following oral dosing, theophylline does not undergo any measurable first-pass elimination. In adults and children beyond one year of age, approximately 90% of the dose is metabolized in the liver. Biotransformation takes place through demethylation to 1-methylxanthine and 3-methylxanthine and hydroxylation to 1,3-dimethyluric acid. 1-methylxanthine is further hydroxylated, by xanthine oxidase, to 1-methyluric acid. About 6% of a theophylline dose is N-methylated to caffeine. Theophylline demethylation to 3-methylxanthine is catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 1A2, while cytochromes P-450 2E1 and P-450 3A3 catalyze the hydroxylation to 1,3-dimethyluric acid. Demethylation to 1-methylxanthine appears to be catalyzed either by cytochrome P-450 1A2 or a closely related cytochrome. In neonates, the N-demethylation pathway is absent while the function of the hydroxylation pathway is markedly deficient. The activity of these pathways slowly increases to maximal levels by one year of age.
                        Caffeine and 3-methylxanthine are the only theophylline metabolites with pharmacologic activity. 3-methylxanthine has approximately one tenth the pharmacologic activity of theophylline and serum concentrations in adults with normal renal function are <1 mcg/mL. In patients with end-stage renal disease, 3-methylxanthine may accumulate to concentrations that approximate the unmetabolized theophylline concentration. Caffeine concentrations are usually undetectable in adults regardless of renal function. In neonates, caffeine may accumulate to concentrations that approximate the unmetabolized theophylline concentration and thus, exert a pharmacologic effect.
                        Both the N-demethylation and hydroxylation pathways of theophylline biotransformation are capacity-limited. Due to the wide intersubject variability of the rate of theophylline metabolism, non-linearity of elimination may begin in some patients at serum theophylline concentrations <10 mcg/mL. Since this non-linearity results in more than proportional changes in serum theophylline concentrations with changes in dose, it is advisable to make increases or decreases in dose in small increments in order to achieve desired changes in serum theophylline concentrations (see

                        is not possible, but patients with very high initial clearance rates (i.e., low steady-state serum theophylline concentrations at above average doses) have the greatest likelihood of experiencing large changes in serum theophylline concentration in response to dosage changes.

                        In neonates, approximately 50% of the theophylline dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Beyond the first three months of life, approximately 10% of the theophylline dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The remainder is excreted in the urine mainly as 1,3-dimethyluric acid (35-40%), 1-methyluric acid (20-25%) and 3-methylxanthine (15-20%). Since little theophylline is excreted unchanged in the urine and since active metabolites of theophylline (i.e., caffeine, 3-methylxanthine) do not accumulate to clinically significant levels even in the face of end-stage renal disease, no dosage adjustment for renal insufficiency is necessary in adults and children >3 months of age. In contrast, the large fraction of the theophylline dose excreted in the urine as unchanged theophylline and caffeine in neonates requires careful attention to dose reduction and frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in neonates with reduced renal function (See

                        Serum Concentrations at Steady-State: After multiple doses of theophylline, steady-state is reached in 30-65 hours (average 40 hours) in adults. At steady-state, on a dosage regimen with 24-hour intervals, the expected mean trough concentration is approximately 50% of the mean peak concentration, assuming a mean theophylline half-life of 8 hours. The difference between peak and trough concentrations is larger in patients with more rapid theophylline clearance. In these patients administration of theophylline may be required more frequently (every 12 hours).
