                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Dolutegravir is an HIV-1 antiviral agent [see Microbiology (12.4)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        In a randomized, dose-ranging trial, HIV‑1‑infected subjects treated with dolutegravir monotherapy demonstrated rapid and dose-dependent antiviral activity with mean declines from baseline to Day 11 in HIV-1 RNA of 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 log10 for dolutegravir 2 mg, 10 mg, and 50 mg once daily, respectively. This antiviral response was maintained for 3 to 4 days after the last dose in the 50-mg group.
                        
                           Effects on Electrocardiogram
                        
                        In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, 42 healthy subjects received single-dose oral administrations of placebo, dolutegravir 250-mg suspension (exposures approximately 3–fold of the 50-mg once-daily dose at steady state), and moxifloxacin 400 mg (active control) in random sequence. After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTc change based on Fridericia correction method (QTcF) for dolutegravir was 2.4 msec (1-sided 95% upper CI: 4.9 msec). TIVICAY did not prolong the QTc interval over 24 hours postdose.
                        
                           Effects on Renal Function
                        
                        The effect of dolutegravir on renal function was evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 3‑arm, parallel, placebo-controlled trial in healthy subjects (n = 37) who received dolutegravir 50 mg once daily (n = 12), dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily (n = 13), or placebo once daily (n = 12) for 14 days. A decrease in creatinine clearance, as determined by 24-hour urine collection, was observed with both doses of dolutegravir after 14 days of treatment in subjects who received 50 mg once daily (9% decrease) and 50 mg twice daily (13% decrease). Neither dose of dolutegravir had a significant effect on the actual glomerular filtration rate (determined by the clearance of probe drug, iohexol) or effective renal plasma flow (determined by the clearance of probe drug, para-amino hippurate) compared with the placebo.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetic properties of dolutegravir have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and HIV‑1–infected adult subjects. Exposure to dolutegravir was generally similar between healthy subjects and HIV‑1–infected subjects. The non-linear exposure of dolutegravir following 50 mg twice daily compared with 50 mg once daily in HIV‑1–infected subjects (Table 6) was attributed to the use of metabolic inducers in the background antiretroviral regimens of subjects receiving dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily in clinical trials. TIVICAY was administered without regard to food in these trials.
                        


                        



                           aBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses using data from SPRING-1 and SPRING-2.
                        
                           bBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses using data from VIKING (ING112961) and VIKING-3.
                        
                           Absorption
                        
                        Following oral administration of dolutegravir, peak plasma concentrations were observed 2 to 3 hours postdose. With once-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved within approximately 5 days with average accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmax, and C24 h ranging from 1.2 to 1.5. 
                        Dolutegravir plasma concentrations increased in a less than dose-proportional manner above 50 mg. Dolutegravir is a P‑gp substrate in vitro. The absolute bioavailability of dolutegravir has not been established.
                        
                           Effects of Food on Oral Absorption
                        
                        TIVICAY may be taken with or without food. Food increased the extent of absorption and slowed the rate of absorption of dolutegravir. Low-, moderate-, and high-fat meals increased dolutegravir AUC(0-∞) by 33%, 41%, and 66%; increased Cmax by 46%, 52%, and 67%; and prolonged Tmax to 3, 4, and 5 hours from 2 hours under fasted conditions, respectively.
                        
                           Distribution
                        
                        Dolutegravir is highly bound (greater than or equal to 98.9%) to human plasma proteins based on in vivo data and binding is independent of plasma concentration of dolutegravir. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) following 50-mg once-daily administration is estimated at 17.4 L based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.
                        
                           Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF): In 12 treatment-naïve subjects on dolutegravir 50 mg daily plus abacavir/lamivudine, the median dolutegravir concentration in CSF was 13.2 ng per mL (range: 3.74 ng per mL to 18.3 ng per mL) 2 to 6 hours postdose after 16 weeks of treatment. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been established.
                        
                           Metabolism and Elimination
                        
                        Dolutegravir is primarily metabolized via UGT1A1 with some contribution from CYP3A. After a single oral dose of [14C] dolutegravir, 53% of the total oral dose was excreted unchanged in feces. Thirty-one percent of the total oral dose was excreted in urine, represented by an ether glucuronide of dolutegravir (18.9% of total dose), a metabolite formed by oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose), and its hydrolytic N-dealkylation product (3.6% of total dose). Renal elimination of unchanged drug was low (less than 1% of the dose). 
                        Dolutegravir has a terminal half-life of approximately 14 hours and an apparent clearance (CL/F) of 1.0 L per hour based on population pharmacokinetic analyses.
                        
                           Polymorphisms in Drug‑metabolizing Enzymes: In a meta-analysis of healthy subject trials, subjects with UGT1A1 (n = 7) genotypes conferring poor dolutegravir metabolism had a 32% lower clearance of dolutegravir and 46% higher AUC compared with subjects with genotypes associated with normal metabolism via UGT1A1 (n = 41).
                        
                           Specific Populations
                        
                        
                           Hepatic Impairment: Dolutegravir is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver. In a trial comparing 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score B) with 8 matched healthy controls, exposure of dolutegravir from a single 50-mg dose was similar between the 2 groups. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score A or B). The effect of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C) on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir has not been studied. Therefore, TIVICAY is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
                        
                           HBV/HCV Co-infection: Population analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from adult trials indicated no clinically relevant effect of HCV co-infection on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir. There were limited data on HBV co-infection.
                        
                           Renal Impairment: Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination for dolutegravir. In a trial comparing 8 subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl less than 30 mL per min) with 8 matched healthy controls, AUC, Cmax, and C24 of dolutegravir were decreased by 40%, 23%, and 43%, respectively, compared with those in matched healthy subjects. The cause of this decrease is unknown. Population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from SAILING and VIKING-3 trials indicated that mild and moderate renal impairment had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of dolutegravir. No dosage adjustment is necessary for treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced and INSTI-naïve patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment or for INSTI-experienced patients (with certain INSTI-associated resistance substitutions or clinically suspected INSTI resistance) with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is warranted for INSTI-experienced patients (with certain INSTI-associated resistance substitutions or clinically suspected INSTI resistance [see Microbiology (12.4)]) with severe renal impairment, as the decrease in dolutegravir concentrations may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance to TIVICAY or other coadministered antiretroviral agents. Dolutegravir has not been studied in patients requiring dialysis.
                        
                           Gender: Population analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from adult trials indicated gender had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of dolutegravir.
                        
                           Race: Population analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from adult trials indicated race had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir.
                        
                           Geriatric Patients: Population analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from adult trials indicated age had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir.
                        
                           Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir in HIV‑1–infected children (n = 10) aged 12 to less than 18 years were similar to those observed in HIV‑1–infected adults who received dolutegravir 50 mg once daily (Table 7) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

                           Drug Interactions
                        
                        Drug interaction trials were performed with TIVICAY and other drugs likely to be coadministered or commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions. As dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs dependent on hepatic metabolism (Table 8) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)], the primary focus of these drug interaction trials was to evaluate the effect of coadministered drug on dolutegravir (Table 9).
                        Dosing or regimen recommendations as a result of established and other potentially significant drug-drug interactions with TIVICAY are provided in Table 5 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7.3)].

                           Mechanism of Action
                        
                        Dolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. Strand transfer biochemical assays using purified HIV-1 integrase and pre-processed substrate DNA resulted in IC50 values of 2.7 nM and 12.6 nM.
                        
                           Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture
                        
                        Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 with mean EC50 values of 0.5 nM (0.21 ng per mL) to 2.1 nM (0.85 ng per mL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and MT-4 cells. Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against 13 clinically diverse clade B isolates with a mean EC50 value of 0.52 nM in a viral integrase susceptibility assay using the integrase coding region from clinical isolates. Dolutegravir demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against a panel of HIV-1 clinical isolates (3 in each group of M clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and 3 in group O) with EC50 values ranging from 0.02 nM to 2.14 nM for HIV-1. Dolutegravir EC50 values against 3 HIV-2 clinical isolates in PBMC assays ranged from 0.09 nM to 0.61 nM.
                        
                           Antiviral Activity in Combination with Other Antiviral Agents
                        
                        The antiviral activity of dolutegravir was not antagonistic when combined with the INSTI, raltegravir; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), efavirenz or nevirapine; the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), abacavir or stavudine; the protease inhibitors (PIs), amprenavir or lopinavir; the CCR5 co-receptor antagonist, maraviroc; or the fusion inhibitor, enfuvirtide. Dolutegravir antiviral activity was not antagonistic when combined with the HBV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, adefovir, or inhibited by the antiviral, ribavirin.
                        
                           Resistance
                        
                        
                           Cell Culture: Dolutegravir-resistant viruses were selected in cell culture starting from different wild-type HIV-1 strains and clades. Amino acid substitutions E92Q, G118R, S153F or Y, G193E or R263K emerged in different passages and conferred decreased susceptibility to dolutegravir of up to 4-fold. Passage of mutant viruses containing the Q148R or Q148H substitutions selected for additional substitutions in integrase that conferred decreased susceptibility to dolutegravir (fold-change increase of 13 to 46). The additional integrase substitutions included T97A, E138K, G140S, and M154I. Passage of mutant viruses containing both G140S and Q148H selected for L74M, E92Q, and N155H.
                        
                           Treatment-naïve Subjects: No subjects in the dolutegravir 50-mg once-daily treatment arms of treatment-naïve trials SPRING-2 and SINGLE had a detectable decrease in susceptibility to dolutegravir or background NRTIs in the resistance analysis subset (n = 9) with HIV-1 RNA greater than 400 copies per mL at failure or last visit through Week 96 and having resistance data. One subject in SINGLE with 275 copies per mL HIV-1 RNA had a treatment-emergent integrase substitution (E157Q/P) detected at Week 24, but no corresponding decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility. No treatment-emergent genotypic resistance to the background regimen was observed in the dolutegravir arm in either the SPRING-2 or SINGLE trials. No treatment-emergent primary resistance substitutions were observed in either treatment group in the FLAMINGO trial.
                        
                           Treatment-experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-naïve Subjects: In the dolutegravir arm of the SAILING trial for treatment-experienced and INSTI-naïve subjects (n = 354), treatment-emergent integrase substitutions were observed in 6 of 28 (21%) subjects who had virologic failure and resistance data. In 5 of the 6 subjects’ isolates emergent INSTI substitutions included L74L/M/I, Q95Q/L, V151V/I (n = 1 each), and R263K (n = 2). The change in dolutegravir phenotypic susceptibility for these 5 subject isolates was less than 2-fold. One subject isolate had pre-existing raltegravir resistance substitutions E138A, G140S, and Q148H at baseline and had additional emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions T97A and E138A/T with a corresponding 148-fold reduction in dolutegravir susceptibility at failure. In the comparator raltegravir arm, 21 of 49 (43%) subjects with post-baseline resistance data had evidence of emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions (L74M, E92Q, T97A, E138Q, G140S/A, Y143R/C, Q148H/R, V151I, N155H, E157Q, and G163K/R) and raltegravir phenotypic resistance.
                        
                           Treatment-experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-experienced Subjects: VIKING-3 examined the efficacy of dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily plus optimized background therapy in subjects with prior or current virologic failure on an INSTI- (elvitegravir or raltegravir) containing regimen.
                        In VIKING-4 (ING116529),30 subjects with current virological failure on an INSTI-containing regimen and genotypic evidence of INSTI-resistance substitutions at screening were randomized to receive either dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily or placebo with the current failing regimen for 7 days and then all subjects received open-label dolutegravir plus optimized background regimen from Day 8. Virologic responses at Week 48 by baseline genotypic and phenotypic INSTI-resistance categories and the INSTI resistance-associated substitutions that emerged on dolutegravir treatment in VIKING-4 were consistent with those seen in VIKING-3.
                        
                           Response by Baseline Genotype
                        
                        Of the 183 subjects with baseline data, 30% harbored virus with a substitution at Q148, and 33% had no primary INSTI-resistance substitutions (T66A/I/K, E92Q/V, Y143R/C/H, Q148H/R/K, and N155H) at baseline, but had historical genotypic evidence of INSTI-resistance substitutions, phenotypic evidence of elvitegravir or raltegravir resistance, or genotypic evidence of INSTI-resistance substitutions at screening.
                        Response rates by baseline genotype were analyzed in an “as-treated” analysis at Week 48 (n = 175) (Table 10). The response rate at Week 48 to dolutegravir-containing regimens was 47% (24 of 51) when Q148 substitutions were present at baseline; Q148 was always present with additional INSTI-resistance substitutions (see Table 10). In addition, a diminished virologic response of 40% (6 of 15) was observed when the substitution E157Q or K was present at baseline with other INSTI-resistance substitutions but without a Q148H or R substitution.

                           cThe most common pathway with Q148H/R + greater than or equal to 2 INSTI-resistance substitutions had Q148+G140+E138 substitutions (n = 16).
                        
                           Response by Baseline Phenotype
                        
                        Response rates by baseline phenotype were analyzed in an as-treated analysis using all subjects with available baseline phenotypes through Week 48 (n = 163) (see Table 11). These baseline phenotypic groups are based on subjects enrolled in VIKING-3 and are not meant to represent definitive clinical susceptibility cut points for dolutegravir. The data are provided to guide clinicians on the likelihood of virologic success based on pretreatment susceptibility to dolutegravir in INSTI-resistant patients.

                           Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor Treatment-emergent Resistance
                        
                        There were 50 subjects with virologic failure on the dolutegravir twice-daily regimen in VIKING-3 with HIV-1 RNA greater than 400 copies per mL at the failure timepoint, Week 48 or beyond, or the last timepoint on trial. Thirty-nine subjects with virologic failure had resistance data that were used in the Week 48 analysis. In the Week 48 resistance analysis 85% (33 of 39) of the subjects with virologic failure had treatment-emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions in their isolates. The most common treatment-emergent INSTI-resistance substitution was T97A. Other frequently emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions included L74M, I or V, E138K or A, G140S, Q148H, R or K, M154I, or N155H. Substitutions E92Q, Y143R or C/H, S147G, V151A, and E157E/Q each emerged in 1 to 3 subjects’ isolates. At failure, the median dolutegravir fold-change from reference was 61-fold (range: 0.75 to 209) for isolates with emergent INSTI-resistance substitutions (n = 33). 
                        Resistance to one or more background drugs in the dolutegravir twice-daily regimen also emerged in 49% (19 of 39) subjects in the Week 48 resistance analysis.

                           Site-directed Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-resistant Mutant HIV-1 and HIV-2 Strains: The susceptibility of dolutegravir was tested against 60 INSTI-resistant site-directed mutant HIV-1 viruses (28 with single substitutions and 32 with 2 or more substitutions) and 6 INSTI-resistant site-directed mutant HIV-2 viruses. The single INSTI-resistance substitutions T66K, I151L, and S153Y conferred a greater than 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.3-fold to 3.6-fold from reference). Combinations of multiple substitutions T66K/L74M, E92Q/N155H, G140C/Q148R, G140S/Q148H, R or K, Q148R/N155H, T97A/G140S/Q148, and substitutions at E138/G140/Q148 showed a greater than 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.5-fold to 21-fold from reference). In HIV-2 mutants, combinations of substitutions A153G/N155H/S163G and E92Q/T97A/N155H/S163D conferred 4-fold decreases in dolutegravir susceptibility, and E92Q/N155H and G140S/Q148R showed 8.5-fold and 17-fold decreases in dolutegravir susceptibility, respectively.
                        
                           Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor- and Protease Inhibitor-resistant Strains: Dolutegravir demonstrated equivalent antiviral activity against 2 NNRTI-resistant, 3 NRTI-resistant, and 2 PI-resistant HIV-1 mutant clones compared with the wild-type strain.
