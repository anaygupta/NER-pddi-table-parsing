                  Alcohol produces injury to tissue cells by dehydration and precipitation of protoplasm. When alcohol is injected in close proximity to nerve tissues, it produces neuritis and nerve degeneration (neurolysis). Deliberate injury to selected spinal nerves, peripheral nerves, or ganglia by injection of alcohol results in more or less enduring block of sensory, motor and autonomic function.

                  The injection of alcohol used for therapeutic neurolysis involves amounts too small to produce significant systemic effects of ethanol.

                  Ninety to 98% of ethyl alcohol that enters the body is completely oxidized.
