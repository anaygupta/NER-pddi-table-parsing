                        Ximino is not bioequivalent to immediate release minocycline products.
                        Following administration of a single dose of Ximino (135 mg) to healthy male and female adult subjects, the mean (SD) AUC(0-∞) and Cmax were 12.87 (4.04) mcg x hr/mL and 0.68 (0.25) mcg/mL, respectively, under fasting conditions. 
                        When a single dose of Ximino (135 mg) was administered with a high fat meal to the same subjects in the same study in a crossover design, the mean (SD) AUC(0-∞) and Cmax were 14.16 (3.10) mcg x hr/mL and 0.85 (0.20) mcg/mL, respectively. 
                        A single-dose, crossover study demonstrated that Ximino (45 mg and 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics.
                        Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum.
