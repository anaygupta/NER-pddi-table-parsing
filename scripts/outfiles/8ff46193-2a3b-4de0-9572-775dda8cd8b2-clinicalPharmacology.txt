                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The primary mode of action is thought to be through the osmotic effect of polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid, which causes water to be retained in the colon and produces a watery stool.
