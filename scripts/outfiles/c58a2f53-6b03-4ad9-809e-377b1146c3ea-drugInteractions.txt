                     Alcohol: Verapamil may increase blood 
alcohol concentrations and prolong its effects.
                  
                     Beta-blockers: Controlled studies in small numbers of 
patients suggest that the concomitant use of verapamil hydrochloride and oral 
beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be beneficial in certain patients with 
chronic stable angina or hypertension, but available information is not 
sufficient to predict with confidence the effects of concurrent treatment in 
patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction abnormalities. 
Concomitant therapy with beta-adrenergic blockers and verapamil may result in 
additive negative effects on heart rate, atrioventricular conduction and/or 
cardiac contract contractility.
                  In one study involving 15 patients treated with high doses of propranolol 
(median dose, 480 mg/day; range, 160 to 1,280 mg/day) for severe angina, with 
preserved left ventricular function (ejection fraction greater than 35%), the 
hemodynamic effects of additional therapy with verapamil hydrochloride were 
assessed using invasive methods. The addition of verapamil to high-dose 
beta-blockers induced modest negative inotropic and chronotropic effects that 
were not severe enough to limit short-term (48 hours) combination therapy in 
this study. These modest cardiodepressant effects persisted for greater than 6, 
but less than 30 hours after abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockers and were closely 
related to plasma levels of propranolol. The primary verapamil/beta-blocker 
interaction in this study appeared to be hemodynamic rather than 
electrophysiologic.
                  In other studies verapamil did not generally induce significant negative 
inotropic, chronotropic, or dromotropic effects in patients with preserved left 
ventricular function receiving low or moderate doses of propranolol (less than 
or equal to 320 mg/day); in some patients, however, combined therapy did produce 
such effects. Therefore, if combined therapy is used, close surveillance of 
clinical status should be carried out. Combined therapy should usually be 
avoided in patients with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities and those 
with depressed left ventricular function.
                  Asymptomatic bradycardia (36 beats/min) with a wandering atrial pacemaker has 
been observed in a patient receiving concomitant timolol (a beta-adrenergic 
blocker) eyedrops and oral verapamil.
                  A decrease in metoprolol and propranolol clearance has been observed when 
either drug is administered concomitantly with verapamil. A variable effect has 
been seen when verapamil and atenolol were given together.
                  
                     Digitalis: Clinical use of verapamil in digitalized 
patients has shown the combination to be well tolerated if digoxin doses are 
properly adjusted. However, chronic verapamil treatment can increase serum 
digoxin levels by 50% to 75% during the first week of therapy, and this can 
result in digitalis toxicity. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis the influence 
of verapamil on digitoxin kinetics is magnified. Verapamil may reduce total body 
clearance and extrarenal clearance of digitoxin by 27% and 29% respectively. 
Maintenance and digitalization doses should be reduced when verapamil is 
administered, and the patient should be reassessed to avoid over- or 
underdigitalization. Whenever overdigitalization is suspected, the daily dose of 
digitalis should be reduced or temporary discontinued. On discontinuation of 
verapamil hydrochloride use, the patient should be reassessed to avoid 
underdigitalization.
                  
                     Antihypertensive agents: Verapamil administered 
concomitantly with oral antihypertensive agents (e.g., vasodilators, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, beta-blockers) will usually 
have an additive effect on lowering blood pressure. Patients receiving these 
combinations should be appropriately monitored. Concomitant use of agents that 
attenuate alpha-adrenergic function with verapamil may result in a reduction in 
blood pressure that is excessive in some patients. Such an effect was observed 
in one study following the concomitant administration of verapamil and 
prazosin.
                  
                     Antiarrhythmic agents:
                  
                  
                     
                        Disopyramide:
                      Until data 
on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide are obtained, 
disopyramide should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after 
verapamil administration.
                  
                     Flecainide: A study in healthy volunteers showed that 
the concomitant administration of flecainide and verapamil may have additive 
effects on myocardial contractility, AV conduction, and repolarization. 
Concomitant therapy with flecainide and verapamil may result in additive 
negative inotropic effect and prolongation of atrioventricular conduction.
                  
                     
                        Quinidine:
                      In a small 
number of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (IHSS) concomitant use of 
verapamil and quinidine resulted in significant hypotension. Until further data 
are obtained, combined therapy of verapamil and quinidine in patients with 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should probably be avoided.
                  The electrophysiologic effects of quinidine and verapamil on AV conduction 
were studied in 8 patients. Verapamil significantly counteracted the effects of 
quinidine on AV conduction. There has been a report of increased quinidine 
levels during verapamil therapy.
                  
                     Other:
                  
                  
                     
                        Nitrates: 
                     Verapamil has 
been given concomitantly with short- and long-acting nitrates without any 
undesirable drug interactions. The pharmacologic profile of both drugs and the 
clinical experience suggest beneficial interactions.
                  
                     
                        Cimetidine:
                      The 
interaction between cimetidine and chronically administered verapamil has not 
been studied. Variable results on clearance have been obtained in acute studies 
of healthy volunteers; clearance of verapamil was either reduced of 
unchanged.
                  
                     
                        Lithium:
                      Increased 
sensitivity to the effects of lithium (neurotoxicity) has been reported during 
concomitant verapamil-lithium therapy; lithium levels have been observed 
sometimes to increase, sometimes to decrease, and sometimes to be unchanged. 
Patients receiving both drugs must be monitored carefully.
                  
                     
                        Carbamazepine: 
                     Verapamil 
therapy may increase carbamazepine concentrations during combined therapy. This 
may produce carbamazepine side effects such as diplopia, headache, ataxia, or 
dizziness.
                  
                     
                        Rifampin:
                      Therapy with 
rifampin may markedly reduce oral verapamil bioavailability.
                  
                     
                        Phenobarbital:
                      
Phenobarbital therapy may increase verapamil clearance.
                  
                     
                        Cyclosporin:
                      Verapamil 
therapy may increase serum levels of cyclosporin.
                  
                     
                        Theophylline:
                      Verapamil 
may inhibit the clearance and increase the plasma levels of theophylline.
                  
                     
                        Inhalation anesthetics:
                      
Animal experiments have shown that inhalation anesthetics depress cardiovascular 
activity by decreasing the inward movement of calcium ions. When used 
concomitantly, inhalation anesthetics and calcium antagonists, such as 
verapamil, should each be titrated carefully to avoid excessive cardiovascular 
depression.
                  
                     
                        Neuromuscular blocking 
agents:
                      Clinical data and animal studies suggest that verapamil 
may potentiate the activity of neuromuscular blocking agents (curare-like and 
depolarizing). It may be necessary to decrease the dose of verapamil and/or the 
dose of the neuromuscular blocking agent when the drugs are used 
concomitantly.
                  
                  
                  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
FertilityAn 18-month toxicity study in rats, at a low multiple (6-fold) of 
the maximum recommended human dose, and not the maximum tolerated dose, did not 
suggest a tumorigenic potential. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic 
potential of verapamil administered in the diet of rats for two years at doses 
of 10, 35, and 120 mg/kg/day or approximately 1, 3, 5, and 12 times, 
respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose (480 mg/day or 9.6 
mg/kg/day).
                  Verapamil was not mutagenic in the Ames test in 5 test strains at 3 mg per 
plate with or without metabolic activation.
                  Studies in female rats at daily dietary doses up to 5.5 times (55 mg/kg/day) 
the maximum recommended human dose did not show impaired fertility. Effects on 
male fertility have not been determined.
