                  The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.  Chlorothiazide does not usually affect normal blood pressure.
                  Chlorothiazide affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption.  At maximal therapeutic dosage all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic efficacy.
                  Chlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts.  Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate.
                  After oral use diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.  Following intravenous use of chlorothiazide sodium, onset of the diuretic action occurs in 15 minutes and the maximal action in 30 minutes.

                         Chlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney; 96 percent of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 23 hours.  The plasma half-life of chlorothiazide is 45 to 120 minutes.  Chlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk.
