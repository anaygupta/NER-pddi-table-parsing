                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Thyrotropin (TSH) is a pituitary hormone that
                                    stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone.
                                     Binding of thyrotropin alfa to TSH receptors on normal
                                    thyroid epithelial cells or on well-differentiated thyroid
                                    cancer tissue stimulates iodine uptake and organification, and
                                    synthesis and secretion of thyroglobulin (Tg), triiodothyronine
                                    (T3) and thyroxine (T4).
                        The effect of
                                    thyroid stimulating hormone activation of thyroid cells is to
                                    increase uptake of radioiodine to allow scan detection or
                                    radioiodine killing of thyroid cells.  TSH activation also
                                    leads to the release of thyroglobulin by thyroid cells.
                                     Thyroglobulin functions as a tumor marker which is
                                    detected in blood specimens.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of THYROGEN were studied in 16
                                    patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer given a single
                                    0.9 mg IM dose.  Mean peak serum TSH concentrations of 116
                                    ± 38 mU/L were reached between 3 and 24 hours after
                                    injection (median of 10 hours).  The mean apparent
                                    elimination half-life was 25 ± 10 hours.  The organ(s)
                                    of TSH clearance in man have not been identified, but studies of
                                    pituitary-derived TSH suggest the involvement of the liver and
                                    kidneys.
