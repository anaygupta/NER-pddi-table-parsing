* In clinical trials examining the adjunctive use of REXULTI in the treatment of MDD, dosage was not adjusted for strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine). Thus, CYP considerations are already factored into general dosing recommendations and REXULTI may be administered without dosage adjustment in patients with MDD.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with REXULTI
                     
                        Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment of REXULTI is required when administered concomitantly with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine) or gastric pH modifiers (e.g., omeprazole). Additionally, no dosage adjustment for substrates of CYP2D6 (e.g., dextromethorphan), CYP3A4 (e.g., lovastatin), CYP2B6 (e.g., bupropion), BCRP (e.g., rosuvastatin), or P-gp (e.g., fexofenadine) is required when administered concomitantly with REXULTI.
