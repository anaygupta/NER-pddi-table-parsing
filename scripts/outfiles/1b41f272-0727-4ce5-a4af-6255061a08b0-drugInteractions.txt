                           Aminoglycosides: Increased potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. (7.1)

                           Chloramphenicol: Has been shown to be antagonistic to beta-lactam antibiotics, including ceftazidime. (7.2)

                           Contraceptives: Reduces efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. (7.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Aminoglycosides
                     
                        Renal function should be monitored carefully if high doses of aminoglycosides are to be administered with Ceftazidime for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP because of the increased potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibacterials. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were not noted when ceftazidime was given alone in clinical trials.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Chloramphenicol
                     
                        Chloramphenicol has been shown to be antagonistic to beta-lactam antibacterials, including ceftazidime, based on in vitro studies and time kill curves with enteric gram-negative bacilli. Due to the possibility of antagonism in vivo, particularly when bactericidal activity is desired, this drug combination should be avoided. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Contraceptives
                     
                        In common with other antibacterials, ceftazidime may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.
