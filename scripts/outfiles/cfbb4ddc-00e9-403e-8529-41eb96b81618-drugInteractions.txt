                        Caution should be exercised when concomitantly administering CARDURA XL with a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor. (7.1) 
                        Concomitant administration of CARDURA XL with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension.

                     7.1	CYP 3A4 Inhibitors
                     
                        No in vivo drug interaction studies were conducted with CARDURA XL.
                        
                           In vitro studies suggest that doxazosin is a substrate of CYP 3A4. Caution should be exercised when concomitantly administering CARDURA XL with a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, such as atanazavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole [see

                        Concomitant administration of CARDURA XL with a PDE-5 inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension [see
