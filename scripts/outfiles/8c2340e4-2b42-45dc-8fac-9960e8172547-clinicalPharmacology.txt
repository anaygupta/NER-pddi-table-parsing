                  The most important characteristic of contrast media is the iodine
content. The relatively high atomic weight of iodine contributes sufficient
radiodensity for radiographic contrast with surrounding tissues.
                  Diagnostic enteral radiopaque agents have
few known pharmacological effects. Diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate
sodium exert a mild laxative effect attributable to their high osmolarity.
                  Diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium
are sparingly absorbed from the intact gastrointestinal tract, and
therefore permit gastrointestinal opacification and delineation after
oral or rectal administration. Oral administration is used for radiographic
evaluation of the esophagus, stomach and proximal small intestine.
Rectal administration is used for examination of the colon; however,
visualization of the distal small bowel is generally unsatisfactory,
since the hypertonicity of the medium causes intraluminal diffusion
of water with subsequent dilution of the medium. Enough absorption
from the gastrointestinal tract to permit incidental visualization
of the urinary tract has been reported; this should also be considered
when thyroid testing is being contemplated, since iodine-mediated
thyrotropic effects may occur (see 
                        PRECAUTIONS
                     ).
