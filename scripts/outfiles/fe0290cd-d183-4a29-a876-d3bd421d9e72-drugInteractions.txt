                        Because of possible effects on blood pressure, Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD should be used cautiously with pressor agents.
                        Human pharmacologic studies have shown that methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone), phenylbutazone and some antidepressants (tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Downward dose adjustment of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with methylphenidate. It may be necessary to adjust the dosage and monitor plasma drug concentrations (or, in the case of coumarin, coagulation times), when initiating or discontinuing concomitant methylphenidate.
                        In theory, there is a possibility that the clearance of methylphenidate might be affected by urinary pH, either being increased with acidifying agents or decreased with alkalizing agents.  This should be considered when methylphenidate is given in combination with agents that alter urinary pH.

                              There is a risk of sudden blood pressure increase during surgery.  If surgery is planned, Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD should not be taken the day of the surgery.
