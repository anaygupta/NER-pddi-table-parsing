                           Leuprolide Acetate for Depot Suspension
                        
                        No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate for depot suspension. However, drug interactions associated with cytochrome P-450 enzymes or protein binding would not be expected to occur [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                           Norethindrone Acetate
                        
                        No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies investigating any drug-drug interactions with norethindrone acetate have been conducted. Drugs or herbal products that induce or inhibit certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease or increase the serum concentrations of norethindrone.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions
                     
                        
                           Leuprolide Acetate for Depot Suspension
                        
                        Administration of leuprolide acetate for depot suspension in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within three months after treatment is discontinued. Therefore, diagnostic tests of pituitary gonadotropic and gonadal functions conducted during treatment and for up to three months after discontinuation of leuprolide acetate for depot suspension may be  affected.
