                        Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids: Enhancement of pharmacodynamic effects. Reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection or the concomitant medication may be required.

                        Coadministration of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when coadministered with dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection, a reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection or the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Neuromuscular Blockers
                     
                        In one study of ten healthy adult volunteers, administration of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of one ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration.
