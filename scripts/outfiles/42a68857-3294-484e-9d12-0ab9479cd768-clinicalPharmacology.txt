effects by binding at stereo specific receptors at several sites within the 
central nervous system. Their exact mechanism of action is unknown. Clinically, 
all benzodiazepines cause a dose-related central nervous system depressant 
activity varying from mild impairment of task performance to hypnosis.
                  Following oral administration, alprazolam is readily absorbed. Peak 
concentrations in the plasma occur in one to two hours following administration. 
Plasma levels are proportionate to the dose given; over the dose range of 0.5 to 
3 mg, peak levels of 8.0 to 37 ng/mL were observed. Using a specific assay 
methodology, the mean plasma elimination half-life of alprazolam has been found 
to be about 11.2 hours (range: 6.3 to 26.9 hours) in healthy adults.
                  The predominant metabolites are α-hydroxy-alprazolam and a benzophenone 
derived from alprazolam. The biological activity of α-hydroxy-alprazolam is 
approximately one-half that of alprazolam. The benzophenone metabolite is 
essentially inactive. Plasma levels of these metabolites are extremely low, thus 
precluding precise pharmacokinetic description. However, their half-lives appear 
to be of the same order of magnitude as that of alprazolam. Alprazolam and its 
metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine.
                  The ability of alprazolam to induce human hepatic enzyme systems has not yet 
been determined. However, this is not a property of benzodiazepines in general. 
Further, alprazolam did not affect the prothrombin or plasma warfarin levels in 
male volunteers administered sodium warfarin orally.
                  
                     In vitro, alprazolam is bound (80 percent) to 
human serum protein.
                  Changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of 
benzodiazepines have been reported in a variety of disease states including 
alcoholism, impaired hepatic function and impaired renal function. Changes have 
also been demonstrated in geriatric patients. A mean half-life of alprazolam of 
16.3 hours has been observed in healthy elderly subjects (range: 9.0 to 26.9 
hours, n = 16) compared to 11.0 hours (range: 6.3 to 15.8 hours, n = 16) in 
healthy adult subjects. In patients with alcoholic liver disease the half-life 
of alprazolam ranged between 5.8 and 65.3 hours (mean: 19.7 hours, n = 17) as 
compared to between 6.3 and 26.9 hours (mean = 11.4 hours, n = 17) in healthy 
subjects. In an obese group of subjects the half-life of alprazolam ranged 
between 9.9 and 40.4 hours (mean = 21.8 hours, n = 12) as compared to between 
6.3 and 15.8 hours (mean = 10.6 hours, n = 12) in healthy subjects.
                  Because of its similarity to other benzodiazepines, it is assumed that 
alprazolam undergoes transplacental passage and that it is excreted in human 
milk
