Drug Interactions
(See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.)PRECAUTIONS, Methadone undergoes hepatic N-demethylation by cytochrome P-450 isoforms, principally CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. Coadministration of methadone with inducers of these enzymes may result in more rapid methadone metabolism, and potentially, decreased effects of methadone. Conversely, administration with inhibitors may reduce metabolism and potentiate methadoneâ€™s effects. Therefore, drugs administered concomitantly with methadone should be evaluated for interaction potential. Clinicians are advised to evaluate individual response to drug therapy.
