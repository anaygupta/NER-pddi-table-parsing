                  Barium sulfate, due to its high
molecular density is opaque to x-rays and therefore acts as a positive
contrast agent for radiographic studies. Barium sulfate is biologically
inert and therefore is not absorbed or metabolized by the body, and
is eliminated unchanged from the body.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Absorption
and Metabolism
                     
                        E-Z-DISK tablets
disintegrate within 30 minutes after ingestion, and the fragments
are eliminated with the feces without absorption of the barium sulfate.
A brief delay in transit may sometimes be seen in elderly patients,
particularly above the hiatus, or at the level of the aortic arch.
In such instances, a sip of water is sufficient to carry the tablet
down the esophagus.
