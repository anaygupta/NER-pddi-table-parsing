                        Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with this drug may exhibit an additive CNS depression. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. The concurrent use of anticholinergics with codeine may produce paralytic ileus. MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines. Antihistamines may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g.; hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
