                        Acute pulmonary reactions have been reported with Vinorelbine Injection USP and other anticancer vinca alkaloids used in conjunction with mitomycin. Although the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine are not influenced by the concurrent administration of cisplatin, the incidence of granulocytopenia with Vinorelbine Injection USP used in combination with cisplatin is significantly higher than with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP. Patients who receive Vinorelbine Injection USP and paclitaxel, either concomitantly or sequentially should be monitored for signs and symptoms of neuropathy. Administration of Vinorelbine Injection USP to patients with prior or concomitant radiation therapy may result in radio sensitizing effects.
                        Caution should be exercised in patients concurrently taking drugs known to inhibit drug metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily, or in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of vinorelbine tartrate with an inhibitor of this metabolic pathway may cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of side effects.
