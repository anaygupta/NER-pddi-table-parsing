                  Local anesthetics block the generation and the conduction of                             nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical                             excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve                             impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential.  In                             general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter,                             myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers.                              Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows:                             (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5)                             skeletal muscle tone.
                  Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the                             cardiovascular and central nervous systems (CNS).  At blood                             concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in                             cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and                             peripheral vascular resistance are minimal.  However, toxic                             blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which                             may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac                             arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities.  In addition,                             myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation                             occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure.                              Recent clinical reports and animal research suggest that these                             cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended direct                             intravascular injection of bupivacaine.  Therefore, when                             epidural anesthesia with bupivacaine is considered, incremental dosing                             is necessary.
                  Following systemic absorption, local anesthetics can produce                             central nervous system stimulation, depression, or both.                              Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness,                             tremors and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by                             depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest.                              However, the local anesthetics have a primary depressant                             effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed                             stage may occur without a prior excited stage.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The rate of systemic absorption of local anesthetics is                                     dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug                                     administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of                                     the administration site, and the presence or absence of                                     epinephrine in the anesthetic solution.  A dilute concentration                                     of epinephrine (1:200,000 or 5 mcg/mL) usually reduces the rate                                     of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine,                                     permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and                                     sometimes prolonging the duration of action.
                        The onset of action with Sensorcaine is rapid and                                     anesthesia is long lasting.  The duration of anesthesia                                     is significantly longer with Sensorcaine than with any other                                     commonly used local anesthetic.  It has also been noted                                     that there is a period of analgesia that persists after the                                     return of sensation, during which time the need for strong                                     analgesics is reduced.
                        The onset of sensory blockade following spinal block with                                     Sensorcaine-MPF Spinal Injection is very rapid (within one                                     minute); maximum motor blockade and maximum dermatome level are                                     achieved within 15 minutes in most cases.  Duration of                                     sensory blockade (time to return of complete sensation in the                                     operative site or regression of two dermatomes) following a 12                                     mg dose averages 2 hours with or without 0.2 mg epinephrine.                                      The time to return of complete motor ability with 12                                     mg Sensorcaine-MPF Spinal averages 3½ hours without the                                     addition of epinephrine and 4½ hours if 0.2 mg                                     epinephrine is added.  When compared to equal milligram                                     doses of hyperbaric tetracaine, the duration of sensory blockade                                     was the same but the time to complete motor recovery was                                     significantly longer for tetracaine.  Addition of 0.2                                     mg epinephrine significantly prolongs the motor blockade and                                     time to first postoperative narcotic with Sensorcaine-MPF Spinal                                     Injection.
                        Local anesthetics appear to cross the placenta by passive                                     diffusion.  The rate and degree of diffusion is                                     governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the                                     degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility.                                      Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to                                     be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding,                                     because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental                                     transfer.  Sensorcaine with a high protein binding                                     capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to                                     0.4).  The extent of placental transfer is also                                     determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of                                     the drug.  Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily                                     enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation.
                        Depending upon the route of administration, local                                     anesthetics are distributed to some extent to all body tissues,                                     with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as                                     the liver, lungs, heart, and brain.
                        Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profiles of                                     Sensorcaine after direct intravenous injection suggest a                                     three-compartment open model.  The first compartment is                                     represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug.                                      The second compartment represents the equilibration of                                     the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the                                     brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys and liver.  The third                                     compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly                                     perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat.  The                                     elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely                                     upon the ability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it                                     to the liver where it is metabolized.
                        Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local                                     anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of                                     hepatic or renal disease, addition of epinephrine, factors                                     affecting urinary pH, renal blood flow, the route of drug                                     administration, and the age of the patient.  The                                     half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours and in neonates                                     8.1 hours.  In clinical studies, elderly patients exhibited a                                     greater spread and higher maximal level of analgesia than                                     younger patients.  Elderly patients also reached the                                     maximal level of analgesia more rapidly than younger patients,                                     and exhibited a faster onset of motor blockade.  The                                     total plasma clearance was decreased and the terminal half-life                                     was lengthened in these patients.
                        Amide-type local anesthetics such as Sensorcaine are                                     metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with                                     glucuronic acid.  Patients with hepatic disease,                                     especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more                                     susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local                                     anesthetics.  Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite                                     of bupivacaine.
                        The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local                                     anesthetics and their metabolites.  Urinary excretion                                     is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary                                     pH.  Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted                                     unchanged in the urine.
                        When administered in recommended doses and                                     concentrations, Sensorcaine does not ordinarily produce                                     irritation or tissue damage and does not cause                                     methemoglobinemia.
