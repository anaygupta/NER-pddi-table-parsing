                        ATROVENT HFA Inhalation Aerosol has been used concomitantly with other drugs, including sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, oral and inhaled steroids, that may be used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. With the exception of albuterol, there are no formal studies fully evaluating the interaction effects of ATROVENT and these drugs with respect to effectiveness.
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Anticholinergic agents
                                 : There is potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications.  Caution is therefore advised in the co-administration of ATROVENT HFA Inhalation Aerosol with other anticholinergic-containing drugs.
