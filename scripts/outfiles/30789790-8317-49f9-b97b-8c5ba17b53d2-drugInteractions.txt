                        Interactions between INTRON A and other drugs have not been fully evaluated.  Caution should be exercised when administering INTRON A therapy in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents such as zidovudine.  Concomitant use of alpha interferon and theophylline decreases theophylline clearance, resulting in a 100% increase in serum theophylline levels.
