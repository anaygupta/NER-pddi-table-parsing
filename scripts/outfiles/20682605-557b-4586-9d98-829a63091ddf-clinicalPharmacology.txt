                  Airway inflammation is known to be an important component in the 
pathogenesis of asthma. Inflammation occurs in both large and small airways. 
Corticosteroids have multiple anti-inflammatory effects, inhibiting both 
inflammatory cells (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, 
macrophages, and neutrophils) and release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., 
histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines). These anti-inflammatory 
actions of corticosteroids such as beclomethasone dipropionate contribute to 
their efficacy in asthma. 
                  Beclomethasone dipropionate is a prodrug that is rapidly activated by 
hydrolysis to the active monoester, 17 monopropionate (17-BMP). Beclomethasone 
17 monopropionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit 
a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately 
13 times that of dexamethasone, 6 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 1.5 
times that of budesonide and 25 times that of beclomethasone dipropionate. The 
clinical significance of these findings is unknown.
                  Studies in patients with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical 
anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended 
doses of QVAR.
                  
                  PharmacokineticsBeclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) undergoes rapid and extensive 
conversion to beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (17-BMP) during absorption. The 
pharmacokinetics of 17-BMP has been studied in asthmatics given single 
doses.
                  
                  AbsorptionThe mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) 
of BDP was 88 pg/ml at 0.5 hour after inhalation of 320 mcg using QVAR (four 
actuations of the 80 mcg/actuation strength). The mean peak plasma concentration 
of the major and most active metabolite, 17-BMP, was 1419 pg/ml at 0.7 hour 
after inhalation of 320 mcg of QVAR. When the same nominal dose is provided by 
the two QVAR strengths (40 and 80 mcg/actuation), equivalent systemic 
pharmacokinetics can be expected. The Cmax of 17-BMP 
increased dose proportionally in the dose range of 80 and 320 mcg.
                  
                  MetabolismThree major metabolites are formed via cytochrome P450 3A 
catalyzed biotransformation - beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (17-BMP), 
beclomethasone-21-monopropionate (21-BMP) and beclomethasone (BOH). Lung slices 
metabolize BDP rapidly to 17-BMP and more slowly to BOH. 17-BMP is the most 
active metabolite.
                  
                  DistributionThe in vitro protein binding for 
17-BMP was reported to be 94-96% over the concentration range of 1000 to 5000 
pg/mL. Protein binding was constant over the concentration range evaluated. 
There is no evidence of tissue storage of BDP or its metabolites.
                  
                  EliminationThe major route of elimination of inhaled BDP appears to be via 
hydrolysis. More than 90% of inhaled BDP is found as 17-BMP in the systemic 
circulation. The mean elimination half-life of 17-BMP is 2.8 hours. Irrespective 
of the route of administration (injection, oral or inhalation), BDP and its 
metabolites are mainly excreted in the feces. Less than 10% of the drug and its 
metabolites are excreted in the urine.
                  
                  Special PopulationsFormal pharmacokinetic studies using QVAR were not conducted in 
any special populations.
                  
                  PediatricsThe pharmacokinetics of 17-BMP, including dose and strength 
proportionalities, is similar in children and adults, although the exposure is 
highly variable. In 17 children (mean age 10 years), the Cmax of 17-BMP was 787 pg/ml at 0.6 hour after inhalation of 160 
mcg (four actuations of the 40 mcg/actuation strength of HFA beclomethasone 
dipropionate). The systemic exposure to 17-BMP from 160 mcg of HFA-BDP 
administered without a spacer was comparable to the systemic exposure to 17-BMP 
from 336 mcg CFC-BDP administered with a large volume spacer in 14 children 
(mean age 12 years). This implies that approximately twice the systemic exposure 
to 17-BMP would be expected for comparable mg doses of HFA-BDP without a spacer 
and CFC-BDP with a large volume spacer.
                  
                  PharmacodynamicsImprovement in asthma control following inhalation can occur 
within 24 hours of beginning treatment in some patients, although maximum 
benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks, or longer. The effects of QVAR on 
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were studied in 40 corticosteroid 
naive patients. QVAR, at doses of 80, 160 or 320 mcg twice daily was compared 
with placebo and 336 mcg twice daily of beclomethasone dipropionate in a CFC 
propellant based formulation (CFC-BDP). Active treatment groups showed an 
expected dose-related reduction in 24-hour urinary free cortisol (a sensitive 
marker of adrenal production of cortisol). Patients treated with the highest 
recommended dose of QVAR (320 mcg twice daily) had a 37.3% reduction in 24-hour 
urinary free cortisol compared to a reduction of 47.3% produced by treatment 
with 336 mcg twice daily of CFC-BDP. There was a 12.2% reduction in 24 hour 
urinary free cortisol seen in the group of patients that received 80 mcg twice 
daily of QVAR and a 24.6% reduction in the group of patients that received 160 
mcg twice daily. An open label study of 354 asthma patients given QVAR at 
recommended doses for one year assessed the effect of QVAR treatment on the HPA 
axis (as measured by both morning and stimulated plasma cortisol). Less than 1% 
of patients treated for one year with QVAR had an abnormal response (peak less 
than 18 mcg/dL) to short-cosyntropin test.
