                     7.1 Alcohol, Sedative Hypnotics, and CNS Depressants
                     
                        Xyrem should not be used in combination with alcohol or sedative hypnotics.  Use of other CNS depressants may potentiate the CNS-depressant effects of Xyrem.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Divalproex Sodium
                     
                        Concomitant use of Xyrem with divalproex sodium resulted in a 25% mean increase in systemic exposure to Xyrem (AUC ratio range of 0.8 to 1.7) and in a greater impairment on some tests of attention and working memory. An initial Xyrem dose reduction of at least 20% is recommended if divalproex sodium is prescribed to patients already taking Xyrem [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  Prescribers are advised to monitor patient response closely and adjust dose accordingly if concomitant use of Xyrem and divalproex sodium is warranted.
