                     Mechanism of Action:

                     
                        The therapeutic action of talc instilled into the pleural cavity is thought to result from induction of an inflammatory reaction.  This reaction promotes adherence of the visceral to the parietal pleura, obliterating the pleural space and preventing reaccumulation of pleural fluid.  The extent of talc systemically absorbed after intrapleural administration has not been adequately studied.  Systemic exposure could be affected by the integrity of the visceral pleura, and therefore could be increased if talc is administered immediately following lung resection or biopsy.
