                     In vitro studies indicate that topiramate does not inhibit enzyme activity for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 isozymes. In vitro studies indicate that topiramate is a mild inhibitor of CYP2C19 and a mild inducer of CYP3A4. Drug interactions with some antiepileptic drugs, CNS depressants and oral contraceptives are described here. For other drug interactions, please refer to Clinical Pharmacology (12.5).

                           Concomitant administration of valproic acid and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy. (5.7) 
                           Oral Contraceptives: Decreased contraceptive efficacy and increased breakthrough bleeding should be considered, especially at doses greater than 200 mg/day. (7.3) 
                           Metformin is contraindicated with metabolic acidosis, a possible effect of topiramate. (7.4) 
                           Lithium levels should be monitored when coadministered with high-dose topiramate. (7.5) 
                           Other Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors: Monitor the patient for the appearance or worsening of metabolic acidosis. (7.6) 
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Antiepileptic Drugs
                     
                        Potential interactions between topiramate and standard AEDs were assessed in controlled clinical pharmacokinetic studies in patients with epilepsy. Concomitant administration of phenytoin or carbamazepine with topiramate decreased plasma concentrations of topiramate by 48% and 40% respectively when compared to topiramate given alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. In addition, concomitant administration of valproic acid and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)

                     7.2 CNS Depressants
                     
                        Concomitant administration of topiramate and alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Because of the potential of topiramate to cause CNS depression, as well as other cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric adverse events, topiramate should be used with extreme caution if used in combination with alcohol and other CNS depressants. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Oral Contraceptives
                     
                        Exposure to ethinyl estradiol was statistically significantly decreased at doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg/day (18%, 21% and 30%, respectively) when topiramate was given as adjunctive therapy in patients taking valproic acid. However, norethindrone exposure was not significantly affected. In another pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers with a concomitantly administered combination oral contraceptive product containing 1 mg norethindrone (NET) plus 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE), topiramate, given in the absence of other medications at doses of 50 to 200 mg/day, was not associated with statistically significant changes in mean exposure (AUC) to either component of the oral contraceptive. The possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy and increased breakthrough bleeding should be considered in patients taking combination oral contraceptive products with topiramate. Patients taking estrogen-containing contraceptives should be asked to report any change in their bleeding patterns. Contraceptive efficacy can be decreased even in the absence of breakthrough bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Metformin
                     
                        Topiramate treatment can frequently cause metabolic acidosis, a condition for which the use of metformin is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Lithium
                     
                        In patients, lithium levels were unaffected during treatment with topiramate at doses of 200 mg/day; however, there was an observed increase in systemic exposure of lithium (27% for Cmax and 26% for AUC) following topiramate doses of up to 600 mg/day. Lithium levels should be monitored when coadministered with high-dose topiramate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6 Other Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors
                     
                        Concomitant use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with any other carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide), may increase the severity of metabolic acidosis and may also increase the risk of kidney stone formation. Therefore, if topiramate is given concomitantly with another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, the patient should be monitored for the appearance or worsening of metabolic acidosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].
