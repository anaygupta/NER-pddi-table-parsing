                  Cholesterol is probably the sole precursor of bile acids.  During normal digestion, bile acids are secreted into the intestines.  A major portion of the bile acids is absorbed from the intestinal tract and returned to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation.  Only very small amounts of bile acids are found in normal serum.
                  Cholestyramine resin adsorbs and combines with the bile acids in the intestine to form an insoluble complex which is excreted in the feces.  This results in a partial removal of bile acids from the enterohepatic circulation by preventing their absorption.
                  The increased fecal loss of bile acids due to cholestyramine resin administration leads to an increased oxidation of cholesterol to bile acids, a decrease in beta lipoprotein or low density lipoprotein plasma levels and a decrease in serum cholesterol levels.  Although in man, cholestyramine resin produces an increase in hepatic synthesis of cholesterol, plasma cholesterol levels fall.
                  In patients with partial biliary obstruction, the reduction of serum bile acid levels by cholestyramine resin reduces excess bile acids deposited in the dermal tissue with resultant decrease in pruritus.
