                           Acidifying and Alkalinizing Agents:  Agents that alter urinary pH can alter blood levels of amphetamine.  Acidifying agents decrease amphetamine blood levels, while alkalinizing agents increase amphetamine blood levels.  Adjust VYVANSE dosage accordingly (2.6, 7.1)

                     7.2	Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with VYVANSE
                     
                        From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment of VYVANSE is necessary when VYVANSE is co-administered with guanfacine, venlafaxine, or omeprazole. In addition, no dose adjustment of guanfacine or venlafaxine is needed when VYVANSE is co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment for drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, duloxetine, melatonin), CYP2D6 (e.g. atomoxetine, desipramine, venlafaxine), CYP2C19 (e.g. omeprazole, lansoprazole, clobazam), and CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, pimozide, simvastatin) is necessary when VYVANSE is co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
