                  Mechanism of ActionFexofenadine hydrochloride, the major active metabolite of 
terfenadine, is an antihistamine with selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist activity. Both enantiomers of 
fexofenadine hydrochloride displayed approximately equipotent antihistaminic 
effects. Fexofenadine hydrochloride inhibited antigen-induced bronchospasm in 
sensitized guinea pigs and histamine release from peritoneal mast cells in rats. 
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. In laboratory animals, 
no anticholinergic or alpha1-adrenergic blocking effects 
were observed. Moreover, no sedative or other central nervous system effects 
were observed. Radiolabeled tissue distribution studies in rats indicated that 
fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier. 
                  
                  PharmacokineticsThe pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine hydrochloride in subjects 
with seasonal allergic rhinitis and subjects with chronic urticaria were similar 
to those in healthy volunteers.
                  
                  AbsorptionFexofenadine hydrochloride was rapidly absorbed following oral 
administration of a single dose of two 60 mg capsules to healthy male volunteers 
with a mean time to maximum plasma concentration occurring at 2.6 hours 
post-dose. After administration of a single 60 mg capsule to healthy volunteers, 
the mean maximum plasma concentration was 131 ng/mL. Following single dose oral 
administrations of either the 60 and 180 mg tablet to healthy adult male 
volunteers, mean maximum plasma concentrations were 142 and 494 ng/mL, 
respectively. The tablet formulations are bioequivalent to the capsule when 
administered at equal doses. Fexofenadine hydrochloride pharmacokinetics are 
linear for oral doses up to a total daily dose of 240 mg (120 mg twice daily). 
The administration of the 60 mg capsule contents mixed with applesauce did not 
have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine in adults.
                  Co-administration of 180 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride tablet with a high fat 
meal decreased the AUC and Cmax of fexofenadine by 21 and 20% respectively.  

                  
                  DistributionFexofenadine hydrochloride is 60% to 70% bound to plasma 
proteins, primarily albumin and α1-acid 
glycoprotein.
                  
                  MetabolismApproximately 5% of the total dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride 
was eliminated by hepatic metabolism.
                  
                  EliminationThe mean elimination half-life of fexofenadine was 14.4 hours 
following administration of 60mg, twice daily, in healthy volunteers.
                  Human mass balance studies documented a recovery of approximately 80% and 11% 
of the [14C] fexofenadine hydrochloride dose in the feces 
and urine, respectively. Because the absolute bioavailability of fexofenadine 
hydrochloride has not been established, it is unknown if the fecal component 
represents primarily unabsorbed drug or the result of biliary excretion.
                  
                  Special PopulationsPharmacokinetics in special populations (for renal, hepatic 
impairment, and age), obtained after a single dose of 80 mg fexofenadine 
hydrochloride, were compared to those from healthy volunteers in a separate 
study of similar design.
                  
                  Geriatric SubjectsIn older subjects (greater than or equal to 65 years old), peak plasma levels of 
fexofenadine were 99% greater than those observed in younger subjects less than 65 
years old). Mean fexofenadine elimination half-lives were similar to those 
observed in younger subjects.
                  
                  Pediatric SubjectsCross study comparisons indicated that fexofenadine area under 
the curve (AUC) following oral administration of a 60 mg dose of fexofenadine 
hydrochloride to 7–12 year old pediatric subjects with allergic rhinitis was 56% 
greater compared to healthy adult volunteers given the same dose. Plasma 
exposure in pediatric subjects given 30 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride is 
comparable to adults given 60 mg.
                  
                  Renally ImpairedIn subjects with mild to moderate (creatinine clearance 41–80 
mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 11–40 mL/min) renal impairment, peak 
plasma levels of fexofenadine were 87% and 111% greater, respectively, and mean 
elimination half-lives were 59% and 72% longer, respectively, than observed in 
healthy volunteers. Peak plasma levels in subjects on dialysis (creatinine 
clearance ≤10 mL/min) were 82% greater and half-life was 31% longer than 
observed in healthy volunteers. Based on increases in bioavailability and 
half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in 
patients with decreased renal function. (See DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION).
                  
                  Hepatically ImpairedThe pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine in subjects with hepatic 
disease did not differ substantially from that observed in healthy 
volunteers.
                  
                  Effect of GenderAcross several trials, no clinically significant gender-related 
differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine 
hydrochloride.
                  
                  
                  Pharmacodynamics
                  Wheal and FlareHuman histamine skin wheal and flare studies following single and 
twice daily doses of 20 and 40 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride demonstrated that 
the drug exhibits an antihistamine effect by 1 hour, achieves maximum effect at 
2 to 3 hours, and an effect is still seen at 12 hours. There was no evidence of 
tolerance to these effects after 28 days of dosing. The clinical significance of 
these observations is unknown. 
                  Histamine skin wheal and flare studies in 7 to 12 year old subjects showed 
that following a single dose of 30 or 60 mg, antihistamine effect was observed 
at 1 hour and reached a maximum by 3 hours. Greater than 49% inhibition of wheal 
area, and 74% inhibition of flare area were maintained for 8 hours following the 
30 and 60 mg dose.
                  
                  Effects on QTc
                  In dogs (30 mg/kg/orally twice daily for 5 days) and rabbits (10 
mg/kg,  intravenously over 1 hour), fexofenadine hydrochloride did not prolong 
QTc. In dogs, the plasma fexofenadine concentration was 
approximately 9 times the therapeutic plasma concentrations in adults receiving 
the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of 180 mg. In rabbits, the plasma 
fexofenadine concentration was approximately 20 times the therapeutic plasma 
concentration in adults receiving the maximum recommended human daily oral dose 
of 180 mg. No effect was observed on calcium channel current, delayed K+ channel current, or action potential duration in guinea pig 
myocytes, Na+ current in rat neonatal myocytes, or on the 
delayed rectifier K+ channel cloned from human heart at 
concentrations up to 1 × 10-5 M of fexofenadine.
                  No statistically significant increase in mean QTc 
interval compared to placebo was observed in 714 subjects with seasonal allergic 
rhinitis given fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules in doses of 60 to 240 mg 
twice daily for 2 weeks. Pediatric subjects from 2 placebo- controlled trials 
(n=855) treated with up to 60 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride twice daily 
demonstrated no significant treatment- or dose-related increases in QTc. In addition, no statistically significant increase in mean 
QTc interval compared to placebo was observed in 40 
healthy volunteers given fexofenadine hydrochloride as an oral solution at doses 
up to 400 mg twice daily for 6 days, or in 230 healthy volunteers given 
fexofenadine hydrochloride 240 mg once daily for 1 year. In subjects with 
chronic idiopathic urticaria, there were no clinically relevant differences for 
any ECG intervals, including QTc, between those treated 
with fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg once daily (n = 163) and those treated 
with placebo (n = 91) for 4 weeks.
