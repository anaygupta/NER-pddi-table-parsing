                              Reversible decreases in steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations and renal glycoside excretion were observed in patients receiving beta-acetyldigoxin and chemotherapy regimens containing cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone with or without cytarabine or procarbazine. Steady-state plasma digitoxin concentrations did not appear to change. Therefore, monitoring of plasma digoxin levels may be indicated in patients receiving similar combination chemotherapy regimens. The utilization of digitoxin for such patients may be considered as an alternative.

                              in vitro
                            interaction study between gentamicin and cytarabine showed a cytarabine related antagonism for the susceptibility of 
                              K. pneumoniae
                            strains. This study suggests that in patients on cytarabine being treated with gentamicin for a 
                              K. pneumoniae
                            infection, the lack of a prompt therapeutic response may indicate the need for reevaluation of antibacterial therapy. 
                        Clinical evidence in one patient showed possible inhibition of fluorocytosine efficacy during therapy with cytarabine. This may be due to potential competitive inhibition of its uptake.
