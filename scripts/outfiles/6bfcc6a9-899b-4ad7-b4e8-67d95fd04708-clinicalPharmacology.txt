                  Topical application of hydroquinones produce a reversible depigmentation of the skin by the inhibition of the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine to 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) [Denton, C., et al , 1952 (1)] and suppression of other melanocyte metabolic processes [Jimbow, K., et al, 1974 (2)]. Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light will cause repigmentation of the bleached areas [Parrish, J., et al, 1978 (3)].
