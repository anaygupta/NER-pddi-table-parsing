                        Formal studies designed to evaluate drug interactions with calcitonin-salmon have not been done. No drug interaction studies have been performed with Calcitonin Salmon Nasal Solution ingredients.
                        Concomitant use of calcitonin and lithium may lead to a reduction in plasma lithium concentrations due to increased urinary clearance of lithium.  The dose of lithium may need to be adjusted.
                        The effects of prior use of diphosphonates in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients have not been assessed; however, in patients with Pagetâ€™s disease, prior diphosphonate use appears to reduce the anti-resorptive response to Calcitonin Salmon Nasal Solution .
