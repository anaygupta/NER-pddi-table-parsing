                  Slushed solution is used to induce regional hypothermia in conditions such as certain open heart and kidney surgical procedures by direct application of slushed solution. The objective of regional hypothermia is to reduce cellular metabolic activity so that body tissues can tolerate a period of total or relative ischemia thereby inhibiting the formation and buildup of destructive autolytic enzymes and anaerobic by-products usually produced and accumulated in ischemic tissues.
