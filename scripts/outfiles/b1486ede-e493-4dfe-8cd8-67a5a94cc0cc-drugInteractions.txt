                        The risk of using bromocriptine in combination with other drugs has not been systematically evaluated, but alcohol may potentiate the side effects of bromocriptine. Bromocriptine may interact with dopamine antagonists, butyrophenones, and certain other agents. Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of bromocriptine: phenothiazines, haloperidol, metoclopramide, pimozide. Concomitant use of bromocriptine with other ergot alkaloids is not recommended.
