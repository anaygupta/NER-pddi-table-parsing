                  Drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects showed no pharmacokinetic interactions between VIMPAT and carbamazepine, valproate, digoxin, metformin, omeprazole, or an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. There was no evidence for any relevant drug-drug interaction of VIMPAT with common AEDs in the placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with partial-onset seizures [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                     ].
                  The lack of pharmacokinetic interaction does not rule out the possibility of pharmacodynamic interactions, particularly among drugs that affect the heart conduction system.
