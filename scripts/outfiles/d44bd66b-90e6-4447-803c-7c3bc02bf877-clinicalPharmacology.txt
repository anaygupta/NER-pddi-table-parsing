                     Mechanism of Action: 
                     
                        The precise mechanism(s) by which lamotrigine exerts its anticonvulsant action are unknown. In animal models designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, lamotrigine was effective in preventing seizure spread in the maximum electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazol (scMet) tests, and prevented seizures in the visually and electrically evoked after-discharge (EEAD) tests for antiepileptic activity. Lamotrigine also displayed inhibitory properties in the kindling model in rats both during kindling development and in the fully kindled state.The relevance of these models to human epilepsy, however, is not known. 
                        One proposed mechanism of action of lamotrigine, the relevance of which remains to be established in humans, involves an effect on sodium channels. In vitro pharmacological studies suggest that lamotrigine inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thereby stabilizing neuronal membranes and consequently modulating presynaptic transmitter release of excitatory amino acids (e.g., glutamate and aspartate). The mechanisms by which lamotrigine exerts its therapeutic action in Bipolar Disorder have not been established.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacological Properties:
                     
                        Although the relevance for human use is unknown, the following data characterize the performance of lamotrigine in receptor binding assays. Lamotrigine had a weak inhibitory effect on the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor (IC50 = 18 µM). It does not exhibit high affinity binding (IC50 > 100 µM) to the following neurotransmitter receptors: adenosine A1 and A2; adrenergic ɑ1, ɑ2, and Β; dopamine D1 and D2; ɣ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A and B; histamine H1; kappa opioid; muscarinic acetylcholine; and serotonin 5-HT2. Studies have failed to detect an effect of lamotrigine on dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels. It had weak effects at sigma opioid receptors (IC50 = 145 µM). Lamotrigine did not inhibit the uptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, or serotonin (IC50 > 200 µM) when tested in rat synaptosomes and/or human platelets in vitro.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Effect of Lamotrigine on N-Methyl d-Aspartate-Receptor Mediated Activity: 
                           
                              Lamotrigine did not inhibit N-methyl daspartate (NMDA)-induced depolarizations in rat cortical slices or NMDA-induced cyclic GMP formation in immature rat cerebellum, nor did lamotrigine displace compounds that are either competitive or noncompetitive ligands at this glutamate receptor complex (CNQX, CGS, TCHP). The IC50 for lamotrigine effects on NMDA-induced currents (in the presence of 3 µM of glycine) in cultured hippocampal neurons exceeded 100 µM.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Folate Metabolism: 
                           
                              
                                 In vitro, lamotrigine was shown to be an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. Inhibition of this enzyme may interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. When oral daily doses of lamotrigine were given to pregnant rats during organogenesis, fetal, placental, and maternal folate concentrations were reduced. Significantly reduced concentrations of folate are associated with teratogenesis (see 
                                    PRECAUTIONS
                                 :

                                 ). Folate concentrations were also reduced in male rats given repeated oral doses of lamotrigine. Reduced concentrations were partially returned to normal when supplemented with folinic acid.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Accumulation in Kidneys:
                           
                              Lamotrigine was found to accumulate in the kidney of the male rat, causing chronic progressive nephrosis, necrosis, and mineralization. These findings are attributed to 〈-2 microglobulin, a species-and sex-specific protein that has not been detected in humans or other animal species.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Melanin Binding: 
                           
                              Lamotrigine binds to melanin-containing tissues, e.g., in the eye and pigmented skin. It has been found in the uveal tract up to 52 weeks after a single dose in rodents.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Cardiovascular: 
                           
                              In dogs, lamotrigine is extensively metabolized to a 2-N-methyl metabolite. This metabolite causes dose-dependent prolongations of the PR interval, widening of the QRS complex, and, at higher doses, complete AV conduction block. Similar cardiovascular effects are not anticipated in humans because only trace amounts of the 2-N-methyl metabolite (< 0.6% of lamotrigine dose) have been found in human urine (see 
                                    Drug Disposition
                                 ). However, it is conceivable that plasma concentrations of this metabolite could be increased in patients with a reduced capacity to glucuronidate lamotrigine (e.g., in patients with liver disease).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism: 
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine have been studied in patients with epilepsy, healthy young and elderly volunteers, and volunteers with chronic renal failure. Lamotrigine pharmacokinetic parameters for adult and pediatric patients and healthy normal volunteers are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
                        


                     



                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Absorption:
                           
                              Lamotrigine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass metabolism (absolute bioavailability is 98%). The bioavailability is not affected by food. Peak plasma concentrations occur anywhere from 1.4 to 4.8 hours following drug administration.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Distribution: 
                           
                              Estimates of the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of lamotrigine following oral administration ranged from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. Vd/F is independent of dose and is similar following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Protein Binding: 
                           
                              Data from in vitro studies indicate that lamotrigine is approximately 55% bound to human plasma proteins at plasma lamotrigine concentrations from 1 to 10 mcg/mL (10 mcg/mL is 4 to 6 times the trough plasma concentration observed in the controlled efficacy trials). Because lamotrigine is not highly bound to plasma proteins, clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are unlikely. The binding of lamotrigine to plasma proteins did not change in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin, phenobarbital, or valproate. Lamotrigine did not displace other AEDs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) from protein binding sites.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Drug Disposition: 
                           
                              Lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation; the major metabolite is an inactive 2-N-glucuronide conjugate. After oral administration of 240 mg of 14C-lamotrigine (15 µCi) to 6 healthy volunteers, 94% was recovered in the urine and 2% was recovered in the feces. The radioactivity in the urine consisted of unchanged lamotrigine (10%), the 2-N-glucuronide (76%), a 5-N-glucurodine (10%), a 2-N-methyl metabolite (0.14%), and other unidentified minor metabolites (4%).

                                 The apparent clearance of lamotrigine is affected by the co-administration of certain medications. Because lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation, drugs that induce or inhibit glucuronidation may affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. 
                              Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone have been shown to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (see 
                                    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                                  and

                                 ). Most clinical experience is derived from patients taking these AEDs. 
                              Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and rifampin have also been shown to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (see
                                     PRECAUTIONS
                                 :

                                 Valproate decreases the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (i.e., more than doubles the elimination half-life of lamotrigine),
                                 whether given with or without carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone. Accordingly, if lamotrigine is to be administered to a patient receiving valproate, lamotrigine must be given at a reduced dosage, no more than half the dose used in patients not receiving valproate, even in the presence of drugs that increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (see 
                                    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                                 and

                                 ).
                              The following drugs were shown not to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine: felbamate, gabapentin, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, and topiramate. Zonisamide does not appear to change the pharmacokinetic profile of lamotrigine (see 
                                    PRECAUTIONS

                                 In vitro inhibition experiments indicated that the formation of the primary metabolite of lamotrigine, the 2-N-glucuronide, was not significantly affected by co-incubation with clozapine, fluoxetine, phenelzine, risperidone, sertraline, or trazodone, and was minimally affected by co-incubation with amitriptyline, bupropion, clonazepam, haloperidol, or lorazepam. In addition, bufuralol metabolism data from human liver microsomes suggested that lamotrigine does not inhibit the metabolism of drugs eliminated predominantly by CYP2D6. 
                              Lamotrigine has no effects on the pharmacokinetics of lithium (see

                              The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine were not changed by co-administration of bupropion (see 
                                    PRECAUTIONS

                              Co-administration of olanzapine did not have a clinically relevant effect on lamotrigine pharmacokinetics (see

Evidence gathered from other sources suggests that selfinduction by lamotrigine may not occur when lamotrigine is given as adjunctive therapy in patients receiving carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or rifampin.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Dose Proportionality: 
                           
                              In healthy volunteers not receiving any other medications and given single doses, the plasma concentrations of lamotrigine increased in direct proportion to the dose administered over the range of 50 to 400 mg. In 2 small studies (n = 7 and 8) of patients with epilepsy who were maintained on other AEDs, there also was a linear relationship between dose and lamotrigine plasma concentrations at steady state following doses of 50 to 350 mg twice daily.

                              Twelve volunteers with chronic renal failure (mean creatinine clearance = 13 mL/min; range = 6 to 23) and another 6 individuals undergoing hemodialysis were each given a single 100 mg dose of lamotrigine. The mean plasma half-lives determined in the study were 42.9 hours (chronic renal failure), 13.0 hours (during hemodialysis), and 57.4 hours (between hemodialysis) compared to 26.2 hours in healthy volunteers. On average, approximately 20% (range = 5.6 to 35.1) of the amount of lamotrigine present in the body was eliminated by hemodialysis during a 4-hour session.
                              Hepatic Disease:
                              The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine following a single 100 mg dose of lamotrigine were evaluated in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh Classification system) and compared with 12 subjects without hepatic impairment. The patients with severe hepatic impairment were without ascites (n = 2) or with ascites (n = 5). The mean apparent clearance of lamotrigine in patients with mild (n = 12), moderate (n = 5), severe without ascites (n = 2), and severe with ascites (n = 5) liver impairment was 0.30 ± 0.09, 0.24 ± 0.1, 0.21 ± 0.04, and 0.15 ± 0.09 mL/min/kg, respectively, as compared to 0.37 ± 0.1 mL/min/kg in the healthy controls. Mean half-life of lamotrigine in patients with mild, moderate, severe without ascites, and severe with ascites liver impairment was 46 ± 20, 72 ± 44, 67 ± 11, and 100 ± 48 hours, respectively, as compared to 33 ± 7 hours in healthy controls (for dosing guidelines, see

                                 Pediatric Patient:
                                 
                                    The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine following a single 2 mg/kg dose were evaluated in 2 studies of pediatric patients (n = 29 for patients aged 10 months to 5.9 years and n = 26 for patients aged 5 to 11 years). Forty-three patients received concomitant therapy with other AEDs and 12 patients received lamotrigine as monotherapy. Lamotrigine pharmacokinetic parameters for pediatric patients are summarized in Table 2. 
                                    Population pharmacokinetic analyses involving patients aged 2 to 18 years demonstrated that lamotrigine clearance was influenced predominantly by total body weight and concurrent AED therapy. The oral clearance of lamotrigine was higher, on a body weight basis, in pediatric patients than in adults. Weight-normalized lamotrigine clearance was higher in those subjects weighing less than 30 kg, compared with those weighing greater than 30 kg. Accordingly, patients weighing less than 30 kg may need an increase of as much as 50% in maintenance doses, based on clinical response, as compared with subjects weighing more than 30 kg being administered the same AEDs (see 
                                          DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                                       ). These analyses also revealed that, after accounting for body weight, lamotrigine clearance was not significantly influenced by age. Thus, the same weight-adjusted doses should be administered to children irrespective of differences in age. Concomitant AEDs which influence lamotrigine clearance in adults were found to have similar effects in children.

                                    The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine following a single 150 mg dose of lamotrigine tablets were evaluated in12 elderly volunteers between the ages of 65 and 76 years (mean creatinine clearance = 61 mL/min, range = 33 to 108 mL/min). The mean half-life of lamotrigine in these subjects was 31.2 hours (range, 24.5 to 43.4 hours), and the mean clearance was 0.40 mL/min/kg (range, 0.26 to 0.48 mL/min/ kg).

                              The clearance of lamotrigine is not affected by gender. However, during dose escalation of lamotrigine in one clinical trial in patients with epilepsy on a stable dose of valproate (n = 77), mean trough lamotrigine concentrations, unadjusted for weight, were 24% to 45% higher (0.3 to 1.7 mcg/mL) in females than in males.
