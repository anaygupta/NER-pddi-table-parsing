                           Corticosteroids, valproic acid, or haloperidol: May increase plasma ammonia level. Monitor ammonia levels closely. (7.1)
                           
                           Probenecid: May affect renal excretion of metabolites of RAVICTI, including PAGN and PAA.

                           Corticosteroids
                        
                        Use of corticosteroids may cause the breakdown of body protein and increase plasma ammonia levels. Monitor ammonia levels closely when corticosteroids and RAVICTI are used concomitantly.
                        
                           Valproic Acid and Haloperidol
                        
                        Hyperammonemia may be induced by haloperidol and by valproic acid. Monitor ammonia levels closely when use of valproic acid or haloperidol is necessary in UCD patients.

                           Probenecid
                        
                        Probenecid may inhibit the renal excretion of metabolites of RAVICTI including PAGN and PAA.
