                  EVITHROM requires no intermediate physiological agent because it clots the fibrinogen of the blood directly. Failure to clot blood occurs in the rare case where the primary clotting defect is the absence of fibrinogen itself. The speed with which thrombin clots blood is dependent upon the concentration of both thrombin and fibrinogen.

               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.1 Mechanism of Action

                     
                        Thrombin (coagulation factor IIa) is a highly specific protease that transforms plasma fibrinogen into fibrin which, in the presence of Factor XIII in the patient's plasma, is cross-linked to form a stable clot. When applied to a surgical wound where bleeding is present, thrombin activates fibrinogen in the patient's plasma to form fibrin, which results in clot formation and hemostasis. The fibrin clot is stabilized by cross-linking occurring as a result of activation of the patient's endogenous factor XIII, which requires the presence of calcium.

                        Clinical pharmacodynamic studies with human thrombin have not been performed as this would be ethically unacceptable with this type of product.

                        Due to the nature of the product, intended for topical application to the surface of tissue at the surgical site, pharmacokinetic studies were not conducted.
