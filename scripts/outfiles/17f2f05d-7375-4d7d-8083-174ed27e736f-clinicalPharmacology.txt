                  Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce intraocular pressure by partially suppressing the secretion of aqueous humor (inflow), although the mechanism by which they do this is not fully understood. Evidence suggests that bicarbonate ions are produced in the ciliary body by hydration of carbon dioxide under the influence of carbonic anhydrase and diffuse into the posterior chamber with sodium ions. The aqueous fluid contains more sodium and bicarbonate ions than does plasma and consequently is hypertonic. Water is attracted to the posterior chamber by osmosis. Systemic administration of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor has been shown to inactivate carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary body of the rabbit's eye and to reduce the high concentration of bicarbonate ions in ocular fluids. As is the case with all carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, DARANIDE® (dichlorphenamide tablets USP) in high doses causes some decreases in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.
                  In man, DARANIDE® (dichlorphenamide tablets USP) begins to act within an hour and maximal effect is observed in two to four hours. The lowered intraocular tension may be maintained for approximately 6 to 12 hours.
