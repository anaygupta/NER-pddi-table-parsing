                           Olanzapine:  Coadministration of eszopiclone and olanzapine produced a decrease in DSST scores.  The interaction was pharmacodynamic; there was no alteration in the pharmacokinetics of either drug.

                              CYP3A4 is a major metabolic pathway for elimination of eszopiclone.  The exposure of eszopiclone was increased by coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, troleandomycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) would be expected to behave similarly. Dose reduction of eszopiclone is needed for patients co-administered eszopiclone with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (

                           Drugs that Induce CYP3A4 (Rifampicin) 
                           
                              Racemic zopiclone exposure was decreased 80% by concomitant use of rifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4.  A similar effect would be expected with eszopiclone. Combination use with CYP3A4 inducer may decrease the exposure and effects of eszopiclone.
