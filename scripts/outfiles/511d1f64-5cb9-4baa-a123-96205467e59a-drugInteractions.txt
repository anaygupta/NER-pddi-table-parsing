                       7.1 Interference with Iodine-Based Diagnostic Tests and Iodine-Based Radiotherapy

                     
                        Following Lipiodol administration, ethiodized oil remains in the body for several months, and may interfere with thyroid function testing for up to two years. Ethiodized oil interferes with radioactive iodine uptake by thyroid tissue for several weeks to months and may impair visualization of thyroid scintigraphy and reduce effectiveness of iodine 131 treatment.
