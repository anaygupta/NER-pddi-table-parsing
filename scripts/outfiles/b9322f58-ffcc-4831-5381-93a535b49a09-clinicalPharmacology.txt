                  TRIDIONE has been shown to prevent pentylenetetrazol-induced and thujone-induced seizures in experimental animals; the drug has a less marked effect on seizures induced by picrotoxin, procaine, cocaine, or strychnine.  Unlike the hydantoins and antiepileptic barbiturates, TRIDIONE does not modify the maximal seizure pattern in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy.
                  TRIDIONE has a sedative effect that may increase to the point of ataxia when excessive doses are used.  A toxic dose of the drug in animals (approximately 2 g/kg) produced sleep, unconsciousness, and respiratory depression.
                  Trimethadione is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  It is demethylated by liver microsomes to the active metabolite, dimethadione.
                  Approximately 3% of a daily dose of TRIDIONE is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug.  The majority of trimethadione is excreted slowly by the kidney in the form of dimethadione.
