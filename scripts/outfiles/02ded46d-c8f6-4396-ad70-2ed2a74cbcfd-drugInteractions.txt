                  When given concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics.
                  Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics
                  Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.
                  Antidiabetic drugs - (oral agents and insulin)
                  Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.
                  Other antihypertensive drugs
                  Additive effect or potentiation.
                  Cholestyramine and colestipol resins
                  Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.
                  Corticosteroids, ACTH
                  Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.
                  Pressor amines (e.g., norepinephrine)
                  Possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use.
                  Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) Possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.
                  Lithium
                  Generally should not be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with hydrochlorothiazide.
                  Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs
                  In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when hydrochlorothiazide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
                  Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions
                  Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function (see PRECAUTIONS, General).
                  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
                  Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice.
                  Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames mutagenicity assay of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained only in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide from 43 to 1300 mcg/mL, and in the Aspergillus nidulans non-disjunction assay at an unspecified concentration.
                  Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation.
