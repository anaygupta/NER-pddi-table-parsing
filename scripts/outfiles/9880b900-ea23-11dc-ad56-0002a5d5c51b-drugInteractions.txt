                        There are no known drug interactions with ADAGEN®
                            (pegademase bovine) Injection. However, Vidarabine is a substrate for ADA and 2′-deoxycoformycin is a potent inhibitor of ADA. Thus, the activities of these drugs and ADAGEN®
                            (pegademase bovine) Injection could be substantially altered if they are used in combination with one another.
