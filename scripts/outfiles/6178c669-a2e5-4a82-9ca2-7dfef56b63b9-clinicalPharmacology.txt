                  Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) retain phosphorus and
                            can develop hyperphosphatemia. When the product of serum calcium and
                            phosphorus concentrations (Ca x P) exceeds 55
                                mg2/dL2, there is an increased risk that
                            ectopic calcification will occur. Hyperphosphatemia plays a role in the
                            development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal insufficiency. 
                  Treatment of hyperphosphatemia includes reduction in dietary
                            intake of phosphate, inhibition of intestinal phosphate absorption with
                            phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate with dialysis. Sevelamer
                            carbonate taken with meals has been shown to control serum phosphorus
                            concentrations in patients with CKD who are on dialysis.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Renvela contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed
                                    phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and
                                    calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon
                                    from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated
                                    form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules
                                    through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in
                                    the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption,
                                  sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the
                                  serum (serum phosphorus).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        In addition to effects on serum phosphorus
                                    levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile
                                    acids 
                              in vitro
                            and 
                              in vivo
                            in experimental animal models. Bile acid binding by
                                    ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering
                                    blood cholesterol. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may
                                    interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce
                                    absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In
                                    clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total
                                    and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%. This effect is
                                    observed after 2 weeks. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and
                                    albumin did not change.

                        A mass balance study using 14C-sevelamer
                                    hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed
                                    that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No
                                    absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal
                                    disease.
