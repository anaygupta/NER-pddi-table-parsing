    Co-administration of anastrozole and tamoxifen in breast cancer patients reduced anastrozole plasma concentration by 27%. However, the coadministration of anastrozole and tamoxifen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen or Ndesmethyltamoxifen. At a median follow-up of 33 months, the combination of anastrozole tablets and tamoxifen did not demonstrate any efficacy benefit when compared with tamoxifen in all patients as well as in the hormone receptor-positive subpopulation. This treatment arm was discontinued from the trial. [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Based on clinical and pharmacokinetic results from the ATAC trial, tamoxifen should not be administered with anastrozole.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        • Tamoxifen: Do not use in combination with anastrozole tablets. No additional benefit seen over tamoxifen monotherapy (         7.1,          14.1).
• Estrogen-containing products: Combination use may diminish activity of anastrozole tablets (         7.2).
