                        Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving Achromycin V (Tetracycline HCl Capsules, USP) in conjunction with penicillin or other bactericidal antibiotics.
                        Because the tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
                        The concurrent use of Achromycin V (Tetracycline HCl Capsules, USP) and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
                        Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and preparations containing iron, zinc, or sodium bicarbonate.
                        Concurrent use of Achromycin V (Tetracycline HCl Capsules, USP) may render oral contraceptives less effective.
