               MAO inhibitors should be used with caution in patients receiving HydrALAZINE.
When other potent parenteral antihypertensive drugs, such as diazoxide, are used in combination with HydrALAZINE, patients should be continuously observed for several hours for any excessive fall in blood pressure. Profound hypotensive episodes may occur when diazoxide injection and HydrALAZINE are used concomitantly.

                  Drug/Food Interactions

                  Administration of HydrALAZINE with food results in higher plasma levels.
