                                 Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics
                              
                           
                           
                              Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor serum potassium frequently.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Lithium
                              
                           
                           
                              Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.
