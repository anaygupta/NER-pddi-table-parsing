                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Latanoprost is a prostanoid selective FP receptor agonist that is believed to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor.  Studies in animals and man suggest that the main mechanism of action is increased uveoscleral outflow.  Elevated IOP represents a major risk factor for glaucomatous field loss.  The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Reduction of the IOP in man starts about 3-4 hours after administration and maximum effect is reached after 8-12 hours.  IOP reduction is present for at least 24 hours.

                           Absorption
                        
                        Latanoprost is absorbed through the cornea where the isopropyl ester prodrug is hydrolyzed to the acid form to become biologically active.
                        
                           Distribution
                        
                        The distribution volume in humans is 0.16 + 0.02 L/kg.  The acid of latanoprost can be measured in aqueous humor during the first 4 hours, and in plasma only during the first hour after local administration.  Studies in man indicate that the peak concentration in the aqueous humor is reached about two hours after topical administration.
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        Latanoprost, an isopropyl ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to the biologically active acid.  The active acid of latanoprost reaching the systemic circulation is primarily metabolized by the liver to the 1,2-dinor and 1,2,3,4-tetranor metabolites via fatty acid ß-oxidation.
                        
                           Excretion
                        
                        The elimination of the acid of latanoprost from human plasma is rapid (t1/2 = 17 min) after both intravenous and topical administration. Systemic clearance is approximately 7 mL/min/kg.  Following hepatic ß-oxidation, the metabolites are mainly eliminated via the kidneys.  Approximately 88% and 98% of the administered dose are recovered in the urine after topical and intravenous dosing, respectively.
