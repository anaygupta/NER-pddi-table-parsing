                     7.1 Antiretroviral Agents
                     
                        Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine and zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated . Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided.

                        Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine.

                        Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin

                        No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP.
