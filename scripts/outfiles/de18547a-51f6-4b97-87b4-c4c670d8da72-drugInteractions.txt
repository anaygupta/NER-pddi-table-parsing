                  General: Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, 
mecamylamine, reserpine and veratrum alkaloids.

                  

                  Other Central Nervous System Depressants: Patients receiving other opioid analgesics, 
sedatives or hypnotics, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, centrally acting anti-emetics, 
phenothiazines or other tranquilizers, or alcohol concomitantly with this combination product 
may exhibit additive depressant effects on the central nervous system. When such combined 
therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. Concomitant use 
of dihydrocodeine and antihistamines with alcohol and other CNS depressants may have an 
additive effect.

                  

                  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Dihydrocodeine, like all opioids, interact with monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors causing central nervous system excitation and hypertension. MAO inhibitors 
and beta-adrenergic blockers increase the effects of sympathomimetics. They may also prolong 
and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines.
