                           7.1 Corticosteroids and Immunosuppressives
                        
                        Corticosteroids and Immunosuppressive agents may suppress the response to the skin test. Pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids may suppress the response to skin test antigens after two weeks of therapy. The mechanism of suppression is thought to involve a decrease in monocytes and lymphocytes, particularly T-cells. The normal DTH response usually returns to pre-treatment levels within several weeks after steroid therapy is discontinued.
