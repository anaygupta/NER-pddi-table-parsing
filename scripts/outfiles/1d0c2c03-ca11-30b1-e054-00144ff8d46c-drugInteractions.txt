                  No specific interaction studies have been conducted with FLOWTUSS.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        • Opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol): Avoid using with FLOWTUSS; may exhibit additive CNS depression. (7.1)
    

• MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) or tricyclic antidepressants: Do not use. May increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone. (7.2)
    

• Anticholinergic drugs: Use with caution in order to avoid paralytic ileus and excessive anticholinergic effects. (7.3)
   
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.1 Opioids, Antihistamines, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety Agents, or Other CNS Depressants (Including Alcohol)
                     
                     
                        The use of opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants concomitantly with FLOWTUSS may cause an additive CNS depressant effect and should be avoided.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.2 MAO Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants
                     
                     
                        Do not prescribe FLOWTUSS if the patient is taking a prescription MAOI (i.e., certain drugs used for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson’s disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping a MAOI drug. The use of MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone [
  see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.3 Anticholinergic Drugs
                     
                     
                        Hydrocodone should be administered cautiously to persons receiving anticholinergic drugs in order to avoid paralytic ileus and excessive anticholinergic effects [
  see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
