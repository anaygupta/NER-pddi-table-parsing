                        Levoleucovorin is the pharmacologically active isomer of 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid. Levoleucovorin does not require reduction by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase in order to participate in reactions utilizing folates as a source of “one-carbon” moieties. Administration of levoleucovorin can counteract the therapeutic and toxic effects of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Levoleucovorin is actively  and passively  transported across cell membranes. In vivo, levoleucovorin is converted to 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-methyl-THF), the primary circulating form of active reduced folate.  Levoleucovorin and 5-methyl-THF are polyglutamated intracellularly by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase.  Folylpolyglutamates are active and participate in biochemical pathways that require reduced folate.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of levoleucovorin after intravenous administration of a 15 mg dose was studied in healthy male volunteers. After rapid intravenous administration, serum total tetrahydrofolate (total-THF) concentrations reached a mean peak of 1722 ng/mL. Serum (6S)-5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate concentrations reached a mean peak of 275 ng/mL and the mean time to peak was 0.9 hours. The mean terminal half-life for total-THF and (6S)-5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate was 5.1 and 6.8 hours, respectively.
                        A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 40 healthy subjects who received a single intravenous dose of either levoleucovorin  (200 mg/m2) or racemic d,l-leucovorin (400 mg/m2), each administered as a 2-hour infusion in a crossover design. Results indicate that the 90% confidence interval for the geometric mean ratios for both AUC0-inf and Cmax were within the standard limit of 80 to 125% for both l-leucovorin and l-5-methyl-THF. Therefore, the exposure to l-leucovorin and 5-methyl-THF (AUC0-inf and Cmax) was comparable whether it was administered as levoleucovorin  or as d,l-leucovorin. The geometric mean AUC0-inf values for levoleucovorin were 30719 ng.h/mL and 31296 ng.h/mL for levoleucovorin  and d,l-leucovorin, respectively. The geometric mean Cmax values for levoleucovorin were 10895 ng/mL and 11301 ng/ mL for levoleucovorin and d
                           ,l-leucovorin, respectively. The geometric mean AUC0-inf values for 5-methyl-THF were 52105 ng.h/mL and 50137 ng.h/mL for levoleucovorin and d
                           ,l-leucovorin, respectively. The geometric mean Cmax values for 5-methyl-THF were 4930 ng/mL and 4658 ng/mL for levoleucovorin and d
                           ,l-leucovorin, respectively.
