                           Concurrent and/or sequential use with other drugs with neurotoxic, nephrotoxic or ototoxic potential should be avoided (7.1).

                           Concomitant administration with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol is not recommended due to possible enhancement of aminoglycoside toxicity (7.2).

                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Drugs with Neurotoxic, Nephrotoxic or Ototoxic Potential

                     
                        Concurrent and/or sequential use of tobramycin inhalation solution with other drugs with neurotoxic, nephrotoxic, or ototoxic potential should be avoided if possible.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Diuretics

                     
                        Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering aminoglycoside concentrations in serum and tissue. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be administered concomitantly with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol.
