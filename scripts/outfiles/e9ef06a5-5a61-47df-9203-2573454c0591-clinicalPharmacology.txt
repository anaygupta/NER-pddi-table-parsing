                  Carrier-free Gallium Citrate Ga 67 Injection has been found to concentrate in certain viable primary and metastatic tumors, as well as focal site of infection.  The mechanism of concentration is unknown, but investigational studies have shown that Gallium Ga 67 accumulates in lysosomes and is bound to a soluble intracellular protein.
                  It has been reported in the scientific literature that following intravenous injection, the highest tissue concentration of Gallium Ga 67 – other than tumors and sites of infection– is in the renal cortex.  After the first day, the maximum concentration shifts to bone and lymph nodes, and after the first week, to liver and spleen. Gallium is excreted relatively slowly from the body.  The average whole body retention is 65% after 7 days, with 26% having been excreted in the urine and 9% in the stools.
