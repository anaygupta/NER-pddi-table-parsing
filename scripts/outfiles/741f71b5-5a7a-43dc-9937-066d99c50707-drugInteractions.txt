                  There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between Phoslyra and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medications where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Consider monitoring clinical responses or blood levels of concomitant medications that have a narrow therapeutic range.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           PHOSLYRA may decrease the bioavailability of tetracyclines fluoroquinolones or levothyroxine. (7)
                           When clinically significant drug interactions are expected, separate dosing from PHOSLYRA, or consider monitoring blood levels of the drug. (7)
