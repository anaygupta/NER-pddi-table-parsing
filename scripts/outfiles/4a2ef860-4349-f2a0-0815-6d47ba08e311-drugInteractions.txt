                                                  were assessed in controlled clinical
                                                  pharmacokinetic studies in patients with epilepsy.
                                                  The effects of these interactions on mean plasma

                                                  (topiramate concentration) describes how the

                           Digoxin: In a
                                                  single-dose study, serum digoxin AUC was decreased
                                                  by 12% with concomitant Topiramate administration.
                                                  The clinical relevance of this observation has not

                           CNS Depressants:
                                                  Concomitant administration of Topiramate
                                                  and alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs has not
                                                  been evaluated in clinical studies. Because of the
                                                  potential of topiramate to cause CNS depression,
                                                  as well as other cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric
                                                  adverse events, topiramate should be used with
                                                  extreme caution if used in combination with
                                                  alcohol and other CNS depressants. 
                        
                           
                              
Oral Contraceptives:
                                                  In a pharmacokinetic interaction study
                                                  in healthy volunteers with a concomitantly
                                                  administered combination oral contraceptive
                                                  product containing 1 mg norethindrone (NET) plus
                                                  35 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE), Topiramate given in

                                                  200 mg/day was not associated with statistically
                                                  significant changes in mean exposure (AUC) to
                                                  either component of the oral contraceptive. In
                                                  another study, exposure to EE was statistically
                                                  significantly decreased at doses of 200, 400, and
                                                  800 mg/day (18%, 21%, and 30%, respectively) when
                                                  given as adjunctive therapy in patients taking
                                                  valproic acid. In both studies, Topiramate (50
                                                  mg/day to 800 mg/day) did not significantly affect
                                                  exposure to NET. Although there was a dose
                                                  dependent decrease in EE exposure for doses
                                                  between 200 to 800 mg/day, there was no
                                                  significant dose dependent change in EE exposure
                                                  for doses of 50 to 200 mg/day. The clinical
                                                  significance of the changes observed is not known.
                                                  The possibility of decreased contraceptive
                                                  efficacy and increased breakthrough bleeding
                                                  should be considered in patients taking
                                                  combination oral contraceptive products with
                                                  Topiramate. Patients taking estrogen containing
                                                  contraceptives should be asked to report any
                                                  change in their bleeding patterns. Contraceptive
                                                  efficacy can be decreased even in the absence of
                                                  breakthrough bleeding.
                        
                           Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ):
                                                  A drug-drug interaction study conducted
                                                  in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state
                                                  pharmacokinetics of HCTZ (25 mg q24h) and
                                                  topiramate (96 mg q12h) when administered alone
                                                  and concomitantly. The results of this study
                                                  indicate that topiramate Cmax increased
                                                  by 27% and AUC increased by 29% when HCTZ was
                                                  added to topiramate. The clinical significance of
                                                  this change is unknown. The addition of HCTZ to
                                                  topiramate therapy may require an adjustment of
                                                  the topiramate dose. The steady-state
                                                  pharmacokinetics of HCTZ were not significantly
                                                  influenced by the concomitant administration of
                                                  topiramate. Clinical laboratory results indicated
                                                  decreases in serum potassium after topiramate or
                                                  HCTZ administration, which were greater when HCTZ
                                                  and topiramate were administered in
                                                  combination.
                        
                           Pioglitazone: A
                                                  drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy
                                                  volunteers evaluated the steady-state
                                                  pharmacokinetics of topiramate and pioglitazone
                                                  when administered alone and concomitantly. A 15%
                                                  decrease in the AUCÏ„,ss of pioglitazone with
                                                  no alteration in Cmax,ss was observed.
                                                  This finding was not statistically significant. In
                                                  addition, a 13% and 16% decrease in
                                                  Cmax,ss and AUCÏ„,ss respectively,
                                                  of the active hydroxy-metabolite was noted as well
                                                  as a 60% decrease in Cmax,ss and
                                                  AUCÏ„,ss of the active keto-metabolite. The
                                                  clinical significance of these findings is not
                                                  known. When Topiramate is added to pioglitazone
                                                  therapy or pioglitazone is added to Topiramate
                                                  therapy, careful attention should be given to the
                                                  routine monitoring of patients for adequate

                                                  topiramate (100 mg every 12 hrs) in 24
                                                  healthyÂ  volunteers (14 M, 10 F) did not

                           Risperidone: There was
                                                  a 25% decrease in exposure to risperidone (2 mg
