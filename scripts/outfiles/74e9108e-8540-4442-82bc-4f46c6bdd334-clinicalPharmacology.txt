                  After intravenous injection, Mannitol is confined to the extracellular space, metabolized only slightly and excreted rapidly by the kidneys. Approximately 80 percent of a 100 g dose appears in the urine in 3 hours. Mannitol is freely filtered by the glomeruli with less than 10 percent tubular reabsorption. It is not secreted by tubular cells. It induces diuresis by elevating the osmolarity of the glomerular filtrate and thereby hinders tubular reabsorption of water. Urinary output of water and excretion of sodium and chloride are enhanced. Mannitol is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Mannitol solution is free of electrolytes and is used in urology as a nonhemolytic irrigant. The amount of mannitol absorbed intravascularly during transurethral prostatic surgery is variable and depends primarily on the extent of the surgery. Such mannitol is excreted by the kidneys and produces osmotic diuresis.
