                  When Sestamibi is reconstituted with Tc99m pertechnetate, a complex of Tc99m Sestamibi is formed and is the active ingredient of the reconstituted product. When administered intravenously, Tc99m Sestamibi shows rapid myocardial uptake and its distribution follows a linear relationship with coronary blood flow.
                  Tc99m Sestamibi is a lipophilic agent that is taken up by the mitochondria of myocardial cells by passive diffusion and appears to accumulate in viable myocardial tissue.
