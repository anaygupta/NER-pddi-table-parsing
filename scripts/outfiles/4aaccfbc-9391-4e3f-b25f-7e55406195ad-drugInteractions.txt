Avoid contact with the peel of limes. Particular caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of topical over-the-counter acne preparations containing benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1% and 0.04%. It also is advisable to allow the effects of such preparations to subside before use of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1% and 0.04% is begun.
