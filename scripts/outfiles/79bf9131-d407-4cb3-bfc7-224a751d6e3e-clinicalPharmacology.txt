                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown.

                        Clinical pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted for adapalene gel, 0.3%.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Systemic exposure of adapalene following topical application of adapalene gel was evaluated in a clinical study. Sixteen acne patients were treated once daily for 10 days with 2 grams of adapalene gel, 0.3% applied to the face, chest and back, corresponding to approximately 2 mg/cm2. Fifteen patients had quantifiable (LOQ =0.1 ng/mL) adapalene levels resulting in a mean Cmax of 0.553 ± 0.466 ng/mL on Day 10 of treatment. The mean AUC0-24hr was 8.37 ± 8.46 ng.h/mL as determined in 15 of the 16 patients on Day 10. The terminal apparent half-life, determined in 15 of 16 patients, ranged from 7 to 51 hours, with a mean of 17.2 ± 10.2 hours. Adapalene was rapidly cleared from plasma and was not detected 72 hours after the last application for all but one subject. Exposure of potential circulating metabolites of adapalene was not measured. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route.
                        In another clinical study in patients with moderate to moderately severe acne, adapalene gel, 0.3% or Adapalene Gel, 0.1% was applied to the face and optionally to the trunk, once daily for 12 weeks. Seventy-eight (78) patients had plasma adapalene levels evaluated at Weeks 2, 8, and 12. Of the 209 plasma samples analyzed, adapalene concentrations were below the limit of detection (LOD = 0.15 ng/mL) of the method in all samples but three. For the three samples, traces of adapalene below the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.25 ng/mL) of the method were found. One of these samples was taken at Week 12 from a male patient treated with adapalene gel, 0.3% who treated the face and the trunk for eight weeks (thereafter, only the face was treated). The second and third samples were from the Week 2 and 12 visits of a female patient treated with adapalene gel, 0.1% who treated only the face for 12 weeks. In this study, the average daily usage of product was 1 g/day.
