 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY





 Animal Studies
Prostaglandins have been shown in many animal models to be mediators of certain kinds of intraocular inflammation. In studies performed in animal eyes, prostaglandins have been shown to produce disruption of the blood-aqueous humor barrier, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, leukocytosis, and increased intraocular pressure.






 Pharmacodynamics
Diclofenac sodium is one of a series of phenylacetic acids that have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in pharmacological studies. It is thought to inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is essential in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins.






 Pharmacokinetics
Results from a bioavailability study of another formulation of diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution established that plasma levels of diclofenac following ocular instillation of two drops of diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution, 0.1% to each eye were below the limit of quantitation (10 ng/mL) over a 4-hour period. This study suggests that limited, if any, systemic absorption occurs with diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution, 0.1%.






 Clinical Trials





 Postoperative Anti-Inflammatory Effects
In a clinical therapeutic equivalence study, Diclofenac Sodium Ophthalmic Solution, 0.1%, was found to be therapeutically equivalent to VOLTAREN OPHTHALMIC® (diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution) [CIBA VISION OPHTHALMICS®] in the treatment of signs and symptoms of inflammation resulting from cataract surgery.
