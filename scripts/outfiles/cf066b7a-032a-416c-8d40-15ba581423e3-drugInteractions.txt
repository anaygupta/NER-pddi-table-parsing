                           Drugs That Induce CYP 3A4
                        
                        Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John's wort) may significantly decrease exposure to exemestane. Dose modification is recommended for patients who are also receiving a strong CYP 3A4 inducer [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
