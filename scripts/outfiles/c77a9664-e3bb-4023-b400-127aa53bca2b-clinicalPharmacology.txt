                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Ustekinumab is a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that binds with specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab was shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell-surface receptor chain, IL-12Rβ1.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        In a small exploratory study, a decrease was observed in the expression of mRNA of its molecular targets IL-12 and IL-23 in lesional skin biopsies measured at baseline and up to two weeks post-treatment in subjects with psoriasis.

                              In subjects with psoriasis, the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) was 13.5 days and 7 days, respectively, after a single subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=22) and 90 mg (N=24) of ustekinumab. In healthy subjects (N=30), the median Tmax value (8.5 days) following a single subcutaneous administration of 90 mg of ustekinumab was comparable to that observed in subjects with psoriasis. Following multiple subcutaneous doses of STELARA®, the steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. The mean (±SD) steady-state trough serum concentration ranged from 0.31 ± 0.33 mcg/mL (45 mg) to 0.64 ± 0.64 mcg/mL (90 mg). There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks.

                              Following subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=18) and 90 mg (N=21) of ustekinumab to subjects with psoriasis, the mean (±SD) apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz/F) was 161 ± 65 mL/kg and 179 ± 85 mL/kg, respectively. The mean (±SD) volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) following a single intravenous administration to subjects with psoriasis ranged from 56.1 ± 6.5 to 82.1 ± 23.6 mL/kg. 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Metabolism
                              
                              The metabolic pathway of ustekinumab has not been characterized. As a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody ustekinumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG.

                              The mean (±SD) systemic clearance (CL) following a single intravenous administration of ustekinumab to subjects with psoriasis ranged from 1.90 ± 0.28 to 2.22 ± 0.63 mL/day/kg. The mean (±SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 ± 4.6 to 45.6 ± 80.2 days across all psoriasis studies following intravenous and subcutaneous administration.

                              When given the same dose, subjects with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis weighing >100 kg had lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with those subjects weighing ≤100 kg. The median trough serum concentrations of ustekinumab in subjects of higher weight (>100 kg) in the 90 mg group were comparable to those in subjects of lower weight (≤100 kg) in the 45 mg group.

                              A population pharmacokinetic analysis (N=106/1937 subjects greater than or equal to 65 years old) was performed to evaluate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. There were no apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in subjects older than 65 years old.

                              The effects of IL-12 or IL-23 on the regulation of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in an in vitro study using human hepatocytes, which showed that IL-12 and/or IL-23 at levels of 10 ng/mL did not alter human CYP450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). However, the clinical relevance of in vitro data has not been established [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
                              Population pharmacokinetic data analyses indicated that the clearance of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant MTX, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids, or prior exposure to anti-TNFα agents in patients with psoriatic arthritis.
