Trasylol® is known to have antifibrinolytic activity and, therefore, may inhibit the effects of fibrinolytic agents.® is known to have antifibrinolytic activity and, therefore, may inhibit the effects of fibrinolytic agents.In study of nine patients with untreated hypertension, Trasylol® infused intravenously in a dose of 2 million KIU over two hours blocked the acute hypotensive effect of 100mg of captopril.® infused intravenously in a dose of 2 million KIU over two hours blocked the acute hypotensive effect of 100mg of captopril.Trasylol®, in the presence of heparin, has been found to prolong the activated clotting time (ACT) as measured by a celite surface activation method. The kaolin activated clotting time appears to be much less affected. However, Trasylol® should not be viewed as a heparin sparing agent (see Laboratory Monitoring of Anticoagulation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass).®, in the presence of heparin, has been found to prolong the activated clotting time (ACT) as measured by a celite surface activation method.
