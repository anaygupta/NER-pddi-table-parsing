                        The pharmacodynamics of Picato® gel is unknown.

                           The systemic exposure to Picato® gel, 0.05% was assessed in two studies in a total of 16 subjects with AK, following application of approximately 1 g of Picato® gel, 0.05% to an area of 100 cm2 of the dorsal forearm once daily for two consecutive days. In these studies, the blood levels of ingenol mebutate and two of its metabolites (acyl isomers of ingenol mebutate) were measured. Blood levels of ingenol mebutate and the two metabolites were below the lower limit of quantification (0.1 ng/mL) in all the blood samples of the subjects evaluated.
                        
                        
                           
                        
                        
                           
                              Drug Interactions
                           
                        
                        
                           In vitro studies demonstrated that [3H]-ingenol mebutate undergoes extensive metabolism in human hepatocytes.
                        
                        
                           
                        
                        In vitro studies to assess the potential of ingenol mebutate to inhibit or induce human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes demonstrated that ingenol mebutate does not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 or induce CYP 1A2, 2C9, and 3A4. The estimated expected systemic exposure (< 0.1 ng/mL) following topical application of Picato® gel, 0.05% to AK subjects in the pharmacokinetic studies described above is negligible compared to the concentrations of ingenol mebutate evaluated in the in vitro studies.
