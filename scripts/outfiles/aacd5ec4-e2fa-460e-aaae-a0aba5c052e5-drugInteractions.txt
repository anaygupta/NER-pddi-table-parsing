                         As adapalene gel, 0.3% has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution. Use with caution, especially when using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid in combination with adapalene gel, 0.3%.

                        As adapalene gel, 0.3% has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid in combination with adapalene gel, 0.3%. If these preparations have been used, it is advisable not to start therapy with adapalene gel, 0.3%, until the effects of such preparations have subsided.
                        No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with adapalene gel, 0.3%.
