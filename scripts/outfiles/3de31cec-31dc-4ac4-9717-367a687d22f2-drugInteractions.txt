                     7.1		Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs
                     
                        Co-administration of EGRIFTA® with simvastatin, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, showed that EGRIFTA® had no significant impact on the pharmacokinetics profiles of simvastatin in healthy subjects. This result suggests that EGRIFTA® may not significantly affect CYP3A activity. Other isoenzymes of CYP450 have not been evaluated with EGRIFTA®. Published data, however, indicate that GH may modulate cytochrome P450 (CYP450) mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that GH may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Because tesamorelin stimulates GH production, careful monitoring is advisable when EGRIFTA® is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2     11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (11βHSD-1)
                     
                        GH is known to inhibit 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1), a microsomal enzyme required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue.  Because tesamorelin stimulates GH production, patients receiving glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in maintenance or stress doses following initiation of EGRIFTA®, particularly in patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone because conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1.
