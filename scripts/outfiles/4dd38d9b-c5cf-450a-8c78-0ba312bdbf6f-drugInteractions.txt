                        When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with ampicillin:
                        Allopurinol - Increased possibility of skin rash; particularly in hyperuricemic patients may occur. 
                        Bacteriostatic antibiotics - Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of penicillins. This has been demonstrated in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well-documented. 
                        Oral contraceptives - May be less effective and increased breakthrough bleeding may occur. 
                        Probenecid - May decrease renal tubular secretion of ampicillin resulting in increased blood levels and/or ampicillin toxicity. 
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions
                           
                              After treatment with ampicillin, a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper sulfate tests (Benedict's solution, Fehling's solution, or Clinitest® tablets) but not with enzyme based tests such as Clinistix® and Tes-Tape® (Glucose Enzymatic Test Strip USP).
