                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Endogenous androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal chord thickening, alterations in body musculature and fat distribution. Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex characteristics. 
                        
                           
                               Male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion of testosterone, has two main etiologies. Primary hypogonadism caused by defects of the gonads, such as Klinefelter’s Syndrome or Leydigcellaplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins(FSH, LH).
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted using Testosterone Gel 1%.

                              Absorption
                           
                        
                        Testosterone Gel 1% delivers physiologic amounts of testosterone, producing circulating testosterone concentrations that approximate normal concentrations (298 - 1043 ng/dL) seen in healthy men. Testosterone Gel 1% provides continuous transdermal delivery of testosterone for 24 hours following a single application to intact, clean, dry skin of the shoulders, upper arms and/or abdomen.
                        Testosterone Gel 1% is a hydroalcoholic formulation that dries quickly when applied to the skin surface. The skin serves as a reservoir for the sustained release of testosterone into the systemic circulation. Approximately 10% of the testosterone dose applied on the skin surface from Testosterone Gel is absorbed into systemic circulation. In a study with Testosterone Gel 1% 100 mg , all patients showed an increase in serum testosterone within 30 minutes, and eight of nine patients had a serum testosterone concentration within normal range by 4 hours after the initial application. Absorption of testosterone into the blood continues for the entire 24-hour dosing interval. Serum concentrations approximate the steady state concentration by the end of the first 24 hours and are at steady state by the second or third day of dosing.
                        With single daily applications of Testosterone Gel 1%, follow-up measurements 30, 90 and 180 days after starting treatment have confirmed that serum testosterone concentrations are generally maintained within the eugonadal range. Figure 1 summarizes the 24-hour pharmacokinetic profiles of testosterone for hypogonadal men (less than 300 ng/dL) maintained on Testosterone Gel 1% 50 mg or 100 mg for 30 days. The average (± SD) daily testosterone concentration produced by Testosterone Gel 1% 100 mg on Day 30 was 792 (± 294) ng/dL and by Testosterone Gel 1% 50 mg 566 (± 262) ng/dL.

                              Distribution
                           
                        
                        Circulating testosterone is primarily bound in the serum to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Approximately 40% of testosterone in plasma is bound to SHBG, 2% remains unbound (free) and the rest is bound to albumin and other proteins.
                        
                           
                              Metabolism
                           
                        
                        Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. The major active metabolites of testosterone are estradiol and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
                        DHT concentrations increased in parallel with testosterone concentrations during Testosterone Gel 1% treatment. The mean steady state DHT/T ratio during 180 days of Testosterone Gel treatment ranged from 0.23 to 0.29 (50 mg of Testosterone Gel 1%/day) and from 0.27 to 0.33 (100 mg of Testosterone Gel 1%/day).
                        
                           
                              Excretion
                           
                        
                        There is considerable variation in the half-life of testosterone concentration as reported in the literature, ranging from 10 to 100 minutes. About 90% of a dose of testosterone given intramuscularly is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites. About 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver.
                        When Testosterone Gel 1% treatment is discontinued after achieving steady state, serum testosterone concentrations remain in the normal range for 24 to 48 hours but return to their pretreatment concentrations by the fifth day after the last application.
                        
                           Testosterone Transfer from Male Patients to Female Partners
                        
                        The potential for dermal testosterone transfer following Testosterone Gel 1% use was evaluated in a clinical study between males dosed with Testosterone Gel 1% and their untreated female partners. Two (2) to 12 hours after application of 100 mg of testosterone administered as Testosterone Gel 1% by the male subjects, the couples (N = 38 couples) engaged in daily, 15-minute sessions of vigorous skin-to-skin contact so that the female partners gained maximum exposure to the Testosterone Gel 1% application sites. Under these study conditions, all unprotected female partners had a serum testosterone concentration >2 times the baseline value at some time during the study. When a shirt covered the application site(s), the transfer of testosterone from the males to the female partners was completely prevented.
