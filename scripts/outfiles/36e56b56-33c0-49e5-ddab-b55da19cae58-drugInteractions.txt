                        Normosol-R pH 7.4 does not contain calcium to avoid precipitation of calcium salts that may occur when certain drugs are added. Solutions which contain calcium in amounts exceeding the normal plasma concentration may enhance clotting on contact with citrated blood. Hence, Normosol-R pH 7.4 can be used for starting a blood transfusion.
