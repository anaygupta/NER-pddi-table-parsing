                  When administered intravenously, these solutions provide sources                             of water and electrolytes with or without minimal carbohydrate calories.                             Their electrolyte content resembles that of the principal ionic                             constituents of normal plasma and the solutions therefore are suitable                             for parenteral replacement of extracellular losses of fluid and                             electrolytes, with or without carbohydrate calories.
                    Solutions containing carbohydrate in                             the form of dextrose restore blood glucose levels and provide calories.
                     Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid                             in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein-sparing                             action. Dextrose injected parenterally undergoes oxidation to carbon                             dioxide and water.
                     Calcium chloride in water dissociates to                             provide calcium (Ca++) and chloride                             (Cl−) ions. They are normal constituents of the                             body fluids and are dependent on various physiologic mechanisms for                             maintenance of balance between intake and output. Approximately 80% of                             body calcium is excreted in the feces as insoluble salts; urinary                             excretion accounts for the remaining 20%.
                    Potassium chloride in water                             dissociates to provide potassium (K+) and chloride                                 (Cl−) ions. Potassium is found in low                             concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter                             in a healthy adult). It is the chief cation of body cells (160 mEq/liter                             of intracellular water). Potassium plays an important role in                             electrolyte balance. Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is                             excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small                             extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well                             so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium-free diet,                             potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion.
                     Sodium chloride in water dissociates to                             provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−)                             ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the                             extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and                             electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl−) has an                             integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide                             exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion                             of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) are                             largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance                             between intake and output.
                     Water is an essential constituent of all                             body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight.                             Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters                             (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and                             urine production).
                    Water balance is maintained by                             various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on                             the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium                                 (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic                             equilibrium.
