                  Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase.  Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate.  Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication.  Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate.  When cellular proliferation in malignant tissues is greater than in most normal tissues, methotrexate may impair malignant growth without irreversible damage to normal tissues.
                  The mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown; it may affect immune function.  Two reports describe 
                        in vitro 
                     methotrexate inhibition of DNA precursor uptake by stimulated mononuclear cells, and another describes in animal polyarthritis partial correction by methotrexate of spleen cell hyporesponsiveness and suppressed IL 2 production.  Other laboratories, however, have been unable to demonstrate similar effects.  Clarification of methotrexate’s effect on immune activity and its relation to rheumatoid immunopathogenesis await further studies.
                  In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, effects of methotrexate on articular swelling and tenderness can be seen as early as 3 to 6 weeks.  Although methotrexate clearly ameliorates symptoms of inflammation (pain, swelling, stiffness), there is no evidence that it induces remission of rheumatoid arthritis nor has a beneficial effect been demonstrated on bone erosions and other radiologic changes which result in impaired joint use, functional disability, and deformity.
                  Most studies of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are relatively short-term (3 to 6 months).  Limited data from long-term studies indicate that an initial clinical improvement is maintained for at least two years with continued therapy.
                  In psoriasis, the rate of production of epithelial cells in the skin is greatly increased over normal skin.  This differential in proliferation rates is the basis for the use of methotrexate to control the psoriatic process.
                  Methotrexate in high doses, followed by leucovorin rescue, is used as a part of the treatment of patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma.  The original rationale for high-dose methotrexate therapy was based on the concept of selective rescue of normal tissues by leucovorin.  More recent evidence suggests that high-dose methotrexate may also overcome methotrexate resistance caused by impaired active transport, decreased affinity of dihydrofolic acid reductase for methotrexate, increased levels of dihydrofolic acid reductase resulting from gene amplification, or decreased polyglutamation of methotrexate.  The actual mechanism of action is unknown.
                  In a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 127 pediatric patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) (mean age, 10.1 years; age range, 2.5 to 18 years; mean duration of disease, 5.1 years) on background non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or prednisone, methotrexate given weekly at an oral dose of 10 mg/m2 provided significant clinical improvement compared to placebo as measured by either the physician’s global assessment, or by a patient composite (25% reduction in the articular-severity score plus improvement in parent and physician global assessments of disease activity).  Over two-thirds of the patients in this trial had polyarticular-course JRA, and the numerically greatest response was seen in this subgroup treated with 10 mg/m2/wk methotrexate.  The overwhelming majority of the remaining patients had systemic-course JRA.  All patients were unresponsive to NSAIDs; approximately one-third were using low-dose corticosteroids.  Weekly methotrexate at a dose of 5 mg/m2 was not significantly more effective than placebo in this trial.
                  Two Pediatric Oncology Group studies (one randomized and one non-randomized) demonstrated a significant improvement in relapse-free survival in patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma, when high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue was used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents following surgical resection of the primary tumor.  These studies were not designed to demonstrate the specific contribution of high-dose methotrexate/leucovorin rescue therapy to the efficacy of the combination.  However, a contribution can be inferred from the reports of objective responses to this therapy in patients with metastatic osteosarcoma, and from reports of extensive tumor necrosis following preoperative administration of this therapy to patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma.

                              Absorption
                           
                        
                        In adults, oral absorption appears to be dose dependent.  Peak serum levels are reached within one to two hours.  At doses of 30 mg/m2 or less, methotrexate is generally well absorbed with a mean bioavailability of about 60%.  The absorption of doses greater than 80 mg/m2 is significantly less, possibly due to a saturation effect.
                        In leukemic pediatric patients, oral absorption of methotrexate also appears to be dose dependent and has been reported to vary widely (23% to 95%).  A twenty fold difference between highest and lowest peak levels (Cmax: 0.11 to 2.3 micromolar after a 20 mg/m2 dose) has been reported.  Significant interindividual variability has also been noted in time to peak concentration (Tmax: 0.67 to 4 hrs after a 15 mg/m2 dose) and fraction of dose absorbed.  The absorption of doses greater than 40 mg/m2 has been reported to be significantly less than that of lower doses.  Food has been shown to delay absorption and reduce peak concentration.  Methotrexate is generally completely absorbed from parenteral routes of injection.  After intramuscular injection, peak serum concentrations occur in 30 to 60 minutes.  As in leukemic pediatric patients, a wide interindividual variability in the plasma concentrations of methotrexate has been reported in pediatric patients with JRA.  Following oral administration of methotrexate in doses of 6.4 to 11.2 mg/m2/week in pediatric patients with JRA, mean serum concentrations were 0.59 micromolar (range, 0.03 to 1.4) at 1 hour, 0.44 micromolar (range, 0.01 to 1) at 2 hours, and 0.29 micromolar (range, 0.06 to 0.58) at 3 hours.  In pediatric patients receiving methotrexate for acute lymphocytic leukemia (6.3 to 30 mg/m2), or for JRA (3.75 to 26.2 mg/m2), the terminal half-life has been reported to range from 0.7 to 5.8 hours or 0.9 to 2.3 hours, respectively. 
                        
                           
                              Distribution
                           
                        
                        After intravenous administration, the initial volume of distribution is approximately 0.18 L/kg (18% of body weight) and steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 0.4 to 0.8 L/kg (40 to 80% of body weight).  Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes by means of a single carrier-mediated active transport process.  At serum concentrations greater than 100 micromolar, passive diffusion becomes a major pathway by which effective intracellular concentrations can be achieved. Methotrexate in serum is approximately 50% protein bound.  Laboratory studies demonstrate that it may be displaced from plasma albumin by various compounds including sulfonamides, salicylates, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and phenytoin.
                        Methotrexate does not penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in therapeutic amounts when given orally or parenterally.  High CSF concentrations of the drug may be attained by intrathecal administration.
                        In dogs, synovial fluid concentrations after oral dosing were higher in inflamed than uninflamed joints.  Although salicylates did not interfere with this penetration, prior prednisone treatment reduced penetration into inflamed joints to the level of normal joints.
                        
                           
                              Metabolism
                           
                        
                        After absorption, methotrexate undergoes hepatic and intracellular metabolism to polyglutamated forms which can be converted back to methotrexate by hydrolase enzymes. These polyglutamates act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase.  Small amounts of methotrexate polyglutamates may remain in tissues for extended periods. The retention and prolonged drug action of these active metabolites vary among different cells, tissues and tumors.  A small amount of metabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate may occur at doses commonly prescribed.  Accumulation of this metabolite may become significant at the high doses used in osteogenic sarcoma.  The aqueous solubility of 7-hydroxymethotrexate is 3 to 5 fold lower than the parent compound. Methotrexate is partially metabolized by intestinal flora after oral administration.
                         
                        
                           Half-Life
                        
                        The terminal half-life reported for methotrexate is approximately three to ten hours for patients receiving treatment for psoriasis, or rheumatoid arthritis or low-dose antineoplastic therapy (less than 30 mg/m2).  For patients receiving high doses of methotrexate, the terminal half-life is eight to 15 hours. 
                        
                           
                              Excretion
                           
                        
                        Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent upon dosage and route of administration.  With IV administration, 80% to 90% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours.  There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or less of the administered dose. Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate has been proposed.
                        Renal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.  Non-linear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in psoriatic patients at doses between 7.5 and 30 mg.  Impaired renal function, as well as concurrent use of drugs such as weak organic acids that also undergo tubular secretion, can markedly increase methotrexate serum levels.  Excellent correlation has been reported between methotrexate clearance and endogenous creatinine clearance.
                        Methotrexate clearance rates vary widely and are generally decreased at higher doses.  Delayed drug clearance has been identified as one of the major factors responsible for methotrexate toxicity.  It has been postulated that the toxicity of methotrexate for normal tissues is more dependent upon the duration of exposure to the drug rather than the peak level achieved.  When a patient has delayed drug elimination due to compromised renal function, a third space effusion, or other causes, methotrexate serum concentrations may remain elevated for prolonged periods.
                        The potential for toxicity from high-dose regimens or delayed excretion is reduced by the administration of leucovorin calcium during the final phase of methotrexate plasma elimination.  Pharmacokinetic monitoring of methotrexate serum concentrations may help identify those patients at high risk for methotrexate toxicity and aid in proper adjustment of leucovorin dosing.  Guidelines for monitoring serum methotrexate levels, and for adjustment of leucovorin dosing to reduce the risk of methotrexate toxicity, are provided below in
