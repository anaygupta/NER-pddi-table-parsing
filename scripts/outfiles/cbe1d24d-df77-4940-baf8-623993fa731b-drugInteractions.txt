                        Drugs can interfere with the performance of skin tests.8
                        
                        Antihistamines: Response to mediator (histamine) released by allergens is suppressed by antihistamines.  The length of suppression varies and is dependent on individual patient, type of antihistamine and length of time the patient has been on antihistamines.  The duration of this suppression may be as little as 24 hours to several days.
                        Tricyclic Antidepressants: These exert a potent and sustained decrease of skin reactivity to histamine which may last for a few weeks.
                        Beta2 Agonists: Oral terbutaline and parenteral ephedrine, in general, have been shown to decrease allergen induced wheal.
                        Dopamine: Intravenous infusion of dopamine may inhibit skin test responses.
                        Beta Blocking Agents: Propranolol can significantly increase skin test reactivity (See WARNINGS).
                        Other Drugs: Short acting steroids, inhaled beta2 agonists,  theophylline and cromolyn do not seem to affect skin test response.
