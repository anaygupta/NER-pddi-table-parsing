                           Because Thymoglobulin is administered to patients receiving a standard immunosuppressive regimen, this may predispose patients to overimmunosuppression. Many transplant centers decrease maintenance immunosuppression therapy during the period of antibody therapy.
                            Thymoglobulin can stimulate the production of antibodies which crossreact with rabbit immune globulins (See
