                           Effects of other drugs on M.V.I.-Adult:

                              Hydralazine, Isoniazid: Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements (7.2)
                           
                              •
                              Phenytoin: May decrease folic acid concentrations (7.2) 
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Effect of M.V.I.-Adult on Other Drugs
                     
                        
                           Phenytoin: Folic acid may increase phenytoin metabolism and lower the serum concentration of phenytoin resulting in increased seizure activity.
                        
                           Methotrexate: Folic acid may decrease a patient’s response to methotrexate therapy.
                        
                           Levodopa: Pyridoxine may increase the metabolism of levodopa (decrease blood level of levodopa) and decrease its efficacy.
                        
                           Antibiotics: Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease antibiotic activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin.
                        
                           Bleomycin: Ascorbic acid and riboflavin inactivate bleomycin in vitro, thus the activity of bleomycin may be reduced. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Effect of Other Drugs on M.V.I.-Adult 
                     
                        
                           Hydralazine or Isoniazid: 
                        
                        Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements. 
                        
                           Chloramphenicol:
                        
                        In patients with pernicious anemia, the hematologic response to vitamin B12 therapy may be inhibited by concomitant administration of chloramphenicol.
                        
                           Phenytoin:
                        
                        Phenytoin may decrease serum folic acid concentrations.
