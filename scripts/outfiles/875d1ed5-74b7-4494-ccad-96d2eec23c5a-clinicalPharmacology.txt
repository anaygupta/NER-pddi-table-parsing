                        Mechanisms of Action
                     
                  
                  
              Diltiazem inhibits the influx of calcium (Ca2+) ions during membrane depolarization of cardiac and vascular
              smooth muscle. The therapeutic benefits of diltiazem in supraventricular
              tachycardias are related to its ability to slow AV nodal conduction
              time and prolong AV nodal refractoriness. Diltiazem exhibits frequency
              (use) dependent effects on AV nodal conduction such that it may selectively
              reduce the heart rate during tachycardias involving the AV node with
              little or no effect on normal AV nodal conduction at normal heart
              rates.
            
                  
              Diltiazem slows the ventricular rate
              in patients with a rapid ventricular response during atrial fibrillation
              or atrial flutter. Diltiazem converts paroxysmal supraventricular
              tachycardia (PSVT) to normal sinus rhythm by interrupting the reentry
              circuit in AV nodal reentrant tachycardias and reciprocating tachycardias,
              e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW).
            
                  
              Diltiazem prolongs the sinus cycle length. It has no effect on the
              sinus node recovery time or on the sinoatrial conduction time in patients
              without SA nodal dysfunction. Diltiazem has no significant electrophysiologic
              effects on tissues in the heart that are fast sodium channel dependent,
              e.g., His-Purkinje tissue, atrial and ventricular muscle, and extranodal
              accessory pathways.
            
                  
              Like other calcium channel
              antagonists, because of its effect on vascular smooth muscle, diltiazem
              decreases total peripheral resistance resulting in a decrease in both
              systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
            
                  
                     
                        Hemodynamics  
                     
                  
                  
              In
              patients with cardiovascular disease, diltiazem hydrochloride injection
              administered intravenously in single bolus doses, followed in some
              cases by a continuous infusion, reduced blood pressure, systemic vascular
              resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance
              and increased coronary blood flow. In a limited number of studies
              of patients with compromised myocardium (severe congestive heart failure,
              acute myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), administration
              of intravenous diltiazem produced no significant effect on contractility,
              left ventricular end diastolic pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge
              pressure. The mean ejection fraction and cardiac output/index remained
              unchanged or increased. Maximal hemodynamic effects usually occurred
              within 2 to 5 minutes of an injection. However, in rare instances,
              worsening of congestive heart failure has been reported in patients
              with preexisting impaired ventricular function.
            
                  
                     
                        Pharmacodynamics  
                     
                  
                  
              The prolongation of PR interval correlated significantly
              with plasma diltiazem concentration in normal volunteers using the
              Sigmoidal Emax model. Changes in heart rate, systolic blood
              pressure, and diastolic blood pressure did not correlate with diltiazem
              plasma concentrations in normal volunteers. Reduction in mean arterial
              pressure correlated linearly with diltiazem plasma concentration in
              a group of hypertensive patients.
            
                  
              In patients
              with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, a significant correlation
              was observed between the percent reduction in HR and plasma diltiazem
              concentration using the Sigmoidal Emax model. Based on
              this relationship, the mean plasma diltiazem concentration required
              to produce a 20% decrease in heart rate was determined to be 80 ng/mL.
              Mean plasma diltiazem concentrations of 130 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL were
              determined to produce reductions in heart rate of 30% and 40%.
            
                  
                     
                        Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
                     
                  
                  
              Following a single intravenous injection in
              healthy male volunteers, diltiazem hydrochloride appears to obey linear
              pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 10.5 to 21 mg. The plasma elimination
              half-life is approximately 3.4 hours. The apparent volume of distribution
              of diltiazem is approximately 305 L. Diltiazem is extensively metabolized
              in the liver with a systemic clearance of approximately 65 L/h.
            
                  
              After constant rate intravenous infusion to healthy male
              volunteers, diltiazem exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics over an
              infusion range of 4.8 to 13.2 mg/h for 24 hours. Over this infusion
              range, as the dose is increased, systemic clearance decreases from
              64 to 48 L/h while the plasma elimination half-life increases from
              4.1 to 4.9 hours. The apparent volume of distribution remains unchanged
              (360 to 391 L). In patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter,
              diltiazem systemic clearance has been found to be decreased compared
              to healthy volunteers. In patients administered bolus doses ranging
              from 2.5 mg to 38.5 mg, systemic clearance averaged 36 L/h. In patients
              administered continuous infusions at 10 mg/h or 15 mg/h for 24 hours,
              diltiazem systemic clearance averaged 42 L/h and 31 L/h, respectively.
            
                  
              Based on the results of pharmacokinetic studies in healthy
              volunteers administered different 
                        oral 
                     diltiazem hydrochloride formulations, constant rate
              intravenous infusions of diltiazem hydrochloride at 3, 5, 7, and 11
              mg/h are predicted to produce steady-state plasma diltiazem concentrations
              equivalent to 120-, 180-, 240-, and 360-mg total daily oral doses
              of diltiazem hydrochloride tablets or diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release
              capsules.
            
                  
              After oral administration, diltiazem
              undergoes extensive metabolism in man by deacetylation, N-demethylation,
              and O-demethylation via cytochrome P-450 (oxidative metabolism) in
              addition to conjugation. Metabolites N-monodesmethyldiltiazem, desacetyldiltiazem,
              desacetyl-N-monodesmethyldiltiazem, desacetyl-O-desmethyldiltiazem,
              and desacetyl-N, O-desmethyldiltiazem have been identified in human
              urine. Following oral administration, 2% to 4% of the unchanged diltiazem
              appears in the urine. Drugs which induce or inhibit hepatic microsomal
              enzymes may alter diltiazem disposition.
            
                  
              Following
              single intravenous injection of diltiazem, however, plasma concentrations
              of N-monodesmethyldiltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem, two principal
              metabolites found in plasma after oral administration, are typically
              not detected. These metabolites are observed, however, following 24
              hour constant rate intravenous infusion. Total radioactivity measurement
              following short IV administration in healthy volunteers suggests the
              presence of other unidentified metabolites which attain higher concentrations
              than those of diltiazem and are more slowly eliminated; half-life
              of total radioactivity is about 20 hours compared to 2 to 5 hours
              for diltiazem.
            
                  
              Diltiazem hydrochloride is 70%
              to 80% bound to plasma proteins. 
                        
                In vitro
              
                     studies suggest alpha1−acid glycoprotein
              binds approximately 40% of the drug at clinically significant concentrations.
              Albumin appears to bind approximately 30% of the drug, while other
              constituents bind the remaining bound fraction. Competitive 
                        in vitro 
                     ligand binding studies have
              shown that diltiazem binding is not altered by therapeutic concentrations
              of digoxin, phenytoin, hydrochlorothiazide, indomethacin, phenylbutazone,
              propranolol, salicylic acid, tolbutamide, or warfarin.
            
                  
              Renal insufficiency, or even end-stage renal disease,
              does not appear to influence diltiazem disposition following 
                        oral 
                     administration. Liver cirrhosis
              was shown to reduce diltiazem’s apparent 
                        oral  
                     clearance and prolong its
              half-life.
