                        Although the exact mode of action for salicylic acid in the treatment of warts is unknown, its activity appears to be associated with its keratolytic action, which results in mechanical removal of epidermal cells infected with wart viruses.
                        The virucidal complex incorporated into Virasalâ€™s proprietary vehicle is designed to help reduce risk of reinfection at the wart site, as well as prevent viral contamination of the product under normal usage.
