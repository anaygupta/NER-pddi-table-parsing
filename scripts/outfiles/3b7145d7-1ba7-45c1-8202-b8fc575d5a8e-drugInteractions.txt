                     7.1 Antiglaucoma Agents
                     
                        Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. Use of dicyclomine hydrochloride in patients with glaucoma is not recommended [see Contraindications (4)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Other Drugs with Anticholinergic Activity
                     
                        The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs including dicyclomine hydrochloride: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of Class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs having anticholinergic activity.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Other Gastrointestinal Motility Drugs
                     
                        Interaction with other gastrointestinal motility drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Effect of Antacids
                     
                        Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents including dicyclomine hydrochloride, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Effect on Absorption of Other Drugs
                     
                        Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs by affecting on gastrointestinal motility, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum digoxin concentration may result.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6 Effect on Gastric Acid Secretion
                     
                        The inhibiting effects of anticholinergic drugs on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion.
