                  No studies of interactions of KRYSTEXXA with other drugs have been conducted. 
                  Because anti-pegloticase antibodies appear to bind to the PEG portion of the drug, there may be potential for binding with other PEGylated products. The impact of anti-PEG antibodies on patientsâ€™ responses to other PEG-containing therapeutics is unknown.
