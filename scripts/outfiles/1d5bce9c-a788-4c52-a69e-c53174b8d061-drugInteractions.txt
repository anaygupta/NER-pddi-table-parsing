                  For the concurrent therapy of either cyclosporine, fibrates, niacin (nicotinic acid), or erythromycin, the risk of myopathy increases [see 
                        Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                      and 
                        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)

                           Fibrates: use with fibrate products may increase the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. (2.4, 5.1)
                           Cyclosporine: combination increases exposure. Limit pravastatin to 20 mg once daily. (2.5, 7.1)
                           Clarithromycin: combination increases exposure. Limit pravastatin to 40 mg once daily. (2.6, 7.2)

                        The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of cyclosporine. Limit pravastatin to 20 mg once daily for concomitant use with cyclosporine [see 
                              Dosage and Administration (2.5)

                        The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of clarithromycin. Limit pravastatin to 40 mg once daily for concomitant use with clarithromycin [see
