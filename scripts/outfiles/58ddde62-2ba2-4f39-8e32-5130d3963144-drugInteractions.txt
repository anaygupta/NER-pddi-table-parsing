                        Patients receiving narcotics, antihistamines, antipsychotics, antianxiety agents or other Central Nervous System (CNS) depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide syrup may exhibit an additive CNS depression. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. The use of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.
