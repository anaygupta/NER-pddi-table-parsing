                           Heparin: Allow sufficient time for heparin’s effect on aPTT to decrease before initiating argatroban injection therapy (7.1).
                           Warfarin: Concomitant use results in increased prolongation of PT and INR (7.2).
                           Thrombolytic agents or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists: Safety and effectiveness of concomitant use with argatroban have not been established (7.4, 7.5).

                        If argatroban is to be initiated after cessation of heparin therapy, allow sufficient time for heparin’s effect on the aPTT to decrease prior to initiation of argatroban therapy.

                        Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between argatroban and warfarin (7.5 mg single oral dose) have not been demonstrated.  However, the concomitant use of argatroban and warfarin (5 to 7.5 mg initial oral dose, followed by 2.5 to 6 mg/day orally for 6 to 10 days) results in prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)
