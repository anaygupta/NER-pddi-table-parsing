                  Lactated Ringerâ€™s Irrigation is useful as an irrigating fluid for body joints because it approximates the electrolyte composition of synovial fluid, and provides a transparent fluid medium with optical properties suitable for good visualization of the interior joint surface during endoscopic examination. During arthroscopic surgical procedures, the solution acts as a lavage for removing blood, tissue fragments, and bone fragments.
