                     Morphine is a pure opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other
members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, and hydrocodone. Pharmacological
effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of
relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, cough suppression,
and analgesia. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses
there is increasing analgesia, unlike with mixed agonist/antagonists or
non-opioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the analgesic effect with
increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined
maximum dose; the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side
effects, the more serious which may include somnolence and respiratory
depression.
