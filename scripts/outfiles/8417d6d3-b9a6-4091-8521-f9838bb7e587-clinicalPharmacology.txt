                  The mode of action of allergenic extracts is still under investigation. The pharmacological action of allergenic extracts used diagnostically is based on the liberation of histamine and other substances when the allergen reacts with IgE antibodies attached to the mast cells.(11) The pharmacological action of allergenic extracts used for immunotherapy is based on an increase of IgG antibodies and allergen-specific T lymphocyte cells.
