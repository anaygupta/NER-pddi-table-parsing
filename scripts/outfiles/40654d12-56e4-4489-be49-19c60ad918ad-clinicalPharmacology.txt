                  Hydrocortisone is a naturally occurring glucocorticoid (adrenal corticosteroid) similar to its acetate and sodium hemisuccinate derivatives, is partially absorbed following rectal administration. Absorption studies in ulcerative colitis patients have shown up to 50% absorption of hydrocortisone administered as Hydrocortisone Rectal Suspension, USP and up to 30% of hydrocortisone acetate administered in an identical vehicle.
                  Hydrocortisone Rectal Suspension, USP provides the potent anti-inflammatory effect of hydrocortisone. Because this drug is absorbed from the colon, it acts both topically and systemically. Although rectal hydrocortisone, used as recommended for Hydrocortisone Rectal Suspension, USP, has a low incidence of reported adverse reactions, prolonged use presumably may cause systemic reactions associated with oral dosage forms.
