                  Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate is rapidly converted to active clindamycin.
                          
                     By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum levels of active clindamycin are reached.  Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears rapidly from the serum; the average elimination half-life is 6 minutes; however, the serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2 1⁄2 hours in pediatric patients.
                  After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak levels of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum level curves may be constructed from IV peak serum levels as given in Table 1 by application of elimination half-lives listed above. 
                  Serum levels of clindamycin can be maintained above the 
                        in vitro
                      minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion.  An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose.  
                  The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function.  Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules need not be modified in the presence of mild or moderate renal or hepatic disease.
                  No significant levels of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges.  
                  Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61 to 79 years) and younger adults (18 to 39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate.  After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4 hours (range 3.4 to 5.1 h) in the elderly compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1 to 4.2 h) in younger adults.  The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function.1
                  
                  Serum assays for active clindamycin require an inhibitor to prevent 
                        in vitro
                      hydrolysis of clindamycin phosphate.

                              Disk diffusion technique
                            – Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters give the most precise estimates of antibiotic susceptibility.  One such procedure2 has been recommended for use with disks to test susceptibility to clindamycin.
                        Reports from a laboratory using the standardized single-disk susceptibility test1 and a 2 mcg clindamycin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria: 
                        Susceptible organisms produce zones of 17 mm or greater, indicating that the tested organism is likely to respond to therapy. 
                        Organisms of intermediate susceptibility produce zones of 15 to 16 mm, indicating that the tested organism would be susceptible if a high dosage is used or if the infection is confined to tissues and fluids (e.g., urine), in which high antibiotic levels are attained. 
                        Resistant organisms produce zones of 14 mm or less, indicating that other therapy should be selected.
                        Standardized procedures require the use of control organisms.  The 2 mcg clindamycin disk should give a zone diameter between 24 and 30 mm for

                              Dilution techniques
                            – A bacterial isolate may be considered susceptible if the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for clindamycin is not more than 1.6 mcg/mL.  Organisms are considered moderately susceptible if the MIC is greater than 1.6 mcg/mL and less than or equal to 4.8 mcg/mL.  Organisms are considered resistant if the MIC is greater than 4.8 mcg per mL.
                        The range of MICs for the control strains are as follows:

                            ATCC 29212, 4–16 mcg/mL. 
                        For anaerobic bacteria the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clindamycin can be determined by agar dilution and broth dilution (including microdilution) techniques.3  If MICs are not determined routinely, the disk broth method is recommended for routine use.  THE KIRBY-BAUER DISK DIFFUSION METHOD AND ITS INTERPRETIVE STANDARDS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ANAEROBES.
