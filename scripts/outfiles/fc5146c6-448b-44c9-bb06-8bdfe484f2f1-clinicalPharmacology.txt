                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Balsalazide is a prodrug of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid, 5-ASA).  The mechanism of action of 5-ASA is unknown, but appears to be local to the colonic mucosa rather than systemic.  Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites in the colon.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Following oral administration, balsalazide is cleaved by azoreductases produced by anaerobic bacteria found in the gut, to release equimolar quantities of 5-ASA, the active moiety, and 4‑aminobenzoyl‑ß‑alanine (4-ABA), a carrier moiety.  Both of these moieties are N‑acetylated to form N-Ac-5-ASA and N-Ac-4-ABA, respectively.
                        
                           Absorption
                        
                        After single-dose administration of 3.3 g GIAZO in 18 healthy subjects, the median time of peak plasma concentration (Tmax) was 0.5 hr for balsalazide, while the median Tmax was 12 hr for both 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA (Table 2).  Pharmacokinetic parameters exhibited high variability, with %CV ranging from 31% to 67% for AUC and from 27% to 68% for Cmax.
                        Pharmacokinetics were also estimated in healthy volunteers after repeated doses of 3.3 g GIAZO tablets every 12 hours for 7 days.  After multiple doses, steady-state was achieved after about 3 days for balsalazide and all metabolites.  The AUC and Cmax were the highest for N‑Ac-5-ASA, followed by 5-ASA and balsalazide.  There was minimal accumulation of balsalazide, as suggested by a 1.2-fold increase in AUC; however, a relatively larger increase in the systemic exposure to metabolites was observed at steady-state.  The accumulation ratios based on AUC for the metabolites were 6.1 for 5-ASA, 3.6 for N-Ac-5-ASA, 4.8 for 4‑ABA, and 3.6 for N-Ac-4-ABA.

                           Food effect
                        
                        After administration of single dose of 3.3 g (3 × 1.1 g tablets) of GIAZO with a high-fat meal in healthy volunteers, the AUC of balsalazide was unaffected compared to fasted administration, but the presence of food reduced both peak concentrations and AUC of the metabolites 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA.  A high fat meal increased the median Tmax for balsalazide from 0.5 to 2 hours; for 5‑ASA from 12 to 24 hours; and for N-Ac-5-ASA from 12 to 24 hours.  Under fed conditions, the mean Cmax was reduced by 44% for balsalazide, 65% for 5‑ASA, and 48% for N-Ac-5-ASA.  No significant changes were observed for AUC0‑∞ for balsalazide; however, AUC0‑∞ was reduced for 5-ASA by 46% and for N-Ac-5-ASA by 17%.
                        
                           Distribution
                        
                        The binding of balsalazide to human plasma proteins was ≥ 99%; 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were 43% and 78% bound, respectively, to plasma proteins.
                        
                           Metabolism and Excretion
                        
                        Following oral administration, balsalazide is cleaved by bacterial azoreduction to release equimolar quantities of 5-ASA, the active moiety, and 4-ABA, a carrier moiety.  Mesalamine (5-ASA) and 4-ABA are further acetylated to N-Ac-5-ASA and N-Ac-4-ABA, respectively in the intestinal mucosa and liver.  The terminal half-life was 1.9 h for balsalazide, 9.5 h for 5-ASA, and 10.5 h for N-Ac-5-ASA.
                        At steady-state following administration of repeated doses of 3.3 g GIAZO every 12 hours in healthy volunteers, the combined % of dose excreted in urine for balsalazide and its metabolites over 12 hours was 23%.  The mean % of dose excreted in urine over 12 hours was 0.16% for balsalazide, 4.6% for 5-ASA, 15.6% for N-Ac-5-ASA, 0.40% for 4-ABA, and 1.8% for N-Ac-4-ABA.
