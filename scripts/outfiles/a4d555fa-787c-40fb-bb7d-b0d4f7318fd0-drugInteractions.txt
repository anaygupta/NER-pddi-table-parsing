                        Itraconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other drugs that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Similarly, itraconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other drugs that share this metabolic pathway. Itraconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, it is recommended that the corresponding label be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Drugs that may decrease itraconazole plasma concentrations
                           
                              Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of itraconazole from itraconazole capsules. It is recommended that these drugs be used with caution when coadministered with itraconazole capsules:
                              
                                 It is recommended that itraconazole capsules be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. 
                                 It is recommended that acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of SPORANOXÂ® Capsules. 
                                 Upon coadministration, it is recommended that the antifungal activity be monitored and the itraconazole dose increased as deemed necessary.
                              
                              Coadministration of itraconazole with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of itraconazole and hydroxy-itraconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include:
                              
                                 Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole'), rifampicin
                                 Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole'), phenobarbital, phenytoin
                                 Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine
                              
                              Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with itraconazole is not recommended. It is recommended that the use of these drugs be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with itraconazole, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced itraconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, it is recommended that the antifungal activity be monitored and the itraconazole dose increased as deemed necessary.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Drugs that may increase itraconazole plasma concentrations
                           
                              Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the bioavailability of itraconazole. Examples include:
                              
                                 Antibacterials: ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin
                                 Antivirals: ritonavir-boosted darunavir, ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir, indinavir (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole'), ritonavir (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole') and telaprevir.
                              
                              It is recommended that these drugs be used with caution when coadministered with itraconazole capsules. It is recommended that patients who must take itraconazole concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of itraconazole, and the itraconazole dose be decreased as deemed necessary.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by itraconazole
                           
                              Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with itraconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with itraconazole, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Once treatment is stopped, itraconazole plasma concentrations decrease to an almost undetectable concentration within 7 to 14 days, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis or in subjects receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors, the decline in plasma concentrations may be even more gradual. This is particularly important when initiating therapy with drugs whose metabolism is affected by itraconazole.

                           Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations decreased by itraconazole
                           
                              Coadministration of itraconazole with the NSAID meloxicam may decrease the plasma concentration of meloxicam. It is recommended that meloxicam be used with caution when coadministered with itraconazole, and its effects or side effects be monitored. It is recommended that the dosage of meloxicam, if coadministered with itraconazole, be adjusted if necessary.
