                     12.1 Mechanism of Action

                     
                        The mechanism of action of LATUDA in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression is unknown. However, its efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar depression could be mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics

                     
                        LATUDA is an antagonist with high affinity binding at the dopamine D2 receptors (Ki=1 nM) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) receptors 5-HT2A (Ki=0.5 nM) and 5-HT7 (Ki=0.5 nM) receptors. It also binds with moderate affinity to the human α2C adrenergic receptors (Ki=11 nM), is a partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT1A (Ki=6.4 nM) receptors, and is an antagonist at the α2A adrenergic receptors (Ki=41 nM). LATUDA exhibits little or no affinity for histamine H1 and muscarinic M1 receptors (IC50 > 1,000 nM).

                              The effects of LATUDA on the QTc interval were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-dedicated thorough QT study in 43 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, who were treated with LATUDA doses of 120 mg daily, 600 mg daily and completed the study. The maximum mean (upper 1-sided, 95% CI) increase in baseline-adjusted QTc intervals based on individual correction method (QTcI) was 7.5 (11.7) ms and 4.6 (9.5) ms, for the 120 mg and 600 mg dose groups respectively, observed at 2 to 4 hours after dosing. In this study, there was no apparent dose (exposure)-response relationship.

                              In short-term, placebo-controlled studies in schizophrenia and bipolar depression, no post-baseline QT prolongations exceeding 500 msec were reported in patients treated with LATUDA or placebo.

                           
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics

                     
                        The activity of LATUDA is primarily due to the parent drug. The pharmacokinetics of LATUDA is dose-proportional within a total daily dose range of 20 mg to 160 mg. Steady-state concentrations of LATUDA are reached within 7 days of starting LATUDA.

                        Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) elimination half-life was 18 (7) hours.

                        
                           Absorption and Distribution: LATUDA is absorbed and reaches peak serum concentrations in approximately 1-3 hours. It is estimated that 9-19% of an administered dose is absorbed. Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution was 6173 (17.2) L. LATUDA is highly bound (~99%) to serum proteins.

                        In a food effect study, LATUDA mean Cmax and AUC were about 3-times and 2-times, respectively, when administered with food compared to the levels observed under fasting conditions. LATUDA exposure was not affected as meal size was increased from 350 to 1000 calories and was independent of meal fat content [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

                        In clinical studies, establishing the safety and efficacy of LATUDA, patients were instructed to take their daily dose with food [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

                        
                           Metabolism and Elimination: LATUDA is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4. The major biotransformation pathways are oxidative N-dealkylation, hydroxylation of norbornane ring, and S-oxidation. LATUDA is metabolized into two active metabolites (ID-14283 and ID-14326) and two major non-active metabolites (ID-20219 and ID-20220). Based on in vitro studies, LATUDA is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP4A11, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1 enzymes. Because LATUDA is not a substrate for CYP1A2, smoking is not expected to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of LATUDA.

                        Total excretion of radioactivity in urine and feces combined was approximately 89%, with about 80% recovered in feces and 9% recovered in urine, after a single dose of [14C]-labeled LATUDA.

                        Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) apparent clearance was 3902 (18.0) mL/min.
