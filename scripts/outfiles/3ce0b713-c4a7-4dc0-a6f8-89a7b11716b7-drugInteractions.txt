                  No drug interaction studies have been conducted using lamivudine and zidovudine tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Lamivudine: 
                      Zalcitabine: Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended.
                  
                     Zidovudine: 
                      Stavudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in
                     vitro. 
                  
                     Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Zidovudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine.
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
                  
 

                  
                  
                     Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP.
