                  The mechanism(s) by which azelaic acid interferes with the 
pathogenic events in rosacea are unknown.
                  
                  Pharmacokinetics:The percutaneous absorption of azelaic acid after topical 
application of FINACEA Gel, 15%, could not be reliably determined. Mean plasma 
azelaic acid concentrations in rosacea patients treated with FINACEA Gel, 15%, 
twice daily for at least 8 weeks are in the range of 42 to 63.1 ng/mL. These 
values are within the maximum concentration range of 24.0 to 90.5 ng/mL observed 
in rosacea patients treated with vehicle only. This indicates that FINACEA Gel, 
15%, does not increase plasma azelaic acid concentration beyond the range 
derived from nutrition and endogenous metabolism.
                  
                     In vitro and human data suggest negligible 
cutaneous metabolism of 3H-azelaic acid 20% cream after 
topical application. Azelaic acid is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine, but 
undergoes some ÃŸ-oxidation to shorter chain dicarboxylic acids.
