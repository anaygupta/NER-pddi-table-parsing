                     Alcohol, ethyl 
                     – Hepatotoxicity has occurred in chronic alcoholics following various dose levels (moderate to excessive) of acetaminophen.
                  
                     Anticholinergics 
                     – The onset of acetaminophen effect may be delayed or decreased slightly, but the ultimate pharmacological effect is not significantly affected by anticholinergics.
                  
                     Oral Contraceptives – Increase in glucuronidation resulting in increased plasma clearance and a decreased half-life of acetaminophen.
                  
                     Charcoal (activated) 
                     – Reduces acetaminophen absorption when administered as soon as possible after overdose.
                  
                     Beta Blockers (Propanolol) – Propanolol appears to inhibit the enzyme systems responsible for the glucuronidation and oxidation of acetaminophen. Therefore, the pharmacologic effects of acetaminophen may be increased.
                  
                     Loop Diuretics 
                     – The effects of the loop diuretic may be decreased because acetaminophen may decrease renal prostaglandin excretion and decrease plasma renin activity.
                  
                     Lamotrigine – Serum lamotrigine concentrations may be reduced, producing a decrease in therapeutic effects.
                  
                     Probenecid – Probenecid may increase the therapeutic effectiveness of acetaminophen slightly.
                  
                     Zidovudine – The pharmacologic effects of zidovudine may be decreased because of enhanced nonhepatic or renal clearance of zidovudine.
