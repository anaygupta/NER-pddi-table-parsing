AIRACOFâ„¢ may result in an additive CNS depression. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.

                        Concomitant use of antihistamines with alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates and other CNS depressants may have an additive effect.
