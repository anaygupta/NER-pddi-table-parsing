                  7.1 Drugs with pH-Dependent Absorption 
PharmacokineticsKAPIDEX causes inhibition of gastric acid secretion. KAPIDEX is 
likely to substantially decrease the systemic concentrations of the HIV protease 
inhibitor atazanavir, which is dependent upon the presence of gastric acid for 
absorption, and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect of atazanavir and the 
development of HIV resistance. Therefore, KAPIDEX should not be co-administered 
with atazanavir. 
                  It is theoretically possible that KAPIDEX may interfere with the absorption 
of other drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of oral 
bioavailability (e.g., ampicillin esters, digoxin, iron salts, 
ketoconazole).
                  
                  
                  7.2 WarfarinCo-administration of KAPIDEX 90 mg and warfarin 25 mg did not 
affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin or INR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)]. However, there have been 
reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs and 
warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to 
abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with KAPIDEX and warfarin 
concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin 
time.
