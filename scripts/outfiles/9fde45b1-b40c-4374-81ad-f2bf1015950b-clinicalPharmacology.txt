                  Cimetidine competitively inhibits the action of histamine at the 
histamine H2 receptors of the parietal cells and thus is 
a histamine H2-receptor antagonist.
                  Cimetidine is not an anticholinergic agent. Studies have shown that 
cimetidine inhibits both daytime and nocturnal basal gastric acid secretion. 
Cimetidine also inhibits gastric acid secretion stimulated by food, histamine, 
pentagastrin, caffeine and insulin.

                        1) Acid Secretion
                        NocturnalCimetidine 800 mg orally at bedtime reduces mean hourly H+ activity by greater than 85% over an eight-hour period in 
duodenal ulcer patients, with no effect on daytime acid secretion. Cimetidine 
1600 mg orally h.s. produces 100% inhibition of mean hourly H+ activity over an eight-hour period in duodenal ulcer 
patients, but also reduces H+ activity by 35% for an 
additional five hours into the following morning. Cimetidine 400 mg b.i.d. and 
300 mg q.i.d. decrease nocturnal acid secretion in a dose-related manner, i.e., 
47%â€“83% over a six- to eight-hour period and 54% over a nine-hour period, 
respectively.
                        
                        Food StimulatedDuring the first hour after a standard experimental meal, oral 
cimetidine 300 mg inhibited gastric acid secretion in duodenal ulcer patients by 
at least 50%. During the subsequent two hours cimetidine inhibited gastric acid 
secretion by at least 75%.
                        The effect of a 300 mg breakfast dose of cimetidine continued for at least 
four hours and there was partial suppression of the rise in gastric acid 
secretion following the luncheon meal in duodenal ulcer patients. This 
suppression of gastric acid output was enhanced and could be maintained by 
another 300 mg dose of cimetidine given with lunch.
                        In another study, cimetidine 300 mg given with the meal increased gastric pH 
as compared with placebo.
                        


                        



                        24-Hour Mean H+ ActivityCimetidine 800 mg h.s., 400 mg b.i.d. and 300 mg q.i.d. all 
provide a similar, moderate (less than 60%) level of 24-hour acid suppression. 
However, the 800 mg h.s. regimen exerts its entire effect on nocturnal acid, and 
does not affect daytime gastric physiology.
                        
                        Chemically StimulatedOral cimetidine significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion 
stimulated by betazole (an isomer of histamine), pentagastrin, caffeine and 
insulin as follows:
                        


                        


When food and betazole were used to stimulate secretion, inhibition of 
hydrogen ion concentration usually ranged from 45% to 75% and the inhibition of 
volume ranged from 30% to 65%.
                        
                        2) PepsinOral cimetidine 300 mg reduced total pepsin output as a result of 
the decrease in volume of gastric juice.
                        
                        3) Intrinsic FactorIntrinsic factor secretion was studied with betazole as a 
stimulant. Oral cimetidine 300 mg inhibited the rise in intrinsic factor 
concentration produced by betazole, but some intrinsic factor was secreted at 
all times.

pressure or the rate of gastric emptying.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Cimetidine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and peak 
levels occur in 45 to 90 minutes. The half-life of cimetidine is approximately 2 
hours. Both oral and parenteral (I.V. or I.M.) administration provide comparable 
periods of therapeutically effective blood levels; blood concentrations remain 
above that required to provide 80% inhibition of basal gastric acid secretion 
for 4 to 5 hours following a dose of 300 mg.
                        The principal route of excretion of cimetidine is the urine. Following 
parenteral administration, most of the drug is excreted as the parent compound; 
following oral administration, the drug is more extensively metabolized, the 
sulfoxide being the major metabolite. Following a single oral dose, 48% of the 
drug is recovered from the urine after 24 hours as the parent compound. 
Following IV or IM administration, approximately 75% of the drug is recovered 
from the urine after 24 hours as the parent compound.
