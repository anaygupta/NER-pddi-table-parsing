               Phenobarbital is a barbiturate, nonselective central nervous system depressant which is primarily used as a sedative hypnotic and also as an anticonvulsant in subhypnotic doses.  Atropine Sulfate, Hyoscyamine Sulfate and Scopolamine Hydrobromide are belladonna alkaloids classified as anticholinergic, antimuscarinic drugs and act to inhibit muscarinic actions of acetylcholine at postganglionic parasympathetic neuron effector sites.  These drugs are also used as antispasmodics due to their anticholinergic action and produce the effect in the body of reduced muscle spasms in the digestive or urinary tract, and reduced fluid secretions from certain glands or organs.  This drug combination provides peripheral anticholinergic/antispasmodic action and mild sedation.
