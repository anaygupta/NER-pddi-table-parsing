                  NATURALLY OCCURRING GLUCOCORTICOIDS (HYDROCORTISONE AND CORTISONE), WHICH ALSO HAVE SALT-RETAINING PROPERTIES, ARE USED AS REPLACEMENT THERAPY IN ADRENOCORTICAL DEFICIENCY STATES. PREDNISOLONE IS PRIMARILY USED FOR ITS POTENT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS IN DISORDERS OF MANY ORGAN SYSTEMS. GLUCOCORTICOIDS CAUSE PROFOUND AND VARIED METABOLIC EFFECTS. IN ADDITION, THEY MODIFY THE BODY'S IMMUNE RESPONSES TO DIVERSE STIMULI.
