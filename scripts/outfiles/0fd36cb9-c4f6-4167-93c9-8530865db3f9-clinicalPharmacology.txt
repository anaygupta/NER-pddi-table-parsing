	Mechanism of Action
                     
                     
                        Aranesp stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as endogenous erythropoietin.

	Pharmacokinetics
                     
                     
                        
                           Adult Patients
                            with CKD
                        
                        The pharmacokinetics of Aranesp were studied in patients with CKD receiving or not receiving dialysis and patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy.
                        Following intravenous administration of Aranesp to patients with CKD receiving dialysis, Aranesp serum concentration-time profiles were biphasic, with a distribution half-life of approximately 1.4 hours and a mean terminal half-life (t1/2) of 21 hours.  The t1/2 of Aranesp was approximately 3-fold longer than that of epoetin alfa when administered intravenously.
                        Following subcutaneous administration of Aranesp to patients with CKD (receiving or not receiving dialysis), absorption was slow and Cmax occurred at 48 hours (range: 12 to 72 hours).  In patients with CKD receiving dialysis, the average t1/2 was 46 hours (range: 12 to 89 hours), and in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis, the average t1/2 was 70 hours (range: 35 to 139 hours).  Aranesp apparent clearance was approximately 1.4 times faster on average in patients receiving dialysis compared to patients not receiving dialysis.  The bioavailability of Aranesp in patients with CKD receiving dialysis after subcutaneous administration was 37% (range: 30% to 50%).
                        
                           Pediatric Patients
                            
                           with CKD
                        
                        Aranesp pharmacokinetics was evaluated in 12 pediatric patients (age 3 to 16 years) with CKD receiving or not receiving dialysis in one study (n=12).  In a phase 1 pharmacokinetic study, following a single intravenous or subcutaneous Aranesp dose, Cmax and t1/2 were similar to those obtained in adult patients with CKD on dialysis.  Additionally, following a single subcutaneous dose, the average bioavailability was 54% (range: 32% to 70%), which was higher than that obtained in adult patients with CKD on dialysis.
                        
                           Adult Patients
                            with Cancer
                        
                        Following the first subcutaneous dose of 6.75 mcg/kg (equivalent to 500 mcg for a 74-kg patient) in patients with cancer, the mean t1/2 was 74 hours (range: 24 to 144 hours) and Cmax was observed at 71 hours (range: 28 to 120 hours).  When administered on a once every 3 week schedule, 48-hour postdose Aranesp levels after the fourth dose were similar to those after the first dose.
                        Over the dose range of 0.45 to 4.5 mcg/kg Aranesp administered intravenously or subcutaneously on a once weekly schedule and 4.5 to 15 mcg/kg administered subcutaneously on a once every 3 week schedule, systemic exposure was approximately proportional to dose.  No evidence of accumulation was observed beyond an expected less than 2-fold increase in blood levels when compared to the initial dose.
