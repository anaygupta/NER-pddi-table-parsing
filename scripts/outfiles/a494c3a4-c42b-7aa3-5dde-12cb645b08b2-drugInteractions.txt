                  No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid and tissue plasminogen activators.

                     7.1 Hormonal Contraceptives
                     
                        Because tranexamic acid is antifibrinolytic, concomitant use of hormonal contraception and tranexamic acid may further exacerbate the increased thrombotic risk associated with combination hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid with combination hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Tissue Plasminogen Activators
                     
                        Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid and tissue plasminogen activators. Therefore, exercise caution if a woman taking tranexamic acid therapy requires tissue plasminogen activators. 
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates
                     
                        Tranexamic acid is not recommended for women taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin)
                     
                        Exercise caution when prescribing tranexamic acid to women with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
