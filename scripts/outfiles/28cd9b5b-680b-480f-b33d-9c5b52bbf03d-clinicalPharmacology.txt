                        The mechanism of action of ZYCLARA Cream in treating AK and EGW lesions is unknown.

                        The pharmacodynamics of ZYCLARA Cream are unknown.
                        Imiquimod is a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist that activates immune cells. Topical application to skin is associated with increases in markers for cytokines and immune cells.

                              In a study of 18 subjects with AK comparing imiquimod cream, 5% to vehicle, increases from baseline in week 2 biomarker levels were reported for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11c, and CD68 for imiquimod cream, 5% treated subjects; however, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Following dosing with 2 packets of ZYCLARA Cream, 3.75% once daily (18.75 mg imiquimod/day) for up to three weeks, systemic absorption of imiquimod was observed in all subjects when ZYCLARA Cream was applied to the face and/or scalp in 17 subjects with at least 10 AK lesions. The mean peak serum imiquimod concentration at the end of the trial was approximately 0.323 ng/mL. The median time to maximal concentrations (Tmax) occurred at 9 hours after dosing. Based on the plasma half-life of imiquimod observed at the end of the study, 29.3±17.0 hours, steady-state concentrations can be anticipated to occur by day 7 with once daily dosing.
                        Systemic absorption of imiquimod (up to 9.4 mg [one packet]) across the affected skin of 18 subjects with EGW was observed with once daily dosing for 3 weeks in all subjects. The subjects had either a minimum of 8 warts (range 8–93) or a surface area involvement of greater than 100mm2 (range 15–620mm2) at study entry. The mean peak serum imiquimod concentration at Day 21 was 0.488 +/- 0.368 ng/mL. The median time to maximal concentrations (Tmax) occurred 12 hours after dosing. Based on the plasma half-life of imiquimod observed at the end of the study, 24.1+/- 12.4 hours, steady-state concentrations can be anticipated to occur by day 7 with once daily dosing. Because of the small number of subjects present (13 males, 5 females) it was not possible to select out or do an analysis of absorption based on gender/site of application.
