               Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that exerts anxiolytic, sedative, muscle-relaxant, 
anticonvulsant and amnestic effects. Most of these effects are thought to result 
from a facilitation of the action of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an 
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.
