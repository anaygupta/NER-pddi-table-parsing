                  In the absence of specific studies in children, the drug interactions with propranolol are those known in adults. Consider both the infant’s medications and those of a nursing mother.
                  
                     Pharmacokinetic drug interactions
                  
                  
                     Impact of co-administered drugs on propranolol: CYP2D6, CYP1A2 or CYP2C19 inhibitors increase propranolol plasma concentration. CYP1A2 inducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital) or CYP2C19 inducers (rifampin) decrease propranolol plasma concentration when co-administered. 
                  
                     Pharmacodynamic drug interactions
                  
                  
                     Corticosteroids: Patients on corticosteroids may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia because of loss of the counter-regulatory cortisol response; monitor patients for signs of hypoglycemia.
