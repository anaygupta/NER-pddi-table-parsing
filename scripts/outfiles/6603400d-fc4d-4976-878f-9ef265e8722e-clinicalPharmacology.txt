                  Sodium chloride comprises over 90% of the inorganic constituents of the blood serum. Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Clâ€“) ions. These ions are normal constituents of the body fluids (principally extracellular) and are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance. The small volume of fluid and amount of sodium chloride provided by Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 0.9%, when used only as a vehicle for parenteral injection of drugs, is unlikely to exert a significant effect on fluid and electrolyte balance except possibly in very small infants.
