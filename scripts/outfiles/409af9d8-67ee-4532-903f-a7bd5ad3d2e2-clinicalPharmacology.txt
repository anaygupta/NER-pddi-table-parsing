                  Nifedipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow-channel 
blocker or calcium ion antagonist) which inhibits the transmembrane influx of 
calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The contractile 
processes of vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle are dependent upon the 
movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion 
channels. Nifedipine selectively inhibits calcium ion influx across the cell 
membrane of vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle without altering serum 
calcium concentrations.
