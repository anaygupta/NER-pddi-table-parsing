                           Absorption:  Following oral administration of Alinia Tablets or Oral Suspension, maximum plasma concentrations of the active metabolites tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are observed within 1-4 hours.  The parent nitazoxanide is not detected in plasma.  Pharmacokinetic parameters of tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below.

                        



                        


Alinia for Oral Suspension is not bioequivalent to Alinia Tablets. The relative bioavailability of the suspension compared to the tablet was 70%.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           Effect of Food: When Alinia Tablets are administered with food, the AUCt of tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide in plasma is increased almost two-fold and the Cmax is increased by almost 50%.

                        When Alinia for Oral Suspension was administered with food, the AUCt of tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide increased by about 45-50% and the Cmax increased by â‰¤10%.

                        Alinia Tablets and for Oral Suspension were administered with food in clinical trials and hence they are recommended to be administered with food (see 
                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                           ).

                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Multiple dosing:  Following oral administration of a single Alinia Tablet every 12 hours for 7 consecutive days, there was no significant accumulation of nitazoxanide metabolites tizoxanide or tizoxanide glucuronide detected in plasma.

                           
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           Distribution:  In plasma, more than 99% of tizoxanide is bound to proteins.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           Metabolism: Following oral administration in humans, nitazoxanide is rapidly hydrolyzed to an active metabolite, tizoxanide (desacetyl-nitazoxanide).  Tizoxanide then undergoes conjugation, primarily by glucuronidation.  In vitro metabolism studies have demonstrated that tizoxanide has no significant inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           Elimination:  Tizoxanide is excreted in the urine, bile and feces, and tizoxanide glucuronide is excreted in urine and bile. Approximately two-thirds of the oral dose of nitazoxanide is excreted in the feces and one-third in the urine.
