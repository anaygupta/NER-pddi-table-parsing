                        Extra hepatic effects of glucagon include relaxation of the smooth muscle of the stomach, small bowel, and colon.

                           Absorption
                        
                        Following intramuscular administration of 1 mg dose, the maximum plasma glucagon concentrations of 3391 pg/mL were attained approximately 10 minutes after dosing. 
                        

                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        The mean apparent half-life of glucagon was 26 minutes after intramuscular administration. 
                        

                        Glucagon is degraded in the liver, kidney, and plasma.
