                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        
                           Azor. Azor is a combination of two 
antihypertensive drugs: a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion 
antagonist or slow-channel blocker), amlodipine besylate, and an angiotensin II 
receptor blocker, olmesartan medoxomil. The amlodipine component of Azor 
inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle 
and cardiac muscle, and the olmesartan medoxomil component of Azor blocks the 
vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II.
                        
                        
                        
                           Amlodipine. Experimental data 
suggests that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nonhydropyridine 
binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth 
muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these 
cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx 
across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth 
muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be 
detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen 
in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not 
affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an 
ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel 
receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with 
the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.
                        Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on 
vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance 
and reduction in blood pressure.
                        
                        
                        
                           Olmesartan medoxomil. Angiotensin 
II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin 
converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor 
agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include 
vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac 
stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the 
vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of 
angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in vascular smooth 
muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II 
synthesis.
                        An AT2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but 
this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. 
Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 
receptor.
                        Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit 
the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is a mechanism of many 
drugs used to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of 
bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because olmesartan does not 
inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. 
Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known.
                        Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory 
feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased 
plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the 
effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        
                           Amlodipine. Following 
administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine 
produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood 
pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a 
significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic 
dosing.
                        With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness 
is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect 
in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure 
with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; 
thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105-114 mmHg) 
had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic 
pressure 90-104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically 
significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg).
                        In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of 
amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase 
in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in 
filtration fraction or proteinuria.
                        As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac 
function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal 
ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small 
increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left 
ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine 
has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in 
the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered 
with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in 
normals or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing 
significant negative inotropic effects.
                        Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular 
conduction in intact animals or man. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was 
administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either 
hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters 
were observed.
                        
                        
                        
                           Olmesartan medoxomil. Olmesartan 
medoxomil doses of 2.5 mg to 40 mg inhibit the pressor effects of angiotensin I 
infusion. The duration of the inhibitory effect was related to dose, with doses 
of olmesartan medoxomil >40 mg giving >90% inhibition at 24 hours.
                        Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin 
activity (PRA) increase after single and repeated administration of olmesartan 
medoxomil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Repeated administration 
of up to 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil had minimal influence on aldosterone levels 
and no effect on serum potassium.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil from 
Azor are equivalent to the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine and olmesartan 
medoxomil when administered separately. The bioavailability of both components 
is well below 100%, but neither component is affected by food. The effective 
half-lives of amlodipine (45±11 hours) and olmesartan (7±1 hours) result in a 2- 
to 3- fold accumulation for amlodipine and negligible accumulation for 
olmesartan with once-daily dosing.
                        
                        
                        
                           Amlodipine. After oral 
administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine, absorption produces peak 
plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability is 
estimated as between 64% and 90%.
                        
                        
                        
                           Olmesartan medoxomil. Olmesartan 
medoxomil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis to 
olmesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. The absolute 
bioavailability of olmesartan medoxomil is approximately 26%. After oral 
administration, the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 
olmesartan is reached after 1 to 2 hours. Food does not affect the 
bioavailability of olmesartan medoxomil.
                        
                        
                        
                           

                           

                           Distribution
                        
                        
                        
                        
                           Amlodipine.
                            Ex 
vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is 
bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Steady-state plasma levels of 
amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.
                        
                        
                        
                           Olmesartan medoxomil. The volume 
of distribution of olmesartan is approximately 17 L. Olmesartan is highly bound 
to plasma proteins (99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein 
binding is constant at plasma olmesartan concentrations well above the range 
achieved with recommended doses.
                        In rats, olmesartan crossed the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. 
Olmesartan passed across the placental barrier in rats and was distributed to 
the fetus. Olmesartan was distributed to milk at low levels in rats.
                        
                        
                        
                           

                           

                           Metabolism and Excretion
                        
                        
                        
                        
                           Amlodipine. Amlodipine is 
extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic 
metabolism. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination 
half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Ten percent of the parent compound and 60% of 
the metabolites are excreted in the urine.
                        
                        
                        
                           Olmesartan medoxomil. Following 
the rapid and complete conversion of olmesartan medoxomil to olmesartan during 
absorption, there is virtually no further metabolism of olmesartan. Total plasma 
clearance of olmesartan is 1.3 L/h, with a renal clearance of 0.6 L/h. 
Approximately 35% to 50% of the absorbed dose is recovered in urine while the 
remainder is eliminated in feces via the bile.
                        Olmesartan appears to be eliminated in a biphasic manner with a terminal 
elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Olmesartan shows linear 
pharmacokinetics following single oral doses of up to 320 mg and multiple oral 
doses of up to 80 mg. Steady-state levels of olmesartan are achieved within 3 to 
5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with once-daily dosing.
                        
                        
                        
                           

                           

                           Geriatric
                        
                        The pharmacokinetic properties of Azor in the elderly are similar to those of 
the individual components.
                        
                        
                        
                           Amlodipine. Elderly patients have 
decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of 
approximately 40% to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required.
                        
                        
                        
                           Olmesartan medoxomil. The 
pharmacokinetics of olmesartan medoxomil were studied in the elderly (>65 
years). Overall, maximum plasma concentrations of olmesartan were similar in 
young adults and the elderly. Modest accumulation of olmesartan was observed in 
the elderly with repeated dosing; AUCѕѕ, τ was 33% higher in elderly patients, corresponding to an 
approximate 30% reduction in CLR.
                        
                        
                        
                           

                           

                           Pediatric
                        
                        
                        
                        
                           Amlodipine. Sixty-two hypertensive 
patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 
mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values 
in adults.
                        
                        
                        
                           Olmesartan medoxomil. The 
pharmacokinetics of olmesartan medoxomil have not been investigated in patients 
<18 years of age.
                        
                        
                        
                           

                           

                           Gender
                        
                        Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that female patients had 
approximately 15% smaller clearances of olmesartan than male patients. Gender 
had no effect on the clearance of amlodipine.
                        
                        
                        
                           Olmesartan medoxomil. Minor 
differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of olmesartan medoxomil in 
women compared to men. AUC and Cmax were 10% to 15% 
higher in women than in men.

                           Amlodipine. The pharmacokinetics 
of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients 
with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose.
                        
                        
                        
                           Olmesartan medoxomil. In patients 
with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of olmesartan were elevated 
compared to subjects with normal renal function. After repeated dosing, the AUC 
was approximately tripled in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance <20 mL/min). The pharmacokinetics of olmesartan medoxomil in 
patients undergoing hemodialysis has not been studied. No initial dosage 
adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <40 mL/min).

                           Amlodipine. Patients with hepatic 
insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase 
in AUC of approximately 40% to 60%.
                        
                        
                        
                           Olmesartan medoxomil. Increases in 
AUC0-∞ and Cmax were observed in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to those in matched controls, 
with an increase in AUC of about 60%.
