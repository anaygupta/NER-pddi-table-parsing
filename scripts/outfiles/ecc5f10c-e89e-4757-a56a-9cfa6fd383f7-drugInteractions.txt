                  The anticoagulant effect of heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is enhanced by antithrombin. The half-life of antithrombin may be altered by concomitant treatment with these anticoagulants due to an altered antithrombin turnover. Thus, concurrent administration of antithrombin with heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or other anticoagulants that use antithrombin to exert their anticoagulant effect must be monitored clinically and biologically. To avoid excessive anticoagulation, regular coagulation tests (aPTT, and where appropriate, anti-Factor Xa activity) are to be performed at close intervals, with adjustment in dosage of the anticoagulant as necessary.
