                        Effect of Other Drugs on TARGRETIN
                     
                  
                  Gemfibrozil: Concomitant administration of TARGRETIN and gemfibrozil resulted in increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene.  Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with TARGRETIN is not recommended.
                  
                     
                        Effect of TARGRETIN on Other Drugs
                     
                  
                  TARGRETIN may be an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4.  Drug products which may be affected include oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives. Thus, if treatment with TARGRETIN is intended for a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that a non-hormonal contraception be considered.
