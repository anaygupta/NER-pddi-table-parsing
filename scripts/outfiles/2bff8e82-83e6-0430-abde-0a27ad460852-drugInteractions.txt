                  Significant drug interactions with lamotrigine are summarized in Table 13. Additional details of these drug interaction studies are provided in the Clinical Pharmacology subsection [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                   
                  


                  


↓ = Decreased (induces lamotrigine gluronidation).
                  ↑ = Increased (inhibits lamotrigine glucuronidation).
                  ? = Conflicting data.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Valproate increases lamotrigine concentrations more than 2 fold. (7, 12.3) 
                           Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 40%. (7, 12.3) 
                           Oral estrogen-containing contraceptives and rifampin also decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 50%. (7, 12.3)
