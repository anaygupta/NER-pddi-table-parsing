                  Following intravenous injection, radioiodinated serum albumin is uniformly
                  distributed throughout the intravascular pool within 10 minutes; extravascular
                  distribution takes place more slowly. Labeled albumin also can be detected in
                  the lymph and in certain body tissues within 10 minutes after injection, but
                  maximum distribution of radioactivity throughout the extravascular space does
                  not occur until two to four days after administration. The time at which
                  extravascular activity is maximal has been designated as the "equilibrium time."
                  When this point has been reached, the radioactivity remaining in the
                  intravascular and extravascular spaces decreases slowly and exponentially in
                  parallel fashion.
                      The administered radioactivity is eliminated almost entirely in the urine, only
                  about 2 percent of the total dose ultimately appearing in the feces. The biologic
                  half-life of labeled albumin is dependent upon a number of factors, and
                  published studies have varied considerably in their reporting of this figure. It
                  has ranged, in the literature, from below 10 days to over 20 days. One important
                  factor affecting the biologic half-life is the initial rate of excretion, and this
                  depends in part on the quality of the labeled albumin. With Jeanatope 1-125 the
                  biologic half-life in normal individuals has been reported to be approximately 14 
                  days.
