                     Stavudine: Concomitant use with zidovudine should be avoided. (7.1)

                     Doxorubicin: Use with zidovudine should be avoided. (7.2)

                     Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. (7.3)

                     Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided.

                  Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine.
