               Dihydrocodeine is a semi-synthetic narcotic analgesic related to codeine, with multiple actions 
qualitatively similar to those of codeine; the most prominent of these involve the central nervous 
system and organs with smooth muscle components. Brompheniramine maleate is an alkylamine 
type antihistamine. This group of antihistamines is among the most active histamine antagonists 
and is generally effective in relatively low doses. The drugs are not so prone to produce 
drowsiness and are among the most suitable agents for daytime use, but a significant proportion 
of patients do experience this effect. Phenylephrine HCl is a sympathomimetic, which acts 
predominately on alpha-receptors and has little action on beta-receptors. It therefore functions 
as an oral nasal decongestant with minimal CNS stimulation.
