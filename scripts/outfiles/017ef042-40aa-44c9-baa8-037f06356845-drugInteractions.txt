                           CNS Depressants
                        
                        Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, general anesthetics, antiemetics, phenothiazines, or other tranquilizers or alcohol increases the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma. Use morphine sulfate with caution and in reduced dosages in patients taking these agents.
                        
                           Opioid Agonist Analgesics 
                        
                        Pentazocine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride can antagonize the effects of a pure opioid agonist analgesic and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.
                        
                           Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) 
                        
                        Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with pentazocine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride may cause CNS excitation and hypertension through their respective effects on catecholamines. Caution should therefore be observed in administering pentazocine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride to patients who are currently receiving MAOIs or who have received them within the preceding 14 days.
                        
                           Anticholinergics 
                        
                        Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.
                        
                           Tobacco 
                        
                        Smoking tobacco could enhance the metabolic clearance rate of pentazocine reducing the clinical effectiveness of a standard dose of pentazocine.
