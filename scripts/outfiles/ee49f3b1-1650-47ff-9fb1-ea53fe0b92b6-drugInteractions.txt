                     7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with ABILIFY MAINTENA
                     
                        Based on pharmacokinetic studies with oral aripiprazole, no dosage adjustment of ABILIFY MAINTENA is required when administered concomitantly with famotidine, valproate, lithium, lorazepam [see 
                                 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)
                              ]. 
                        In addition, no dosage adjustment is necessary for substrates of CYP2D6 (e.g., dextromethorphan, fluoxetine, paroxetine, or venlafaxine), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, warfarin), or CYP3A4 (e.g., dextromethorphan) when co-administered with ABILIFY MAINTENA. Additionally, no dosage adjustment is necessary for valproate, lithium, lamotrigine, lorazepam, or sertraline when co-administered with ABILIFY MAINTENA. [see
