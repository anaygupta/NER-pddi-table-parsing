                     7.1	Propranolol
                     
                        The dose of rizatriptan benzoate  should be adjusted in propranolol-treated patients, as propranolol has been shown to increase the plasma AUC of rizatriptan by 70%  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Ergot-Containing Drugs
                     
                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and rizatriptan benzoate  within 24 hours is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3    Other 5-HT1 Agonists
                     
                        Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of rizatriptan benzoate and other 5-HT1 agonists within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4    SSRIs/SNRIs and Serotonin Syndrome
                     
                        Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5    Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
                     
                        Rizatriptan benzoate  is contraindicated in patients taking MAO-A inhibitors and non-selective MAO inhibitors. A specific MAO-A inhibitor increased the systemic exposure of rizatriptan and its metabolite [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
