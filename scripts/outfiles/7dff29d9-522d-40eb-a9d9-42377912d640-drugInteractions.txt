                        Lidocaine should be used with caution in patients with digitalis toxicity accompanied by atrioventricular block (see 
                              CONTRAINDICATIONS
                           ).
                        Coadministration of propranolol or cimetidine with lidocaine has been reported to reduce clearance from the plasma and may result in toxic accumulation of the drug (see 
                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
                           ).
                        When lidocaine is administered with other antiarrhythmic drugs such as phenytoin, procainamide, propranolol, amiodarone, or quinidine, the cardiac effects may be additive or antagonistic and toxic effects may be additive. Phenytoin may stimulate the hepatic metabolism of lidocaine, but the clinical significance of this effect is not known.
