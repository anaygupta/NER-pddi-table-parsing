                     Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        Methylphenidate hydrochloride is a mild central nervous system stimulant.
                                   
                        The mode of action in man is not completely understood, but methylphenidate hydrochloride presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its stimulant effect.
                                   
                        There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby methylphenidate hydrochloride produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system.
                        

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Effects on QT Interval
                     
                        The effect of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (dexmethylphenidate, the pharmacologically active d-enantiomer of methylphenidate) on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study following single doses of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules 40mg in 75 healthy volunteers. ECGs were collected up to 12 h post-dose. Frederica’s method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was <5 ms, and the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval was below 10 ms for all time matched comparisons versus placebo. This was below the threshold of clinical concern and there was no evident-exposure response relationship.
