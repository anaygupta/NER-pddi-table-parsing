                     7.1 Potassium-Sparing Diuretics
                     
                        Use with potassium-sparing diuretic can produce severe hyperkalemia. Avoid concomitant use.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors
                     
                        Use with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors produces potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Potassium supplements should be given to patients receiving ACE inhibitors only with close monitoring.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Angiotensin Receptor Blockers
                     
                        Use with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) produces potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Potassium supplements should be given to patients receiving ARBs only with close monitoring.
