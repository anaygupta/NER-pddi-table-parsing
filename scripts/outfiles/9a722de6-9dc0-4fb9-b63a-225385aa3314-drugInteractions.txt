                        Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of ampicillin and sulbactam. Concurrent use of probenecid with Ampicillin and Sulbactam may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam. The concurrent administration of allopurinol and aampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs aas compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation oof ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these ppatients. There are no data with Ampicillin and Sulbactam and allopurinol administered cconcurrently. Ampicillin and Sulbactam and aminoglycosides should not be reconstitute ttogether due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by the ampicillin component of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection.
