                  Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.
                  
 

                  
                  MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  
 

                  
                  Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.
                  
 

                  
                  Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
