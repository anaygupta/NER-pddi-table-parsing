                           Absorption
                           
                              Following a single oral dose of 300 mg to nine healthy adult volunteers, rifabutin was readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with mean (±SD) peak plasma levels (Cmax) of 375 (±267) ng/mL (range: 141 to 1033 ng/mL) attained in 3.3 (±0.9) hours (Tmax range: 2 to 4 hours). Absolute bioavailability assessed in five HIV-positive patients, who received both oral and intravenous doses, averaged 20%. Total recovery of radioactivity in the urine indicates that at least 53% of the orally administered rifabutin dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The bioavailability of rifabutin from the capsule dosage form, relative to an oral solution, was 85% in 12 healthy adult volunteers. High-fat meals slow the rate without influencing the extent of absorption from the capsule dosage form. Plasma concentrations post-Cmax declined in an apparent biphasic manner. Pharmacokinetic dose-proportionality was established over the 300 to 600 mg dose range in nine healthy adult volunteers (crossover design) and in 16 early symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients over a 300 to 900 mg dose range.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Distribution
                           
                              Due to its high lipophilicity, rifabutin demonstrates a high propensity for distribution and intracellular tissue uptake. Following intravenous dosing, estimates of apparent steady-state distribution volume (9.3 ± 1.5 L/kg) in five HIV-positive patients exceeded total body water by approximately 15-fold. Substantially higher intracellular tissue levels than those seen in plasma have been observed in both rat and man. The lung-to-plasma concentration ratio, obtained at 12 hours, was approximately 6.5 in four surgical patients who received an oral dose. Mean rifabutin steady-state trough levels (Cp,min
                                 ss; 24-hour post-dose) ranged from 50 to 65 ng/mL in HIV-positive patients and in healthy adult volunteers. About 85% of the drug is bound in a concentration-independent manner to plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.05 to 1 µg/mL. Binding does not appear to be influenced by renal or hepatic dysfunction. Rifabutin was slowly eliminated from plasma in seven healthy adult volunteers, presumably because of distribution-limited elimination, with a mean terminal half-life of 45 (±17) hours (range: 16 to 69 hours). Although the systemic levels of rifabutin following multiple dosing decreased by 38%, its terminal half-life remained unchanged.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Metabolism
                           
                              Of the five metabolites that have been identified, 25-O-desacetyl and 31-hydroxy are the most predominant, and show a plasma metabolite:parent area under the curve ratio of 0.10 and 0.07, respectively. The former has an activity equal to the parent drug and contributes up to 10% to the total antimicrobial activity.

                              A mass-balance study in three healthy adult volunteers with 14C-labeled rifabutin showed that 53% of the oral dose was excreted in the urine, primarily as metabolites. About 30% of the dose is excreted in the feces. Mean systemic clearance (CLs/F) in healthy adult volunteers following a single oral dose was 0.69 (±0.32) L/hr/kg (range: 0.46 to 1.34 L/hr/kg). Renal and biliary clearance of unchanged drug each contribute approximately 5% to CLs/F.

                              The disposition of rifabutin (300 mg) was studied in 18 patients with varying degrees of renal function. Area under plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increased by about 71% in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min) compared to patients with creatinine clearance (Crcl) between 61–74 mL/min. In patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Crcl between 30–61 mL/min), the AUC increased by about 41%. A reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended for patients with Crcl< 30 mL/min (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

                        Rifabutin induces the enzymes of the cytochrome P450 3A subfamily (CYP3A) and therefore may reduce the plasma concentrations of drugs that are principally metabolized by those enzymes. Rifabutin is also metabolized by CYP3A. Thus, some drugs that inhibit CYP3A may significantly increase plasma concentrations of rifabutin.

                                    Fluconazole (200 mg/day for 2 weeks) increased the AUC of rifabutin (300 mg/day for 2 weeks) by 82% and Cmax by 88% in 12 HIV-infected patients who were on zidovudine (500 mg/day) maintenance therapy (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions). Rifabutin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole.

                                    Rifabutin (300 mg/day) decreased the AUC of dapsone (50 mg/day) in HIV-infected patients (n=16) by about 27% to 40%.

When trimethoprim was given alone, the AUC of trimethoprim was decreased by 14% and the Cmax by 6%. 
                                    Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim did not alter the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin.

                                    In 7 HIV-infected patients, rifabutin (300 mg/day) decreased delavirdine (400 mg q 8h) AUC by about 80%, Cmax by about 75%, and mean trough plasma concentrations by about 95%. Based on comparisons with historical data, delavirdine appeared to increase the AUC of rifabutin by at least 100% (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions).

                                    In 16 HIV-infected patients on zidovudine (100 or 200 mg q 4h), rifabutin (300 or 450 mg/day) lowered the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine by about 48% and 32%, respectively. However, zidovudine levels remained within the therapeutic range during coadministration of rifabutin. Zidovudine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin.

                                    The structurally similar drug, rifampin, is known to reduce the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs (see prescribing information for rifampin). Although rifabutin is a weaker enzyme inducer than rifampin, rifabutin may be expected to have some effect on those drugs as well.
