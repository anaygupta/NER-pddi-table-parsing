                           Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors      (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations. Limit      pioglitazone hydrochloride dose to 15 mg daily. (2.3, 7.1)
                           CYP2C8 inducers (e.g.,      rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations. (7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.1 Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors
                     
                        An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (tÂ½) of pioglitazone. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone hydrochloride is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.2 CYP2C8 Inducers
                     
                        An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone. Therefore, if an inducer of CYP2C8 is started or stopped during treatment with pioglitazone hydrochloride, changes in diabetes treatment may be needed based on clinical response without exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 45 mg for pioglitazone hydrochloride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
