                        Following an intravenous dose of 1 gram, serum concentrations were 110 mcg/mL at 5 minutes, declining to less than 1 mcg/mL at 4 hours. The half-life after an intravenous dose is 41 to 59 minutes. Approximately 85 percent of cefoxitin is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 6-hour period, resulting in high urinary concentrations. Probenecid slows tubular excretion and produces higher serum levels and increases the duration of measurable serum concentrations.
                        Cefoxitin passes into pleural and joint fluids and is detectable in antibacterial concentrations in bile.
                        In a published study of geriatric patients ranging in age from 64 to 88 years with normal renal function for their age (creatinine clearance ranging from 31.5 to 174.0 mL/min), the half-life for cefoxitin ranged from 51 to 90 minutes, resulting in higher plasma concentrations than in younger adults. These changes were attributed to decreased renal function associated with the aging process.

                        The bactericidal action of cefoxitin results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Cefoxitin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The methoxy group in the 7α position provides cefoxitin with a high degree of stability in the presence of beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of gram-negative bacteria. 
                        Cefoxitin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.

                           Susceptibility Tests
                           
                              
                                 Dilution Techniques:
                              
                              Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC’s). These MIC’s provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MIC’s should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method(1) (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of cefoxitin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:
                              



                              


Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard cefoxitin powder should provide the following MIC values:
                              


                              



                                 Diffusion Techniques:
                              
                              Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure (2) requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30-mcg cefoxitin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to cefoxitin.
                              Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30-mcg cefoxitin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:
                              



                              


Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques.
                              Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for cefoxitin.
                              As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30-mcg cefoxitin disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains:
                              


                              



                                 Anaerobic Techniques:
                              
                              For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to cefoxitin as MIC’s can be determined by standardized test methods (3). The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the following criteria:
                              


                              


Interpretation is identical to that stated above for results using dilution techniques.
                              As with other susceptibility techniques, the use of laboratory control microorganisms is required to control the technical aspects of the laboratory standardized procedures. Standard cefoxitin powder should provide the following MIC values:
