                  Octreotide acetate exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin.  It is an even more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin.  Like somatostatin, it also suppresses LH response to GnRH, decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide.
                  By virtue of these pharmacological actions, octreotide acetate has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea).  
                  Octreotide acetate substantially reduces growth hormone and/or IGF-I (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly.
                  Single doses of octreotide acetate have been shown to inhibit gallbladder contractility and to decrease bile secretion in normal volunteers.  In controlled clinical trials the incidence of gallstone or biliary sludge formation was markedly increased (see

                  Octreotide acetate suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        After subcutaneous injection, octreotide is absorbed rapidly and completely from the injection site.  Peak concentrations of 5.2 ng/mL (100 mcg dose) were reached 0.4 hours after dosing.  Using a specific radioimmunoassay, intravenous and subcutaneous doses were found to be bioequivalent.  Peak concentrations and area under the curve values were dose proportional after intravenous single doses up to 200 mcg and subcutaneous single doses up to 500 mcg and after subcutaneous multiple doses up to 500 mcg t.i.d. (1,500 mcg/day).
                        In healthy volunteers the distribution of octreotide from plasma was rapid (tα1/2 = 0.2 h), the volume of distribution (Vdss) was estimated to be 13.6 L, and the total body clearance ranged from 7 L/hr to 10 L/hr.  In blood, the distribution into the erythrocytes was found to be negligible and about 65% was bound in the plasma in a concentration-independent manner.  Binding was mainly to lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, to albumin.
                        The elimination of octreotide from plasma had an apparent half-life of 1.7 to 1.9 hours compared with 1 to 3 minutes with the natural hormone.  The duration of action of octreotide acetate is variable but extends up to 12 hours depending upon the type of tumor.  About 32% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine.  In an elderly population, dose adjustments may be necessary due to a significant increase in the half-life (46%) and a significant decrease in the clearance (26%) of the drug.
                        In patients with acromegaly, the pharmacokinetics differ somewhat from those in healthy volunteers.  A mean peak concentration of 2.8 ng/mL (100 mcg dose) was reached in 0.7 hours after subcutaneous dosing.  The volume of distribution (Vdss) was estimated to be 21.6 ± 8.5 L and the total body clearance was increased to 18 L/h.  The mean percent of the drug bound was 41.2%.  The disposition and elimination half-lives were similar to normals.
                        In patients with renal impairment the elimination of octreotide from plasma was prolonged and total body clearance reduced.  In mild renal impairment (ClCR 40 to 60 mL/min) octreotide t1/2 was 2.4 hours and total body clearance was 8.8 L/hr, in moderate impairment (ClCR 10 to 39 mL/min) t1/2 was 3 hours and total body clearance 7.3 L/hr, and in severely renally impaired patients not requiring dialysis (ClCR <10 mL/min) t1/2 was 3.1 hours and total body clearance was 7.6 L/hr.  In patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, total body clearance was reduced to about half that found in healthy subjects (from approximately 10 L/hr to 4.5 L/hr).
                        Patients with liver cirrhosis showed prolonged elimination of drug, with octreotide t1/2 increasing to 3.7 hr and total body clearance decreasing to 5.9 L/hr, whereas patients with fatty liver disease showed t1/2 increased to 3.4 hr and total body clearance of 8.2 L/hr.
