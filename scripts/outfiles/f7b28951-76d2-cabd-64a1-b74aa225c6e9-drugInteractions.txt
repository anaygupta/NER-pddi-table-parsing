                        Nateglinide is highly bound to plasma proteins (98%), mainly albumin. In vitro displacement studies with highly protein-bound drugs such as furosemide, propranolol, captopril, nicardipine, pravastatin, glyburide, warfarin, phenytoin, acetylsalicylic acid, tolbutamide, and metformin showed no influence on the extent of nateglinide protein binding. Similarly, nateglinide had no influence on the serum protein binding of propranolol, glyburide, nicardipine, warfarin, phenytoin, acetylsalicylic acid, and tolbutamide in vitro. However, prudent evaluation of individual cases is warranted in the clinical setting.
                        Certain drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), salicylates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, non-selective beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, guanethidine, and CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole, amiodarone, miconazole, oxandrolone) may potentiate the hypoglycemic action of nateglinide and other oral antidiabetic drugs.
                        Certain drugs including thiazides, corticosteroids, thyroid products, sympathomimetics, somatropin, rifampin, phenytoin and dietary supplements (St Johnâ€™s wort) may reduce the hypoglycemic action of nateglinide and other oral antidiabetic drugs. Somatostatin analogues may potentiate or attenuate the hypoglycemic action of nateglinide.
                        When these drugs are administered to or withdrawn from patients receiving nateglinide, the patient should be observed closely for changes in glycemic control.
