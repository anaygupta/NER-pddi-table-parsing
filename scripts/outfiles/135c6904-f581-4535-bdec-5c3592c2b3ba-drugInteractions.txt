The pressor response of adrenergic agents may also be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants, propranolol, reserpine, guanethidine, methyldopa, and atropine-like drugs. Phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solutions may potentiate the cardiovascular depressant effects of potent inhalation anesthetic agents.
