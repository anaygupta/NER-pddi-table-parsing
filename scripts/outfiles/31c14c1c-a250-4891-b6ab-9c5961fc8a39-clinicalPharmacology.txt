                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic narcotic antitussive and analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known; however, hydrocodone is believed to act directly on the cough center. In excessive doses, hydrocodone will depress respiration. Hydrocodone can produce miosis, euphoria, and physical and physiological dependence.
                        Guaifenesin is an expectorant the action of which promotes or facilitates the removal of secretions from the respiratory tract. The precise mechanism of action of guaifenesin is not known; however, it is thought to act as an expectorant by increasing the volume and reducing the viscosity of secretions in the trachea and bronchi. In turn, this may increase the efficiency of the cough reflex and facilitate removal of the secretions.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Systemic exposure (in terms of peak plasma concentrations and area under plasma concentration versus time curve) of hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin after single dose administration of 10 mL OBREDON Oral Solution are equivalent to respective reference solutions of 5 mL hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg/5 mL), and 10 mL guaifenesin (200 mg/5 mL).
                        Hydrocodone: Following a single 10 mL oral dose of OBREDON Oral Solution administered to 36 healthy adults (19-74 years), the geometric mean C
         
 
  max and AUC
         
 
  0-inf for hydrocodone were 12.6 ng/ml and 80.9 ng·hr/ml, respectively. The median time to maximum concentration for hydrocodone was about 1.25 hours. Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of hydrocodone. The mean plasma half-life of hydrocodone is approximately 5 hours.
        

 
                        Guaifenesin: Following a single 10 mL oral dose of OBREDON Oral Solution administered to 57 healthy adults (19-74 years), the geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-inf for guaifenesin were 3.7 mcg/ml and 4.2 mcg·hr/ml, respectively. The median time to maximum concentration was about 20 minutes. The effect of food on guaifenesin systemic exposure is not considered to be clinically meaningful. The mean plasma half-life of guaifenesin is approximately 1 hour.
                        
                           
                              Drug interactions
                           
                        
                        When guaifenesin and hydrocodone were administered in combination, the pharmacokinetics for each component were similar to those observed when each component was administered separately.
