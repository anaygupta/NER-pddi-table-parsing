                  3% Sorbitol Urologic Irrigating Solution is useful as an irrigating fluid for the urinary bladder because the sorbitol solution is nonhemolytic, electrically nonconductive, and provides a high degree of visibility for urologic procedures requiring endoscopy. During transurethral surgical procedures, the solution acts as a lavage for removing blood and tissue fragments. It is also useful as an irrigating fluid to maintain the patency of an indwelling catheter in the immediate postoperative period. If absorbed either intravascularly or extravascularly during transurethral resections, the sorbitol will be either metabolized to carbon dioxide and water via the fructose pathway, or excreted by a normally functioning kidney.
