                  Gentamicin Sulfate is a wide spectrum antibiotic that provides highly effective topical treatment in primary and secondary bacterial infections of the skin. This product may clear infections that have not responded to other topical antibiotic agents. In impetigo contagiosa and other primary skin infections, treatment with a small amount of Gentamicin Sulfate Ointment three to four times daily usually clears the lesions promptly. In secondary skin infections, the product facilitates the treatment of the underlying dermatosis by controlling the infection. Bacteria susceptible to the action of Gentamicin Sulfate include sensitive strains of Streptococci (group A beta-hemolytic, alpha-hemolytic), Staphylococcus 
                     aureus (coagulase positive, coagulase negative, and some penicillinase-producing strains), and the gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas
