                  Pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed in patients to establish the extent, if any, to which concomitant medications may alter Amyvid image results.

                  Within a clinical study of patients with a range of cognitive impairment, some patients with probable AD were receiving the following medications: donepezil, galantamine, memantine. Mean cortical Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) ratios did not differ between the patients taking or not taking these concomitant medications. In in vitro tests, none of the drugs tested, including the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, galantamine, and tacrine, altered florbetapir F 18 binding to its target.
