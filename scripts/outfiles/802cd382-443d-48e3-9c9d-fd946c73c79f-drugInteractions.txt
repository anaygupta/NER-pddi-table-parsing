                  Drug interactions with the use of PENNSAID have not been studied. The following drug interactions [Sections 7.1 to 7.7] are noted for oral diclofenac sodium.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Concomitant administration of diclofenac and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects including increased GI bleeding. (7.1)
                           Concomitant use of anticoagulants and diclofenac have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone. (7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Aspirin
                     
                        When diclofenac is administered with aspirin, the binding of diclofenac to protein is reduced, although the clearance of free diclofenac is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, concomitant administration of diclofenac and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Anticoagulants
                     
                        The effects of anticoagulants such as warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3	ACE-Inhibitors
                     
                        NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Consider this interaction in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4	Diuretics
                     
                        Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. The response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, observe the patient closely for signs of renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)], as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5	Lithium
                     
                        NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs, including diclofenac, and lithium are administered concurrently, observe patients carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6	Methotrexate
                     
                        NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Monitor renal function when prescribing PENNSAID concomitantly with methotrexate.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.7	Cyclosporine
                     
                        Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, may affect renal prostaglandins and increase the toxicity of certain drugs. Therefore, concomitant therapy with diclofenac may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Monitor renal function when prescribing PENNSAID concomitantly with cyclosporine.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.8	Oral Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
                     
                        Concomitant use of oral NSAIDs with PENNSAID 1.5% has been evaluated in one Phase 3 controlled trial and in combination with oral diclofenac, compared to oral diclofenac alone, resulted in a higher rate of rectal hemorrhage (3% vs. less than 1%), and more frequent abnormal creatinine (12% vs. 7%), urea (20% vs. 12%) and hemoglobin (13% vs. 9%). Therefore, do not use combination therapy with PENNSAID and an oral NSAID unless the benefit outweighs the risk and conduct periodic laboratory evaluations.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.9	Topical Treatments
                     
                        Instruct patients that before applying sunscreen, insect repellant, lotion, moisturizer, cosmetics, or other topical medication to the same skin surface of the knee treated with PENNSAID they must wait until the treated area is completely dry.
