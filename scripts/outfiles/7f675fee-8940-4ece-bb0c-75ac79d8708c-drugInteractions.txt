                  As with the use of other replacement solutions, blood concentrations of filterable drugs may be influenced by CRRT.
                  The blood concentrations of certain drugs may need to be monitored and appropriate therapy implemented to correct for removal during treatment. In patients with cardiovascular disease, especially those using cardiac glycoside medications, plasma levels of calcium, potassium and magnesium must be carefully monitored.
