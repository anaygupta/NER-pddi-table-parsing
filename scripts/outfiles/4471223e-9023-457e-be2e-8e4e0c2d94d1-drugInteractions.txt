                  Telithromycin is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and also a CYP3A4 substrate. Co-administration of KETEK and drugs that induce or inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may affect KETEK plasma concentrations resulting in diminished efficacy or an increase or prolongation of both the therapeutic and adverse effects; therefore, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary for drugs co-administered with telithromycin. 
                  Studies were performed to evaluate the effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors on telithromycin and the effect of telithromycin on drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. In addition, drug interaction studies were conducted with several other concomitantly prescribed drugs. Table 3 summarizes both drugs with pharmacokinetics that are affected by KETEK as well as drugs that affect the pharmacokinetics of KETEK.
                  


               



               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              CYP3A4 inducers:  Decreased KETEK levels resulting in loss of efficacy. Avoid concomitant use. (7)
                           
                              CYP3A4 inhibitors:  Increased KETEK levels and risk of adverse reactions. Avoid concomitant use.  (7)
                           
                              Drugs metabolized via CYP3A4 pathway:  KETEK may increase levels of these concomitant medications. Avoid concomitant use. If not possible, monitor for concomitant drug toxicity. Consider dosage reduction. (7)
